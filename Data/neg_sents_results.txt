One reviewer mentioned that the samgyupsal ( pork belly ) was cut thinner than at other bbq restos , and that was actually something i did not like about i m ga nae , so hopefully they will cut that nonsense out as i am sure one day i will end up here wanting samgyupsal at 4 am and will be thoroughly disappointed if they bring me a plate of bacon - thin slices of meat !
Note that portions are pretty big , and as one other reviewer mentioned , the menu prices do include the tax so do not be alarmed .
After waiting about 20 minutes for a seat , we ended up at a table where we had to sit cross - legged , traditional styles , which would not have been my first choice , but i did not want to wait to eat any longer .
Some people do not mind , i guess .
The soondubu was not at all spicy and contained mostly seafood , kimchi , and soft tofu .
And the wait staff do speak english so not to worry .
Maybe with the different layout , it seemed bigger , or maybe it was all the fluffy winter coats all over the place that made me feel suffocated , i do not know , but space can be a little cramped .
Just remember not to wear something too nice if you are ordering bbq as you will be grilling it at your table .
I can not say enough great things about the food here .
Not just good , but great !
I am not italian , but comparing to all the other italian restaurants i have dined at , this ones seemed extra authentic .

Can not wait to go back :)
I did not specifically get dr.
I have not been to the doctor since i got lasik a few years ago , and i mainly just went to get occasional glasses since i am still pretty nearsighted .
From my sh*tty seat in the back , i honestly could not tell if some of the background dancers were dudes in drag , or just bigger ladies .
He made the point to say that he was not billing for it , he just wanted to be thorough .
I told him that i have insurance so it does not matter to me , but i was impressed that he was that honest and caring .
The only negative is that they do not do glasses on site , so i still have to find a place to pick out frames and do the lenses , but that 's only a minor inconvenience .
I will probably find a better price not getting it in a doctors office anyway .
The bathroom was so bad that i could not use it so i held it till i got to a different restaurant .
They were not exceptional ( like the chicken wings ) , but they were tasty and a good accompaniment to the wings .
I would not recommend them .
So , it felt like we were in a small neighborhood , not in the middle of uptown .
We never have a problem when we dine in , the waitresses are very nice i wish i could remember their names ... there 's a older lady with long blonde hair she mainly works over by the restrooms and their a younger lady with dark hair that 's always in a bun on top of her head .
Which took 20 mins he finally got the food took it home and the order was not exactly what we ordered .
I honestly do not know alot about hawaiian food .
I did not realize when i ordered it had pork in it .
I hope i do not jinx this place as i have to bona , carlos kitchen , and paparazzi grill .
Everyone in my group liked what they had , no complaints .
We eat lunch here at least once if not three times a month .
Do not ask me why i keep frequenting chain restaurants -- i must be a glutton for punishment .
Last night , i met a couple friends here and this time i ordered the outback special sirloin with the lobster and mushroom topping ( an extra $ 3.95 ) for the more " indulgent steak experience , " as stated on the menu . so the appetizer and salad came out fine , no problems thus far .
The steak was decent and cooked correctly , however i was disappointed because the lobster and mushroom topping came out 10 minutes after my steak , which was cold by now and the " topping " was not really a lobster topping with mushrooms , it was more of a lobster bisque with mushrooms .
If i had known it was going to be so disappointing , i would not have bothered to wait for it while my steak got cold .
It would have been nice if the server apologized and took the " topping " off my bill ( yes , it was just $ 3.95 but it 's the principle of the matter ) , or offered a free dessert , but there was no accountability .
I do not expect to have another indulgent steak experience at outback anytime soon .
Not quite a 4 , but not a 3 in my book ( obviously since i wish i could give it a 3.5 on the scoring .
Not many places have an area that converts from a stage at night to tables during the day .
Nothing to write home about , but it 's not necessarily bad .
I wrote another review for a denny 's in payson ( that was not shining ) but it reminded me how awesome this one is .
Was not overly impressed with the food or beer selection .
Both looked delicious as they were served to us but there was not much in the way of flavor .
Not only was it the best decision but the staff was so great .
Side salad # 2 : wedge $ 6 ... not worth ordering .
I would get the filet and scallops again and not the wedge salad .
Service was a little slow but was not a huge deal .
You can ask him anything , and he does not mind you standing over his shoulder asking questions !!
And twice , i bought fruit yogurt that did not actually have any fruit in it .
Could have given us more olive oil and vinegar for the bread , but our pastas had come so it was not a big deal .
Would love to sit on the patio if i ever come again , but with pastas slightly pricier than i usually have , i probably will not plan a visit back here .
I will never again come to this place !
When i finally got to dr wellish , he was in such a meat market rush that i do not think he understood or cared enough to listen to what i was describing - said i had dry eyes ( which seems to be the buzz word of the office as there was notices everywhere and a " survey " about the topic required ) - maybe it s a huge profit center .
I was rushed out with copay and eyedrops paid for - and absolutely no feeling of a solution or even understanding of why i was there .
Big may be a big outfit but not better .
Top it off with fabulous service from frederick , this place can not be beat .
The onion soup was perfect ( not too salty like most other places ) , the raspberry viniagrette salad was delicious , the button mushrooms were huge and scrumptious , and we had prime rib ( 2 ) and filet with shrimp for our entrees .
I just can not say enough about this place .
It 's not often i think of dining here because it 's in the cannery , but i am so thankful i remembered this hidden gem .
I can not say enough great things about this practice , dr. wellish , dr. mccandless , and the staff .
I really could not be happier .
I am thinking the people that frequent this place has never had real bbq or there are not that many options in north scottsdale .
Can get quite busy and may need to line up , and they do not take reservation .
Tip : you have to ask for lettuce wrap , they do not serve it with the sauce / garlic as other kbbq places do .
If that was not filling enough , i recommend getting their pork bone soup !
It was a busy saturday night , we did not have a reservation but the 1 hour wait was absolutely worth it .
Five minutes after being seated waitress came by and informed us that they can not serve pancakes since the cabinet they keep pancake mix is locked by manager who is not on shift .
We started looking at other options and asked her about few other items and answer was no to french toast and few other items .
As we decided to leave another waiter ( who was saw standing outside texting ) came by and told us not to go to ihop since they have long wait times .
We called ihop and they did not have any wait time .
I do not think i be coming back to denny 's since we had called ahead the night before informing we would be coming early morning .
But instead of quality service we got " things are locked by manager " and do not go to ihop as sales pitch .
I did call next day to whisper complain but the manager was not interested in reaching out after bad experience .
I guess they really do not care about customers .
Would not be back or recommend it to anyone .
Always enjoy the sesame rice crackers ... did not enjoy the roasted seaweed snack .
I do not have another choice here , and so i go .
It 's not a " past its prime " sort of thing ...
It 's a " the produce just is not as good as i 'd like " sort of thing .
The reasons i do not mind spending $ 5 on a bag of salad .
I will still go because there are things i can not get anywhere else ( love the laundry detergent and price of organic taters ) but it will never be a place i do all my shopping unless the greens get better .
Will not go here again .
Never disappointed with the food or the service .
I could not be more happier with the results .
A few months ago , i was experiencing some irritation in my right eye and was not sure of the cause .
Finally i found wellish vision institute because i could not take the irritation and saw they had great reviews .
Ortiz but he could not figure out what the issue was .
No matter what day or time , there seems to always be something new to sample .
Would have never thought to try , but ended up buying a whole packet .
Korean grill house is located on yonge between gerrard and gould on the east side and is located on the upper level of the building ( this is confusing , i have no idea what 's on the bottom but i have always been taken upstairs ) .
And the guy on the phone who took my order was not personable at all .
Since my hair is super long and light brown , it s definitely not mine .
Just when i thought the taste would still prevail , i crunch down on something so hard , i can not bite through it .
The food here that i have had has been quite good and for the price , you really can not beat it .
That 's a big huge fail and i am only hoping i chewed everything well enough that i did not swallow any ceramic and encounter any issues later on .
Overall , good food , not worth the risk of who knows what being in your food .
Fail to the n-th degree , i will never come back here ever again and i recommend the same to you .
Linda offered me the services again i accepted the facial , i did not feel it was necessary to comp me the entire day .
I am generally not a harsh critic for many things , if there is effort involved i would not be quick to judge on a first visit basis , but waiting almost 45 minutes just to be approached and then asked what we would like to drink is lousy .
That 's almost saying that you straight up , do not care .
Even on a friday / saturday night with the place packed that would not be okay .
This place 's location can not be beat so we decided out of convenience to give it a try it .
Although not sure what the lower level is for , we headed upstairs .
Food came promptly , however , the first round , we ordered chicken and few others which did not all come .
I guess it slows down the cooking process so you do not get to eat as much ?
The service was not overall too bad and the servers did attend to us whenever we needed something .
For the price , i would say it 's decent for what you get but it 's too bad they do not include dessert like their competitor .
Overall , i still prefer chako and do not think i would return again .
One issue i had here though was not food or service but the bill .
I do not recall seeing it mentioned anywhere but i think they automatically charge a service charge or something because the bill came to $ 24 after tax which was only suppose to be $ 18.99 plus taxes .
I did not realize it was more than i should have paid until after i left .
I ordered some more side dishes and did not even get them .
I can not rave about the wellsh eye center enough !
I had no complications with my lasik .
I can not believe i waited so long !
I have been using glasses since the age of 15 so not having to search for my glasses first thing in the morning is a great feeling .
He took the check but never returned with the change .
I do not like how they do not take ressos during the week days but i quickly got past that .
I can not recall one complaint being said about the meal or the service .
Not one !
She did not over crowd us or give the hairy eyeball to leave when it started to busy - up .
I did not find my meal too heavy at all which is rare for a creamy pasta dish .
I honestly can not wait to return to grazie .
Nice little place and not the average menu items either .
You 'd never know it was previously an eat n park .
There are not many non-fast food restaurants in streetsboro and there are even fewer that are not chains .
Below is the response i received from them ( i removed last names ) : dear becky , we have no idea who you are or who you think you are judging our company who has been in business for over 35 years ... you are not our customer .
About the only thing you did agree with our office staff is that he did not drop them off until the afternoon of may 10 and when he called us that day he expected an appointment immediately .
We advised him we could not guarantee somebody out there as our schedule was full but we would try to get somebody there that day or friday .
A. is busy , as are we , but we can not make him find the time to drop them off as he had expected .
Additionally , your pool is cloudy at worse , not green .
A. cancelled to look for grids on his own , you would not be having this problem created by the grids not being authorized by mr .
It is understandable that home owners are trying to cut back on expenses but we can not take the heat for that situation .
What they do not know is that our landlord is one of our closest friends and everything he tells me is the truth .
Good thing i did not let my kids go swimming .
Good , not great .
No tomato , no cheese .
I literally told her i am not satisfied with her service and that has nothing to do with her servants but her .
The food were okay but i would not go back to this place because of this lady manager .
Second of all , they messed up our order of drinks , and did not refill after we asked them .
Third of all , as we were eating , we were told that the restaurant was closing in 15 mins , and our grill will be turned off at 12 am and we will not be able to cook any of our food which just arrived .
One more thing is , there was a waiter there does not speak english .
I would never go back to this korean grill house .
Two things that are not ok is the service and the cleanliness .
The waitress was ok but did not clear the dishes or refill drinks without being asked .
There was a huge mess on the floor below our table where a family of 8 had all of their kids before us and no one thought to sweep under the table or wipe the chairs before sitting a new group .
The rest of the restaurant was no better , including the bathrooms .
If that is what we could see , imagine what we could not see in the kitchen !
They make the best steaks ... better than any of the steak chains by far and not as pricey !
We have not been to this denny's in a long time due to the horrible service and understaffed .
Tonight was no different , waited over a hour and still no food .
This place is not managed well .
They were not that busy & this has happened to us 3 x now it should not take 1 - 1 / 2 hours to get in / out after a 5 min .
We were never asked how we wanted out meat cooked so i guess the default is very well done .
I do not know if they changed their recipes when they changed their menus but it was a way overpriced applebee 's .
When you are tired , do not really know what you want to eat or you just do not want to cook , hickory tavern offers an eclectic variety of choices for the whole family .
I do not often order a po ' boy sandwich but after enjoying this one , it might just be back on my items to order more frequently .
Not sure why hubby 's short on words today .
The food seemed to take awhile , but so long as the iced tea kept flowing , not a problem . :)
Can not complain .
This place is not the same place as it was several years ago .
You think i am kidding , but i am not .
We could not believe it .
Ok , so i am not a big fan of chains but my hubby and my bff 's hubby love it here so we recently did a couple 's night and i realized i had not written a review .
If you have never been to an outback stake house you are in for a treat .... or maybe not .
Price here is not too bad .
Dinner for two will set you back only about $ 20 , which is not bad in my opinion .
In case you are not in the know , a loco moco consist of rice , hamburger , eggs , and gravy .
This order filled me up , but i was not done .
Kc did not have a katsu masubi , so a regular spam it is .
I was little disappointed with kc 's spam masubi only because it was small , not as tightly wrapped , and the spam was a bit undercooked .
I want to say that kauai cafe is just okay , but i really have not tried anything else .
I still have their kalbi to try ( even though i stole a bite from tr ) , their katsu , their heineken battered chicken , and ahi ahi ( can not remember if they have that one ) .
It 's going to be tough for me to judge that one since i do not eat much pork .
I asked aaron pools about it and i was told that since it 's a heater problem they can not do anything about it unless i submit a separate home warranty claim specific to the heater .
When the aaron pools looked at the pool again , i was told that a " heater bypass valve " was cranked the wrong way and that i just should not ever mess with that valve .
Of course , i did not mess with that valve -- never have -- it says " heater bypass valve " and until then the heater was working great ( used it twice in the month before the service without issue ) , so why would i move it ?
I pointed out that the only person who would have moved that was the technician who replaced the salt cell , so please do not charge me for the second service .
I submitted a complaint to the bbb and the owner of aaron pools said " we did not charge you for any return visit , the home warranty company has determined that a salt cell claim and a heater claim are separate issues .
Therefore the home warranty company charged an additional service fee . " of course , this is false -- aaron pools told me to submit the heater claim -- the home warranty company does not care if aaron pools fixed the problems causes without charging extra .
I called the home warranty company and was told that it can not waive the charge because it prepays the service companies when each claim comes in .
Obviously aaron pools knew that the service fee would not be waived . this is when i realized what i think is probably really going on : a little tweak by a technician on an unprofitable home warranty call -- a tweak that the homeowner does not know how to fix is an easy way to get a second call out to fix another problem and " earn " another service fee .

The owner of aaron pools claims that his company is not prepaid for service calls .
At this point , however , i frankly do not believe this statement .
Second , do not allow them to pressure you into a second claim -- it 's the same claim if it resulted from aaron pools own actions . ( side note , it is theoretically possible that the initial cranking of the heater bypass valve was done innocently by the first technician in order to reduce flow to take the salt cell out of the water circuit , and then forgot to turn it back .
But i do not think so , because ( 1 ) the owner of the company was dishonest with me -- dishonesty appears to be a company policy , ( 2 ) if the technician knew enough to crank it out of the way , he 'd know enough to crank it back , ( 3 ) an honest company would not charge for fixing that , and ( 4 ) the heater technician said bypassing the water circuit with the salt cell in it would be mostly ineffective . )
But for two people , one dish would probably not enough .
Each dish was 39 dollars , which is a tiny bit expensive for two people , since it s not really enough for two people , so you will probably have to get another smaller dish to share .
They obviously do not care much about their customers .
It was so long ago i was there i can not remember the service .
They do not let you go if you do not pay tip .
If you have left a cash tip on the table and want to pay the bill with a card , they will start asking why you did not add tip to the machine .
And let 's be real , the service is not even that great to be deserving a lot of tip
No one even acknowledged that i had been there nor offered us a drink .
While they do not have the inventory of a large grocery store , they have all your standards and some pretty good frozen food .
Do not ever leave here without checking your order !
My 9 yo son does not think they care about their customers , lol .
Sometimes , the restaurant does not seem well cared for .
The waitress we had really did not wait us .
Never asked how we were doing .
Never asked if we needed anything .
There was like no sauce on it .
My bf asked for no tomato .
Could not asked for sauce she did not come back except when she gave us our bill .
She was way friendlier to the other tables around us but not to us .
Could not tell you her name .
She did not say .
Skin looks great the day after my facial - extractions removed acne , no peeling or recovery and skin is glowing .
However , when i came for the pre-opp appointment dr. wellish identified that i had a rare corneal disease and told me he did not recommend any surgery because it would further damage my cornea which already had ailments .
He sent me home with no charge .
He could have done surgery that day , collected several thousand dollars from me and i likely would not have known for years that i did something that was not good for my eyes .
All of the other places i saw either ignored the condition or were not well enough trained to identify it .
If you want a great doctor welish is the best a 2 hours is nothing for a lifetime of sight if your getting the best traveling is no big deal for sight it 's relaxing and a peaceful place . , and you can watch your loved one getting it done if you choose so 2 hours or a lifetime there is no comparison they treat you like royalty .

We are here right now and will never be back .
The bartender would not serve my moms friend who is 30 because she thinks he is messed up .
This was really prejudice because he is not drunk and i ordered a drink and was not even id 'ed and i am only 21 .
We will never be coming here again .
Do not ever go to the hickory tavern on harris !!
I then asks for my itemized check and he acted like he did not know what i was talking about .
Do not go there !
Not only does he use the latest technology , his staff is very friendly .
Everything was very tasty i can not wait to go back and try their teri chicken and island burger , which first caught my eye .
I have been here several times ( only because it is the only bbq for miles ) and every time i have been here the kids that work here do not clean up .
If you are stuck on this side of town and want bbq i guess you are out of luck it s this place or no place .
Not as good as i thought from reading reviews .
Just something about the taste that was not what i am used to .
Ice tea was nothing but sugar water , could not taste any tea flavor .
Will not return , sorry
There was only one server but we did not wait too long for food but we were not in any rush .
Reasonably reasonable prices ( $35 for petite filet , $ 20 for chicken ) and bland - swanky decor ... sort of like a marie callender's of steakhouses , for boring married couples or retirees on budgets who never go out to a steakhouse .
In fact , i would have given it two stars ... except it gets an extra star for its blessed un- pretentiousness ( no stupid all - caps name , no deconstructed or fusion dishes , and no douchebaggy club music playing ) .
Prices are decent but the sushi seemed a bit not as fresh as other places and they are not as generous with the actual fish on their sushi dishes .
I like that their portions are just right , soup is not too salty , and did not taste like there was a whole lot of msg in it .
Not bad at all !
The one star rating is a place holder , it 's should be shut down due to no one working here .
Not to mention 11 people 2 grills oh baby .
I am not tipping this half ass service .
It 's unfortunate that it is not open on weekends .
Does anyone not like tj 's ?
I only wish they would not discontinue their products .
Every now and then i go in and find that one of my favorites is no longer available :(
The waiter was the worst waiter i have ever had anywhere and because of him the food was cold i also ordered a bottle of water that he never brought but as he was bringing the bill said " oh do you want me to bring you your bottle of water now " and it was on the bill i will never go back espically with marcellos pizzeria a few doors down
We will go back on a drunken night but we will not be regulars !!!!!
They have an extensive sushi menu and you will not be disappointed .
Can not say enough good things !
Was not too busy .
Service was pretty quick no issues there .
Definitely not on the cheaper side .
The broth was okay , it was not too greasy , but nothing spectacular .
No issues there .
However that was not the case here .
However if you are really hungry , you probably will not get full .
I have not tried them all yet , i always get there torino pasta and there amazing baked goat cheese salad .
The only thing i can say they should improve on is there mussels , they were not very fresh the last couple times i tried it .
It seemed fairly priced , clean looking , yet it was not quite welcoming .
I definitely do not believe it to have been fresh water at all .
I have had eel numerous times and at plenty places yet have never had such a salty and fishy tasting roll .
The taste was overwhelming and i could not force myself to suck down a second bite .
No sushi tho
Not very often a vegan goes to a steak house but sometimes when dealing with a large group of people , that 's where you end up .
While waiting for our table ( my only complaint ... our table was not ready until 45 minutes after our reservation ) , the owner was walking around offering samples and chatting with the waiting patrons .
I have to admit , it was quite a drive from henderson to get here , but i was not disappointed at all .
Do not get me wrong , i almost change my mind a few time because of the other mixed plates specials , but i am glad i did not .
From what i notice , kauai cafe will let you make a choice between white rice , fried rice or fried noodles at no extra cost .
I have to rate this chicken a 5 star winner , and i would drive 30 miles one way just to eat this again . i also ordered the portuguese bean soup ( $ 2.50 ) and it was better than island flavor , it was okay but i would not order it again .
Do not get me wrong the bugga was good , and had the perfect crust ( which is nearly the same as leonard 's in honolulu ) which had a slight crunch to it , and lightness for most of the madasada , but the very middle was still cold .
I believe they keep the madasada dough in the cold storage , and it was not completely thawed out , but i still enjoyed it , and for some reason the madasada was still good and moist the next day .
I have only ever been to helen because after my first pedi , i did not ever need to go to anyone else !
Helen is wonderful but all the gals here are fantastic so you can not go wrong .
We lucked out tonight ... was not super busy so our group of 7 was able to sit together ...
I enjoyed the kauai chicken ... now i do not normally like fried chicken but this was not your ordinary fried chicken .
The batter was super light and crispy and not greasy , and had a really good flavor and held the moisture to the chicken .
I did not like how the oil / vinegar is poured for you ..
This is not my favorite restaurant to sit and eat , but the to go is always good .
The combination of flavors is quite difficult to not love .
I do not buy it because the time i did i ate the entire thing in one day :(
I have not had any that i did not like .
Not to say they do not do their job , they just do not seem to ever want to be there and are plain flat when talking to them .
I do not hand out 5 stars casually .
When i said " for here , " i was invited to sit anywhere i wanted ( they were not very busy , lucky for me ! ) .
Not annoying , but there every time i would have wanted her to be .
Wow , super surprised to see the negative reviews , not sure if they changed things , or if some of the bad reviews are bogus , because my experience was perfect .
I opted to get the new motor , and weston did not put any pressure either way , in fact he suggested going with the refurb , so i was only out the cost of the copay .
Weston installed the brand new pump , and when i fired it up , i have never heard such a quiet pump , and my pool vacuum was swimming around so fast i thought it was on bath salts .
I would have no hesitation in recommending them to a friend .
I can not help but point out the majority of the negative reviews are from people with limited or no profiles , or only one or two reviews and no photos .
Do not get wings on wing night .
We were looking for real italian food and grazie did not disappoint .
Not overly packed for a saturday after hours .
Hope i do not miss my flight .
Also the waitress offered us a free dessert because the friend i was with did not write in his gratuity correctly .
I did not care for the manager ... he was really rude !!!!
Note to manager : do not interrupt your staff when they are speaking to a customer just because a high - roller enters the restaurant !!!
The food is good , overall dining experience was good , but this review is for the price ... seriously we had the beef wellington dinner that had potatoes and carrots on the side ..$ 40 the meal itself , i would not have paid no more than $ 25 and that 's still a lot .
The pastry was way bigger then the meat and burned on the bottom , the salads are separate we paid 200 $ for 4 of us and i honestly could of eaten at a strip big name 5 star that was a 4 coarse meal for that price , i mean i guess if you have the money and you do not even care because the economy is beneath you than be my guest , but if i am gon na pay for a meal like that i wan na say i spent my money well .
Food is good but not worth the price they ask for , you could eat at texas road house / outback same kind of meal for cheaper .... that 's the truth !!!
If you want texas barbecue this is not it !
I do not know why and how this place is getting 5 stars .
I got the quarter leg plate and i was not that impressed .
Did not know it was open 24 hours !
It turned out that my issue was not covered by the home warranty and was about to cost me .
I can not believe i waited so long to go to trader joes !
The only thing is every once and a while you will find some basic food item is not even available here .
The spicy sushi rolls do not disappoint .
The apple butter tasted like fall time . my husband is a fanatic of tuna sandwiches and usually he does not like it from other places only the ones i make him .
The veggies are not mixed in the egg which i like just in case there is something i do not like i can pick out but everything on it tasted amazing .
I only wished they had hot sauce but i get it 's not a breakfast joint it 's a bread company .
When the owner of the franchise has the customer service skills of an angry ape , it 's no suprise fellow yelpers are down on this place .
Not worth the time , maybe dickie 's corporate will take it back .
First off as soon as you walk in to outback the hostesses do not even great you at all !
Then after we order our drinks my fiancé asks for some sugar for his iced tea , never got any at all .
When it came down to the food i requested if they could add bacon on my burger , once it came out no bacon ( also we requested a few other things and we obviously did not get them the first time ) ... so i told the waiter it did not and explained to him it was not here at all and that since i already took a few bite out of my food i did not want to get the bacon anymore then .
I did not even get to finish my sentence till he stormed off and did other things .
My fiancé ordered the mushroom sauce steak , once it came out it was a plain steak with no sauce at all !
It was not even the way he wanted it .
The nice manager came around and apologized which was great and offered a free dessert ! ( did not get dessert because i wanted to leave so fast ) i did explain how rude the server was and that i did not appreciate him to walk off while i was still talking to him .
When the bill came the server charged me for the bacon which i made him correct ( i know it 's just a dollar but i am not gon na pay for something i did not get ) also on the bill they did not even give a small discount for the service at all which most places do !
So this is one unhappy customer that will not be coming back to this location for sure and will not be tipping this waiter !
You can not beat the pricing .
Our waitress was polite , but not prepared to answer my question as to what the soup option was .
And she did not offer to find out , just a reply of " i do not know " .
We asked waitress to remember to not charge us for it .
She returned to tell us she did , but that substitutions were not allowed for this meal , but they would allow it this time .
I do not think i will be going back to any of the chains .
I would not do it if i were you .....
I love that this location has dedicated , free parking and i do not even care that it 's sometimes hard to get in and out of .
Warning : this is not korean food .
The bbq meats like the chinese style " bulgogi " was not bad but do nt expect good quality meat .
Not the most cleanest place .
No problems what so ever .
The prices also did not break the bank .
They did not want to pay to clean up their mess so they lied to the home warranty .
Aaron pools is rude , untrustworthy and basically have no clue what they are doing .
Do not pay them $ $ $ $ to touch your pool .
Went inside and were not greeted until about fifteen minutes later when the waitress greeted and sat us .
You can not go wrong here
Our experience started off on a bad note , from which it never recovered , when the waitress brought us our first round of cocktails .... two in our party ordered moscow mule 's , but were served watered down ginger beer / vodka blends sans copper mug , mint , and ice .
Again , the waitress seemed barely bothered by the snafu , and we did not receive an apology or explanation by management .
I showed him the picture and explained the shrimp was not deveined , which seemed to baffle him .
I am not sure if he was in disbelief or was not sure what i meant by " the shrimp was not deveined " .
Either way , he did not respond to my negative experience in any way other than making a face and walking away ... in short , please do not waste your time or hard earned money at this has - been chain that no longer emphasizes customer service or palatable food .
I have never had an issue at another hickory tavern in the charlotte metro area .
The food is actually good enough that i put up with the service - so , it 's definitely a keeper , just do not be surprised when things go a bit off the rails ...
As i was looking at the menu a worker came up and asked what i wanted , and i told her i had not been there before and was trying to figure out how it works there .
I do not know where she went .
Short wait for my food , but when it came to me it was so heavy laden with hummus i could not taste anything else .
I even tried taking some if it off with my napkin , but i could not even finish half my sandwich that i paid almost $ 10 for ( no chips or drinks or anything else included ) .
Probably will not be coming back .
When we asked to see the manager the first time he did not show up for about 20 minutes and when he finally showed up it was obvious he did not care .
After that our waiter avoided us for the rest of the night and we did not get anymore service at all , except when the bill was dropped off .
I used to love this place but now i do not think i will ever be back
I literally have never felt bullied by a server the way this person made my ( perfectly respectful ) children and i feel .
The straw that broke the camels back was when he handed me some napkins ( i did not ask for them but he found time ) and said " you are welcome to leave as soon as you are finished eating " as a nurse , i understand that serving people can be difficult at times , but this guy needs to find a new line of work ... my six year old was even shocked !!
I waited for dillons return , which never came and when jennifer returned i asked her if he was refusing to apologize to me to which she replied that he was .
Go be a woman hater somewhere else buddy ... denny 's ai not your gig !
- there is no ventilation in this place so you gon na walk out smelling like korean food .
Pass the kimchi stew , bland and kimchi was not sour enough .
Definitely not homemade .
The wait time was not bad at all .
I have waited longer at airports and when it comes to my vision i do not care how long i have to wait .
I can not thank him and his entire staff enough !
After about 20 minutes she comes out with everything in a to go bag , when i said i ordered it for here the lady just looked at me with no explanation and turned around and walked away .
All i can say about the food is it was ok for what it was but for sure did not like the egg drop soup .
Could not understand the lady at the counter very well at all either .
She did not speak very good english .. maybe that 's why she packed my food to go .
I wait and wait ... i do not want to be rude , i know they see me , i think they understand that i am a potential customer .
Definite waste of eleven bucks , i do not see me going back anytime soon .
Not impressed .
No , i will not be shopping there for a while .
Me thinks not .
The restaurant is unbelievably fast as i do not think i have ever waited more than 10 minutes before .
We can use more decent bbq places around the valley , but this location will not be one of them .
Louis or baby backs and the chef did not even know what kind of ribs they sell he could only tell me they were pork ribs .
Large bowl lined with pita's with and a mound of lettuce in the center and not just lettuce but a bounty of tomatoes , cucumbers , large fresh croutons and an incredible amount of chicken .
My wife always complains to salad that are just about all lettuce and maybe one sliver of tomato but not this time .
They do not have desserts or a big menu but with what they serve looks so good and taste so good that you make plans for the next visit when you are still there and still recovering from that kanack attack .
It 's fried but felt light and not greasy at all .
You do nt get lau lau or kalua pig like another hawaiian place in the sw , you get lau lau and kalua pig and you get more extra items that s not old like that same other place .
I do not know how to explain it , everything looked bright like i was looking out of a hd lense .
Lol i do not know i am weird .
No ketchup .
No silverware .
We will not be going back .
The tech was supposed to call me , and report what was found ... but did not .
Our entire pool water was emptied and replaced about a month ago , the pool was crystal clear and the filter was working beautifully until the night it burst . the filter is probably 20 years old , and no longer manufactured , so parts are not made for it .
That algae would not cause the break in my filter .
When i called aaron 's pools they would not allow me to talk to the tech , i opened the filter up to look at it and i was told that the grey tinge to the outside of my de was algae .
I was told that the fins were crushed , they are not .
I truly feel that aaron pool 's just did not want to take the hit on the repair from ahs .
I could not resist and bought a beautiful makeup box of eyeshadows , lipsticks etc so mother in law could enjoy .
Very over priced and crappy customer service not even a smile when i walked in i had never been there before and they acted like i put them out by asking questions .
Another thing was that when i paid him the money , i have him $ 30 for a $ 24 meal ( the six dollars was tip ) , but he never bothered to ask if it was tip , and he just disappeared into the back with the $ 6 for like 15 minutes , until we left , pretty unprofessional .
I always get the chicken katsu plate lunch and it never disappoints .
Not unlike other places .
This was nice to see as they were not very busy .
Too many times , not being busy turns into bad service .
Not this time .
Worst denny 's ever and i do not expect much from this place to begin with .
Never ever return or go here .....
It did not disappoint .
As for the meat , they did not skimp out on the portions of pork belly or the kalbi .
That worked out with my family as my mom does not like tooo many layers of fat .
The kalbi was marinated very well with lots of flavors and we tried not to overcook it , so it was not too tough .
The only downside was that there was no ventilators above each table , so it can get a bit stuffy inside .
I can not wait until the next time i go !
We just can not go back .
It is not settling well with me .
It definitely is not chicken breasts , i will give them that .
He commented on how he did not need ketchup to finish it .
You will not be disappointed .
They have a seating area with no chairs so you take your shoes off and sit .
They did not bring us any tea or cups or any sort .
Even when they gave us chopsticks and spoons there was not any napkins and anything said from the waiter .
I had no insurance and he made sure he saw me every week at no charge for over a month .
I am extremely grateful and can not say enough about dr langford and his staff he truly is an exceptional dr .
He said , yes , no problem , as long as someone else has not asked for sound of another game first .
I ask about sound and the server said , sure , we have just got music playing , should not be a problem .
She comes back with our beers and being a polite person , and the game had not started yet , i did not ask about the sound .
We wait and wait , still no sound in the game .
We get our beers , and never see the server again .
I eventually just left cash on the table , no check ever came , no sound , absolutely ridiculous and just plain out rude .
We will not ever be back .
Shocking this place got good reviews ... no hi , hello or go to hell .
Wait try listen to this ... paid for my food and da dude tells me no more 1's so i am like okay ???
Leaves me hanging no explanation nothing .
His response no mo 1's ( freakin really ) ?
Finally i told him no tell me no mo 1's fix da problem .
I know the reviews were not great but we have been desperate for bbq so we thought we would get a variety of items - they could not all be bad , right ?
Just ok portion which worked out well since i did not feel as guilty tossing it into the garbage .
Brisket was fatty and bland , the sausage - i am not ready to discuss it yet , i will update the review if i ever get the stomach to speak about it again .
Roll was soft and pale so i did not bother and i was so grossed out after trying the meats stuffing dry squishy bread down my throat did not seem to be a good idea .
I gave it two stars because my sides were ok though i may never eat brisket again and i will burn rubber out of the parking lot of any restaurant that i ever see list cheddar sausage on their menu .
One thing for sure , i will not be eating at dickey 's again .
The food at this location is almost identical to the one at yonge / eglinton except that the service here is not as warm as i remembered .
We ordered the parma foccacia as the starter , and heed my warning - do not overstuff yourself with the rock - hard complimentary bread they give you , save room for the foccacia , it 's super fluffy and i would probably eat one whole as an entree ..
This vaughan location is not as packed as the midtown location , and it has plenty of parking available !
I am not too picky about the poor service here because of this convenience factor - at least the food is just as good !
They over cook things all the time , so they are dry and tasteless and try to cover it up with bbq sauce , well guys that does not work on anyone with taste buds .
I have called back 3 times since my initial call , well that was 2/15/13 and now it is 5/11/13 and still no contact back .
I found this odd , but we had booked the same event the year before and there had been no problem .
They told me they were not holding the room and if i wanted it , i had better get in and do a contract asap .
He could not care less or deliver any sort of an apology on the matter .
But i will not soon forget my horrible experience with this gm and i will never dine at hickory tavern again .
This restaurant is not the worst but is not the best either .
The manager does not take concerns very well .
Over priced and not impressed .
Portions were very small and just not worth the time or money .
Never got to order food .
No one even tried to stop us .
Will not be back
No one had any problems with their food , except one and the waiter fixed it before she could even tell him what was wrong .
Probably not any longer .
The fish was dry and over cooked , the veggies were undercooked , the lettuce was 20 % brown , the dressing was as thick as jello and there was not one slice of lemon to be found .
He is not the cheapest but i would not go anywhere for a lesser price - we only have one set of eyes
My husband had lasik almost 10 years ago in california , and i had always wanted to have it , but was too scared . i had a few consultations with doctors that were close to my home , but i just was not feeling the connection .
No other place that i went to prior even did half of what dr .
Wellish and his staff could be my doctor for everything ... not just eyes !!!!
I can not think of any doctor that i have been to in the past that i would hold to the same standard as dr.
Can not beat free !
As you walk in , the staff always give nice welcomes and is eager to show you around even if it 's not your first time .
- the locker area is small and with another person there simultaneously = very tight quarters - there is only one women 's restroom - there is not a lounging area for after your spa experience and having one would be nice - they offer a subpar biscotti as a snack with water - the lounging area available as you wait to get called back for your massage is not very inviting - perhaps a bigger space with more relaxed seating options - the prices are steep - expect to throw down when you come overall , i enjoy coming to the red door spa once in a while and i always call ahead to make an appointment with lisa .
And i actually do not mind if my asparagus is exposed to the air , it does not need to be in packaging .
And do not worry about it - if i want a green pepper , red pepper , and yellow pepper , i can find all three separately , they do not need to be wrapped together .
Other than that , i have just realized that you can not go to trader joe 's with your usual shopping list - you have to go there with a specific trader joe 's shopping list .
The bread was ick ... nothing at all special , the meat was dry and very bland with 2 tiny rings of onion and 2 small pickle slices .... if it wasent for the average bbq sauce i would have tossed the sandwich and learned where not to go for bbq !
Not bad !
I would not say it 's the best quality food since it 's not organic or anything , but for what it is .. not bad !
I would not say it 's the best quality food since it 's not organic or anything , but for what it is .. not bad !
However , i quickly became frustrated as soon as i wanted a beer and could not get any service .
I tried to go the bar to order a drink , but because i had said hello to my group of friends already at the tables , the bartender said i was not allowed to open a tab unless i was going to sit at the bar .
I never got a reason on why this was the case , but it was very frustrating .
As the rest of the group arrived on the bus , the problem became extremely obvious since no one was able to get a drink .
They were not willing to work with me .
I ended up having to express to the bar tenders that our group of 35 + people was going to have to leave and get service somewhere else if the situation did not improve .
We kept talking with no progress , but eventually a manager came over .
As a result of my experience , i would not recommend hickory tavern for large happy hour or drinking type events unless everyone is planning to be seated at the bar or at one table .
In general , you should not expect their bar environment to behave like a typical bar , even in the 11 pm - 2 am time period ( the hours that we were there ) .
I can not comment on the quality of their food or dining .
I can not speak to the dine - in experience but , i do enjoy the tasty food .
But the food was not that far removed from this restaurant 's normal everyday fare , which consists of fancy steakhouse offerings and fairly high - end continental cuisine .
Unfortunately , the same was true of a generous helping of roasted new york strip loin which was well - seasoned and tasty but not very hot .
Dessert was another unusual treat , which i will call " the dessert with no name , " since even the restaurant acknowledged upon being asked that it was a concoction waverly 's chef threw together , and did not name .
I had never encountered this type of problem here before when meals were individually cooked to order rather than en masse on a holiday .
The hamburger steak is like the loco moco but no egg .
I told her i did not want to get anyone else sick .
We could not believe how cheap the prices were , well we ordered two rolls , one for each , chicken fried rice for my husband and spicy teriyaki noodles for me .
Needless to say you get what you pay for , the rolls are tasteless , the chicken fried rice should be call peas fried rice , but the worse part of it all was my teriyaki noodles never came .
No apologies were given .
All we got was " you do not have to pay for the noodles " which i thought it was needless to say .
I mean they thought they were doing us a favor for not charging us for food we did not get .
Never going back here again .
The server does not even hesitate to move a chair out of the way so i can get the wheelchair under the table .. drink service is fast .
I gave them one star only because i could not give zero stars !
Outback should not hold their breath notill they see us again .
This is the first review on yelp i have left that is not 5 stars .
I did not have a pool company so relied on my home warranty company first american and they send aarons pool .
The capacitor did not fix my issue if it was replaced .
Aaron 's pool was obviously only interested in making a quick dollar from the warranty company and not gaining a potential lifelong customer .
My only regret is not finding / trying this place sooner .
Steaks are choice ( at best ) not prime .
The other items are just not worth having at all .
My boyfriend get takeout from this place whenever we want food that we know will not disappoint .
Next time i am going to eat inside so i can get try some of the fried items - they just do not do well for pick - up or delivery because they quickly get hard and cold - not the restaurants fault .
Not to mention that the sushi is good and very inexpensive .
Obviously it 's not the best in town but i have been there numerous times and i have yet to leave a review because i wanted to make sure it was not a flop but trust me , the the food is good and worth the money .
Definitely try it out if you are not trying to break the bank !
Can not go wrong with this place .
The only reason that this is not a 5 star review is because their dining area is a little dreary looking .
I do not know that i 'd want to sit and eat .
Never one to doubt yelp , i ordered the fried chicken platter with fried noodles and macaroni salad . ( $ 9.95 ) .
Not too thick or bread - y , and it had a delicious , sweet flavor .
I can not wait to try some of their other offerings in the future .
While simple , the decor was nice and the place was not too cramped or anything , just cozy .
While not the absolute best pho i have ever had it 's certainly worth a visit , i doubt anyone would be disappointed !
We decided to try it the other night when hawaiian turned out to be the compromise between korean and chinese ( do not ask ... ) for the hubster and i , and we were in the area .
I just can not ) we also got a spam masubi .
I tried a bit of the mac salad , and i was thrilled to discover that it was not overly mayo'd - something i can not stand .
Please i realize if it does not sell you lose money , but everybody says the samething ...
However , i remembered why i do not visit often .
The kind of place you can eat at a few times a week and not break the bank .
The dirty glasses was left on the bar it has not been wiped or clean from food being left in the counter .
Remind you it is a slow night and the bartender has not approached us or greeted us yet .
Never seen such a lazy ass bar tender who the hell wants to sit at a unclear bar .
Yes , it 's not really korean bbq .
Do not let the small main floor fool you .
Worst korean bbq i have ever had ... meat is not fresh , and very fatty !
All meat / fish is seasoned with so much salt / soy sauce too ... side dishes are not authentic , and they only give you a little bit .
Definitely not going back .
Trader joe 's is not for your full shopping trip .
One of my wow items that i can not live without is the concentrated coffee .
We patiently waited for the server to come take our order , she did not write it down and while i noticed her talking to another server when going back to enter the order she forgot and asked another server to come and ask what we ordered .
After serving our dinner she never came over to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything , or of my husband wanted another beer ( no up sale at all ) .
I am not a hard customer to please but when mistakes are made , they are best made and easily forgiven when the restaurant is busy and the servers are working .
I am not really a huge fan of trader joe 's .
I like a lot of the food , but there are a lot of options also that just do not live up to the expectations .
If you are going to be cooking for yourself , you do not need to come to trader joes .
Unfortunately , service here is slow and not that good compared to the other branches ..
Not worth 3 x the required every party .
We all ordered plenty of food with 2 single orders of meats and veggies and drinks , but " no sharing . "
This may stop me bringing a group as i 'd prefer better steak cuts and there 's no way i would be able to upgrade this .
At first i was pretty excited because i have heard alot of hype about korean - style grill places and having had the chinese - style hot - pot / grill combinations in the past i thought maybe the grill experience would not be that different albeit with a distinctly korean flair thrown in .
Well , it was certainly not a thrilling experience ... service was somewhat nice with a friendly accommodating waiter who suggested which daiquiris were favorites among the customers .
I have no idea what authentic , traditional korean grill cuisine is back in the " homeland " but i certainly agree with reviews of the korean yelpers on here who say that there is seemingly nothing authentic about this non-korean operated eatery .
Other than that , i really did not see anything else worth raving about regarding this particular type of culinary experience .
Ayce at japanese places , dim - sum and even hot pot places offer a bigger selection of items to choose from and i do not see why customers would have to pay extra to get raw vegetables .
My personal preference is the chicken teriyaki with no vegetables .
Think applebee 's atmosphere , with food that has no flavor whatsoever .
I got the shrimp tacos .. with no flavor .
I can not believe there are not more reviews for this business .
The process is clear cut with no unanswered questions .
The price is good and the sushi tasted great my normal sushi place though open had no cook or sushi chef so decided to try this place again i was impressed .
I we nt here for lunch on saturday ( yesterday ) there was an older man serving us i had gotten home from work at 5 am the night before and therefore i was very tired , no makeup and had a sweater on ... once he took our order , i asked if i could add pancetta on my pasta - this man had the audacity to say to me ' did you bring money with you ? ' with an attitude , and chuckled ..........
Not coming back .
Unfortunately we did not get to spend much time , but will definitely plan to do so when i return to the city .
But do not expect to eat on the cheap .
I used to believe that , just like there was no such thing as a bad day of golf ( or fishing ) , there was no such thing as bad barbecue .
Stacey 's bbq on shea no longer has a television .
I have never seen pork ribs with so much fat on them .
There was no discernible rub on the ribs .
No lemons .
My meal was everything barbecue was not supposed to be .
No one could get me in these doors again , not for love or money .
The coffee selection is great [ do not forget to grind it yourself ] and i love the green juice [!!!].
Explained everything that he was doing during the surgery and walked me through the procedure so that i was not surprised by anything .
I now have 20 / 20 vision - no complications , no problems and am so happy i went through with it .
My only regret is i did not get the surgery sooner .
Oh ! and i can not forget tehani - the patient relations girl at the front desk who set up all my appointments .
My expectations are not that high .
That said , i could not believe what they tried to serve this morning .
Called in for pick up and after having confirmed my order at least 3 times over the phone , i found that not only had they left 3 things off my order , but also that the pancake puppies were burnt beyond recognition to the point that they even burned through the styrofoam container they were put in .
No apologies or even a surprised tone ... just matter of factly .
When i asked if the replacement pancake puppies would be on her ( the principle ... not that the 1.99 was going to break me ) she said she reluctantly agreed to give a coupon for next time .
Do not think there will be a next time .
Can not wait to be hungover again so i can be cured with their island love .
We told the waitress that we did not like carrots and she said she would ask them if they could be removed , and they were .
A small warm mini loaf of dark bread was ok , but was not good enough to tempt us to ask for more .
All in all an average meal and at almost $ 30 was acceptable but certainly not memorable .
No. the style of the restaurant is very modern , you will likely share a table - but not the grill - with many other restaurant goers .
The washroom at this location is again , shared , you will not find this out until you enter it .
Service was not so great .
Not sure i would go back .
It was not busy at all !
No excuse for crappy service and screaming in kitchen that i could hear at front door where i was waiting .
2 orders of tots burnt so badly that i do not even think there was any cheese in them and if so , it did not survive being burned to death .
Was very burned on the outside and it was way too maple -y , but nay be that is how it 's made .. not sure .
Asked for a side of mayo ( 3 times confirmed by glad guy ) l , so of course it was not in the bag when i got home .
My mom asked for extra garlic for her pasta and that was not provided either .
Will not be back ... worst food i have ever had
That was not the case with this rib eye .
I am not used to potatoes being served that way .
The cheese in the potatoes let you know it was there , but did not mask the taste of the perfectly cooked potato .
I did not have to add any extra seasonings .
I do have to say , if the order were doubled , it still would not have been enough .
And the order that came was not small .
My steak was so much i did not taste the lamb .
These were not like that at all .
So , no info about the wines they have .
There was a period of over ten minutes that no one came by our table to give me a refill on my water .
Now our server jade , seemed like she did not really want to be here to work , which i completely understand .
Tee even offered suggestions and items that were not on the menu , for our vegan daughter .
Too bad i had no more room in my car !
.. my guest order the same with a side of broccoli and his portion was smaller ... my tuna was extremely and i asked if that was the norm ... the waitress immediately asked if i wanted to have them prepared again after we noticed my guest portion was not as salty ...
I was not overly impressed and although i just recently moved to the area ...
I will not be in a hurry to return .
When the main courses came out , 2 out of the 7 meals were cold and had to be sent back , one of the meals was not cooked properly and was sent back as well .
To be honest , we were not expecting much out in big box store territory - thought that all would be very plain .
Good menu range , not just the standards .
It 's worth noting that i made our appointments last week and we did not get confirmation phone calls .
We also were not told exactly where they were located and hence wandered up via a back entrance , which was very shady .
I shared this feedback with one of the staff members working at the front desk , but she did not seem to be interested .
So , while the facials themselves were fine , the overall experience was dampened a bit due to the fact that the ladies working up front were not the friendliest or interested in my feedback .
It 's also just as pricey as the local resort spas but the facility does not compare .
It can be a bit confusing because the parking upstairs is not free ... but if you enter the garage from the side of monroe and lawn , it 's the freebie side !
There are times when i can not find a very specific item for a particular recipe , and those times i do sometimes stop somewhere else on the way home to pick up that item .
I have had employees go and check in the back , walk across the store to help me find an item , or run to grab a better item at checkout if i did not notice a bruised apple or something like that .
The prices at tj 's are not lower for every single item , but overall my total grocery bill is lower here than if i shop elsewhere .
I really like the ingredient lists of the food items at tj 's. there are organic foods available , but even for the non-organic items , the ingredients are simple and the list does not go on forever .
No one called .
I have been a regular here for a long time , but i have never wrote a review .
However , if you do not mind the " ok " service , do not let it stop you from trying out their food .
As we left to go pay for our meal , i began looking for my shoes but much to my dismay they were not there .
I am also gon na assume that the person is a girl with pretty small feet , because i do not think a grown ass man would want my shoes .
I am a reasonable person , i was not mean nor accusing because i knew it was obviously not their fault that some idiot took my shoes .
What i was upset about was that no one really tried to help me out !!
I had to wave down the waitress again and explain to them that i have no way of getting home , because no way in heck am i walking barefoot home !
He had no idea what to do with me , mostly just standing around absolutely confused out of his mind .
However , after some consideration we decided we would just pay for our meal anyway since it was not really their fault that my shoes were stolen .
Maybe the fact that they do not speak english all that well may have made the situation more difficult to process , but still there was no reason to just ignore me !
I feel that when something happens to your customer ( no matter how extraordinary the situation ) , it is your responsibility to step up and do something about it .
Just do not leave me standing there and hope i will just leave so that you will not need to deal with the problem , because no , i will not leave .
I left my number with the restaurant just in case you have the conscience to return what is not yours !
If i ever see you on the street , i will not hesitate to ask you about it !
Do not say i did not warn you !
It lost one star because they have not clean up the table next to mine during our mealtime .
Let me tell you , for an all - you - can - eat korean bbq that you cook directly on your table ... not too shabby !
But what a reasonable price to pay and on top of that , they really do not care if you leave items you ordered behind .
I do not have artificial nails , and i have always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day !!!
I do not know what gina does , but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week , and then they do not chip , they merely wear at the tips .
I am not a prolific reviewer , in fact , i rarely do so .
First fork in , not bad !
We are not the type to make a scene , would have been content to slink out of there to the keg across the street , take care of the bill and go .
No so say he !
Now folks , i eat medium , wife does not but i do , i eat sushi , i am no food critic , but i know what is medium and know what rare and blue are , this was raw .
Fine he took the salmon off the bill , offered dessert for the kids , we refused out of fear of something , not sure what , but something !
Went today , a business meeting for lunch , not sure why , but in the area , what the hey , let s give it another try ?
Hey , i am not happy , i pay anyway ( not a bad deal eh ) .
Do not need free food , can buy your place too if you need a hand !
I just want lunch , clean , good , i eat , i pay i leave , no events !
Stem is black , stem is dirty , come on , they did not wash it ?!
Another server comes , picks plate and says : " why you no finish ? "
I say , a little dirty , no problem .
He asks if i wanted him to say anything , i say no , no , i am fine , no problem , need to focus on this meeting here .
Actually it was just ok , not great , but if i were to measure it based upon previous experiences , ya sure , great for grazie .
Sh --t , i told that guy i do not want to make a fuss .
Believe me , there is no agenda , this guy tells me it was the dressing , and it was clean !
This is not his calling !
I should not have waited as long as i did to have lasik done .
I had no complications , although i do recommend that if you have lasik -- listen to everything they tell you to do !
Dry eyes are one of the side effects and i can see how patients that do not listen to the instructions could cause their own complications by not taking care of themselves .
I should not have waited as long as i did -- the results are fantastic !!!
I am not in the habit of writing reviews however , my frustration is huge .
I have never heard back !!!
Decently priced great broth and the spring rolls are fresh , not old like some other places .
The potatoes were too dry and had no flavor or salt whatsoever .
The steak also had no seasoning and was just so blah ... i ordered a cosmo and that was good .
I love my waverly 's as usual daryl has served perfection with service and entree 's that are amazing , would have been 5 stars if the overbearing new manager would not have tried to throw her weight around at the hostess podium and belittle the hostesses work .
It was then i realized we were in a china - a- gogo and not the kauai cafe ......... awkward .
These were not huge but also very tasty .
They also replaced my backwash hose at no cost .
We went on a sunday and was not too busy .
First sign that it was not gon na be good was the locking mechanism attached to front door .
I have never had trouble cutting a boneless wing in half with a fork until this place .
Bbq sauce was good wings were not .
Did not like at all .
Burger meat itself was terrible no flavor .
I do not even have to be going to tj 's for it to make me angry .
Not bad but not great for you .
The food was not the best , especially hash browns and toast .
Although i was not happy i gave a 2 star because i have had worse .
What 's not to like ?
Filling , but no guacamole , so kind of a buzz kill .
The gm was at the front and did not even acknowledge we walked in .
He apologized that he only had one waiter that could not handle the tables .
Not wanting to wait even longer for the food to come out we told him we would try again another day .
We then tried saturday and once again walked in to one server four guests in the whole place and no one at the front .
Once we finally did , i ordered the monte cristo while my friend had the gyros ( not very cajun , i will give you that ! ) we both had sweetened ice tea to drink .
I am not a connoisseur but this is the best deep fried french toast ham & cheese sandwich i have ever had .
Service guy came out and was rude because we had not filled it up so he could see leak ... makes sense except it leaks quickly and we did not know when he 'd be out .
He left in a huff and came back next day ... said it would be expensive and not likely to be covered on warranty .
He gave warranty company a one line report saying it was customer negligence ( not so , but too much info to go into ) ... and that he recommended they not cover it .
You can bet that since we are now paying not only for the warranty visit and his attitude was horrendous that now we will look for a better company to do business with when we pay in full for the repairs !
I see there are a lot of this in the charlotte area , and i can not speak for those , but i loved this place .
It did not , however , come with the bottomless fries offered at red robin .
I also enjoyed an alcoholic beverage since there were no liquor stores in the area .
Be me , 22 m full time student no job thursday hits hit up denny's with the bros for the weekly godly worship server comes around , super friendly , everyone orders food finally server get to me i look around at my friends putting on a strong face nothing wrong ( do not show them how you feel inside )
I 'm not fine inside , it 's 10 pm been studying and going to my hospital clinicals all day no food in my belly no cash in the bank to even feed myself off the 2/4/6/8 menu ( i have bills to pay ) i secretly check my bank apps in hope to find the funds to wave down the server to order some food but it 's over the server brings out the food , funds unavailable for myself i look in horror as my friends stuff their face and i am left hungry another thursday night .
I have been coming here for lunch recently and it does not disappoint .
You will never know . )
Not sure which dish is the culprit .
Will not be back .
The part that caught my attention was when i went to grab the change ( cunningly provided in coins only ) and it looked like i was about to only leave a loonie behind as a tip ( i had not even grabbed all the coins yet ) , not one but two of the waitresses looking on let out a small yelp in the form of a " no " until they realized that was not my intention and they caught themselves .
One 's tip or gratuity should not be expected and any amount should be accepted with at least some humility as a measure of how well you have performed your duties .
Of course there are clients out there that can not be pleased no matter how hard you try , do not believe in tipping , or are otherwise cheap - but there will always be people like that and as this is part of the business and industry , the service industry , and tips again should not be a hard expectation .
I love good food at decent prices and this place surely fits the bill ... but when it comes time to pay the bill , i am not sure i want to deal with the lasting impression of the last impression made by the servers with respect to tipping .
Only issues i have with this spa is that it is quite pricey and does not have full spa amenities such as jacuzzi , steam room , or sauna .
Not so good teriyaki to salty .
I wish i had an option for 2.75 stars because i do love this place but not sure it gets the 3 stars ..... the specials are always ' just fine ' such as beef tips and rice .
I always get the club sandwich when i go here and never can finish it ( it comes with a ton of fries to share ... ) the prices are very reasonable and the staff is super fast and efficient .
Enjoyed their bacon burger lunch special but not so special price .
To explain : waiter did not care , server did not say a word , manager was not pleasant , all disappeared when we asked for assistance .
Salad was over dressed with no flavor cream dressing , the medium well steak was pastey , tasted like bad liver ... etc. talked with the food and beverage manager ... he was pleasant and listened attentively .
No thanks !
We do like the cannery , and victory 's coffee shop is not bad ... but waverley 's is a no go !!!
They do not listen to their messages or call you back when you leave a message .
They serve pepsi products ( i prefer coke ) but that was not enough to dampen my spirits .
Waitress never came back drinks were empty .
We asked for silverware and napkins which no success .
The manager did not even come to our table to apologize .
We were not going to eat there today or in the future .
For some reason this dennys can not get it right .
Wanted to give it no stars but t this app does not allow it
Waverlys never disappoints and always surprises with their attention to detail .
At first i was hesitant but gave it a try since we wanted pho but did not want to kick our diet .
They have a great selection of food that is not run of the mill , for a decent price .
I called him back and said that there was a mistake because the picnic basket was $ 20 . with that , he told me that they had raised their prices but had not changed the prices on the drivethru billboard , and that he would not honor what the price on the board said .
When i asked that he honor the posted price , the said " no , i will just cancel the order . " bad for business to lose a customer over a few dollars , especially when the prices on the board had not been changed .
The menu is not too big , yet it s not too small .
The prices were not too bad either .
I did not get to have any , but it looked really good , and of course will be my first pick when i go back .
We were not planning on coming over here originally .
It turned out that the hours posted in yelp was not accurate , it was not open until 430 pm .
I ordered my favorite gamjatang but did not expect much .
At a time where my soul is not happy , this veggie pho is definite comfort food .. amazing .
This is my second time in and honestly i am not even sure why i came back after my last experience .
This time the food was not even warm / lukewarm .
Not sure if it is just this location or not because i had heard the food at dickeys was good but it seems to me that there is a lack of attention or care here .
Now with my new resolution of not doing so much all - you - can - eat anymore , this place lost it s appeal .
If i do not get the salad , i opt for the special , they are always under $ 8 and it comes with garlic bread and tea .
Have not eaten here too often although it is not far from where i work .
I got the pho ga ( chicken pho ) and the broth had zero flavor which is disappointing because pho is all about the broth , the chicken was cooked well but also had no flavor .
I am not sure if this place is new but they need to reconsider their career because this place and food is not it .
Never mind that you are able to have a free sample of the bread that is made fresh daily .
Do not waste your money or time .
A guy came and took our drink order and did not come back for 10 minutes .
We got our drinks 20 minutes later and had not even ordered our food yet .
We had not even gotten a single drink refill or seen our waitress .
She disappears again comes back with no refills and says to be honest it 's at least another 20 minutes !
My husband talked to another waitress who said not to worry about the drinks .
Will never set foot back in there !
No matter how much you cook it , the taste is still amazing because the sauce is perfect .
1 ) the sea food dishes , they did not really have anything special about them , taste was just ok , it lacks the perfect sauce the meat has and , 2 ) the salads are not worth the price and not tasty at all .
There was only two people in line , and one lady did not have a clue as to what she wanted yet .
I would not recommend based on their service .
Unfortunately i can not remember her name , but there is one waitress who has happened to have our table several times .
There are a couple of other servers who have not left an impression one way or the other , but i have had no negative experiences .
I have no doubt we will continue to choose this location when my parents are in town !
It was nothing more than a few pieces of chicken cheese a couple tomatoes and lettuce that was not fresh .
Will not return .....
I did not like it and i probably will not be back .
I never had to wait more than 5 minutes to check out , even when i would not mind waiting there 's always someone who is ready to get you out .
Though i might not grocery shop here regularly since they do not provide a lot of other items that other grocery stores offer but what they do offer makes me look forward to shopping here .
No major complaints ...
We found that there were just not a lot of options for restaurants open on july 4th but we called dickey 's in scottsdale and found out they were open until 7:00 p.m.
Not hot , lukewarm but cold like it was just taken out of a refrigerator and thrown into a cup .
I will never go back to dickey 's again and i will be sure and tell everyone i know never to go there as well .
I understand the restaurant closed at 7:00 p.m. because of the holiday but they were not closed at 6:20 p.m. the service was also horrible .
As i had 20 minutes to kill waiting for disgusting food , i watched as a patron had to go to the counter not once but twice because first there was no more ice in the soda machine but then when he got his food the employee did not even give him utensils to eat with !!
I do not know who the heck was managing the place but i would say whoever was managing the place should be fired because i saw a lot of unhappy customers and employees who were just waiting for the clock to turn 7 p.m.
Do not go to dickey 's because you will be throwing your money away !
Good did not come out all together , still waiting for other half of our order and what did come out is cold .
Will not ever be back to this dennys .
Service is great here though , no issues here .
This time the $ 17 was not worth it .
I was not expecting this .
This feels like a really fancy restaurant that you 'd be paying 50 + a plate to eat at even if the food is not that fantastic .
I got a steak and it was not any better or worse than most other restaurants so i can not really say come here for the steak but it was exactly what i ordered .
I honestly had no expectations going into this meal other than hopefully a lovely meal with the wife , i was impressed with how nice the place looked ( even if it 's just a facade for the tourists ) the staff were dressed to the nines , the live pianist and the other small touches all made for a surprisingly elegant feeling evening for a price far lower than i expected based of what they were trying to appear to be .
No judgments here .
I am not going to say that i absolutely know what i am talking about when it comes to bbq .
Roadside bbq pits in fl , ga , tn and tx have been some of my favorites that i can not name .
The brisket was so fatty that we did not eat it .
I am fairly certain they just mashed potatoes and added coloring and some red pepper and called it potato salad , there was no flavor to that either .
We will never go back .
Ambiance : nice and not too fancy .
Always appreciate high end spa and red door does not disappoint .
I do not know it is was the canned flavoured non-italian sauce or the weird pepperoni ?
I highly recommend you research your doctor very carefully and do not try to get the best " deal . "
I could never wear contacts on the plane ( i work on an airplane ) because the extremely dry conditions caused too much discomfort and hated wearing my glasses but read hundreds of accounts of botched eye surgeries that kept me from getting it for years .
You do not even have to be an eye doctor .
A suction device is used to keep your eye still ( creates " bruising " on the whites of your eyes that lasts 7 - 10 days ) it 's like a hickey on your eye and it looks awful and painful but it does not hurt at all .
You have to wear these protective glasses 24 / 7 for a number of days ( even in the shower ) and you can not wear eye makeup - i believe for at least a week .
I do not even notice it at all anymore , i am not sure if it has gone away completely , or i have just become used to it .
The only thing that continues to bother me is it 's difficult / not enjoyable to read subtitles of white letters on a black background now so if you are really into foreign movies , it might not be for you .
Also , since you are probably not accustomed to wearing your glasses naked , you may be surprised that your butt is not as cute as you remember it now that you have 20/15 vision :0 ) here are some links to check out : http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/surgeryandlifesupport/lasik/ucm061354.htm
Cheaper cuts of meat , but they are not complaining if you do not eat or grill the fattier pieces .
So big in fact it is not worth it .
Okay no big deal , i buy the new filters and pay the service charge .
Okay another $ 300 , no big deal .
Once we get that fixed your water will run through the filter fine , and you should not have any problems .
I asked the guy if the part was fixed the first time would the other problems have been a problem , " he says no , because the water was not filtering out it was just coming in the filter and going back into the pool , never filtering the pool that is why your pool kept turning green . " they would not listen to my complaint , they only cared about collecting their $ 100 service fee .

Cole slaw is not weighed down too heavily with mayonnaise which is nice .
They have a good beer selection , but no one who knows anything about beer .
They really want to close by 10:00 , so do not plan on sticking around .
While not completely disappointed , i am not totally thrilled with this place either .
The brisket sandwich i had was good , and the meat tender , but there just was not much flavor .
I did not try the sweet .
Unfortunately , i mixed up the cups of original and spicy so i did not know which was which .
And i never found out either .
Do not remember his name , but i we nt back to dine last month , he was still there , skinny asian guy .
The food is decent ... not french , not cajun / creole , but there is decent variety ( as long as you are not a vegetarian .... though the portabella pita is quite good ... )
It 's not a bad place , there are just better spots downtown .
It is not a place i would go to unless i was on a quick one - hour lunch from work .
They do not have draft beers worth mentioning .
Went here last night for a nice dinner with the man & it was not to good .
We waited about a year and a half to come back from getting food poisoning last time & it will unfortunately be the same wait again just cause we did not feel it was worth the time anymore .
So go there for the food but do not do any celebrations at this locations .
I have been here a few times and i have no clue why i keep going because service is absolutely horrible everytime i go .
When i ate there the first time it seems like the waitresses always disappear and never come back .
My husband ordered a beer and he never got it .
Tonight my husband and i ordered takeout 30 minutes before getting there i called in the order when my husband got there it was not ready and he had to wait an additional 30 minutes .... then they made the order for dine in instead of take out .
Then the food ... gross ... nothing had flavor not even my poor piece of salmon ... it was juicy but no flavor .
In all seriousness management needs to evaluate their company cause it 's not just this location and whoever this lady is who comments " sorry this happened " on the other reviews needs to stop and reevaluate her life too .
I love the sauce on the food and can not seem to get enough of it .
Not that i think about .
I can not recall exactly what the meat was .
So the place is not bad .
I have not decided if i like tom 's bbq 's sauce better or not yet .
As you get older and have acquire a taste for real food and not a cafeteria joint .
It became something i rather not eat and just starve .
I do not expect a lot from dennys , unless i m drunk and need food to sober up .
I come here three or more times a month and i am never disappointed .
The same 50 calories and no artificial ingredients .
It did not take long to determine that this bakery would be the answer to my dreams .
Not recommended .
Not much different .
The night trip was also quiet ... not too busy .
The servers have to wait multiple tables .... so not much interaction .
The other thing that provided the " bar " feel at one of the restaurants .... was ordering bottled drinks ( beers and coolers ) and not being offerred a frosted mug or glass .
Should not have to ask ... should have been offered .
Underground parking to not have to walk in the wi weather , yup .
I honestly do not know what you would want that trader joe 's does not have .
I have high hopes but for the price i can not go wrong .
The gentleman over the phone said they were busy , but it should not be too long of a wait for two people .
We did not wait too long , but had received their complimentary bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic in the meantime .
The bread was unfortunately cold and did not taste like it was freshly taken out of the oven , but the restaurant was full so it was to be expected .
She did not particularly enjoy that bit about the capri , but she ate it all !
I feel bad that i can not remember our waitress ' name , but she was so nice .
But i am not really fan of it .
That was so not cool yelp !
Good beer selection , we did not try the food , maybe next time .
Like the other location , grazie does not take reservations , so wait times can vary , fortunately for us it was only a 15 - 20 time wait .
I again told him that i was no longer interested in dining in his restaurant , and he continued to try make me stay .
I will not be back .
The food here was pretty decent other than their complimentary bread service - the bread was rock hard , not warm , and just hard to digest .
We never saw our server but rather he was at other tables that were not even in his section chatting them up .
And personally , i do not like it when they hand you the bill before they even ask if we are ready for it , or before we even ask for it as it comes off as if you are rushing us out of your restaurant especially when it 's not even busy .
Definitely not going back to this location .
I can not stress enough how good their pasta is !
Their bread that they serve is always a downside for me , because it tastes bland and not fresh ** overall i would like coming here if i want a nice plate of pasta , but if you are a person who likes big portions beware this place does not serve big portions of pasta .
My go to sushi place when i want something delicious , and i do not mind waiting for delivery .
There had been times , however , when my delivery person did not bring me any utensils , or a straw , but it 's okay !
And equally especially if it 's just lunch and not busy .
Waitress had to prove to the kitchen that she placed the order correctly by showing them the ticket ( apparently they do not believe their staff . )
I likely will not be back - so many other options .
Opting not to stay , we decided to visit grazie .
He was spectacular .... as many in our group can be a tad demanding on a server , he never lost his cool and was efficient , friendly , outgoing and attentive .
I had the romana pizza ( $ 16 ) - potatoes , rosemary , spicy pancetta , diced tomatoes with cheese ( no tomato sauce ) .
I do not think i 'd order it again as it was lacking something .
No star , if it were an option .
Delayed service , they do not honor what they say to make up for their lack of performance .
A week later , still no call , no show .
Told no way , that they need to honor what they said .
They claimed they installed a new pump , we told them if they really installed a new one , we want the warranty information , which we knew they did not replace with new .
There was no attention to my body 's needs .
She was so worried about telling me about extra charges that she did not focus on what she was doing !
There 's always a line up , however the wait time is not that bad after 7 pm is 10 mins .
The service was good but the food was not worth the money .
The ribeye had no marbeling .
It is on the sweeter side and the size i would say is a small / medium , so it is not enough to share .
Really good food although the service is not that great , some rude servers but overall a good experience .
The rice is not the best and we did not finish it .
The decision was not an easy one and it took a lot of time , with the custom service that he provided it was the right one .
The vision was totally improved better than 20 20 and that was checked by a second independent eye doctor i can not think of anything not to like
I had the same nail technician for both and she just did not seem " into " it ; i could tell she had other stuff on her mind , which she even admitted she was stressed and not all there that day .
That is fine , i understand people have lives outside of work that sometimes interfere , but for a service industry where i am paying $ 40 for a manicure and $ 80 for a pedicure , it would have been nice to receive something as an " i am sorry " i guess to acknowledge that is not how the services always are .
I did not like the pedicure chairs at all .
They are the benches that you sit on so you can not adjust anything for short legs , there is no massage chair , and it was kind of uncomfortable .
While i am happy i got to say i experienced services here , i must say i was quite let down with the experience and will probably not be returning .
The one plus of the trip was the nail polish - i have developed a new love for essie polish that i may not have had otherwise !
I can not imagine that i am the only one that has had this issue , so if i do not get approached in some way to make the situation right , i will probably be filing a complaint with the state .
Literally did not even last 1 use .
I also do not appreciate the snarky and passive aggressive comment on this review from whoever mike is .
They did not even replace the 15 year old handle just the base which is half a$$ and shoddy work .
I do not care what the policy of my home warranty is .
It 's not the hw companies fault that they do not take pride in what they do .
Do not bother with this company , i anticipate they will be out of business within the year anyway .
We went early evening on a saturday and even then there was a 15 minute wait which is fine ... tells us the place can not be that bad .
The lobster was overdone and a bit chewy , but since this was her first time with lobster and she did not seem to care for the taste , i did not send it back .
My wife had the chicken and filet and she liked it but did not care for the mesquite taste the chicken had .
That was not outback 's issue , since it was wood fired lol !
The manager came by for a visit and i pointed this out and she agreed that this was definitely not medium rare and offered to get me another which was nice , but i chose to keep it and not make the rest of the family wait for me .
If you bill yourself as a steak house , like outback does , you should never , ever serve an improper steak .
I just do not get that .
I do not mind paying up to 6 dollars for a loaf of bread if i love it and that i do with this little bundle of carbs .
( good carbs though ! promise ! ) as soon as you walk in they offer you a slice ( more like a chunk , but i am not complaining ! ) of one of their breads offered that day .
I have never had any of their sandwiches made in shop , but i can only imagine the love i would have for them .
Like whole slices of bread , not mini little bites .
I do not eat a lot of bread so when i do , i want it to be worth it !
And i can not say enough about the hot , fresh , brown bread - in fact , that 's what usually makes me want to come in .
Keven is not a huge chocolate fan , and i thought he was gon na start fighting me over the desert ( not really , he 's a super generous sweetie ! )
Not much to say .
Went for dinner here since buffalo wild wings had a long wait and we did not have enough time .
Since my boyfriend had work we did not order adult beverages just a water with lemon and pepsi / coke .
The drinks come out , surprise no lemon .
( we stated lemon with the water , so it was not like an un- spoken request ) whatever , we decided it was not worth a fight and went to ordering our dinner .
Once we placed our order , we did not see our waitress once until after the food came out .
My salad did not come out prior instead it came with , and was terrible .
We never saw our server again , until she dropped off the bill .
So instead of complaining we paid and left and i do not plan on returning to this location .
I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone , and do not see how people are raving about it .
Just when i thought i could not feel any fatter , i went to eat at the korean grill house .
We did not return the fish because we were under tight time constraints since we would be seeing a show immediately following .
It s pretty much rice ( that 's not cooked all the way ) , embryo shrimp ( of the frozen kind from your local grocer ) , and red spicy sauce ( umm , creole sauce ? ) .
I have never seen chicken with so much fat .
I go at least 2 - 3 times a month do not miss out ask for darrel !
Here is my experience thus far , i would prefer not to rate with stars & just disclose the facts .
Fee does not include 3 types of eye drops @ $ 140 , fish oil etc . ) .
Still can not see .
Still can not see . * 3rd apt. i still can not see .
Still can not see . * 3rd apt. i still can not see .
Not safe & i am hoping to find a resolution to get back to life .
What kind , i do not know exactly , but it was tasty and we should have purchased more .
No one ever checked on me the whole time .
I will not be back .
I hope you will not go there either .
The food ... not bad , but bland and small .
Have never had a bad meal here .
Do not be thrown off by the name of the place as it s definitely not french !
Basically , it 's an american bistro / greek menu but the price is right and you can not go wrong w the timing and the service .
Pros- ( only one ) tech showed up on time fri 9 am cons - tech figured out the problem , said he was going to the parts store to get a new motor , did not hear from him for 5 hours , so i called him at 3 to get an update on how he was doing , he told me he had gone to another job and it took him longer than what he thought and now parts store was closed and he would not be able to fix my motor until the following week ?
Would not explain why he had gone to another job before completing mine .
Tech showed up saturday morning , and unloads the motor , it does not look brand new , i asked him , is it new and and he said no , it 's rebuilt ???
At this point , i just wanted to have my pool fixed as it was turning green , and said fine , let 's just get it going , i called the office tuesday morning . ( memorial day ) some how they tried to make it as it was my fault that i got rebuilt motor , not the new one that we agreed , " i should have said something " , i was told .
I will forward my complaint to my warranty company not to ever send aaron pools to do warranty work to my house
Will not be back .
I can not wait to go back because the food is yummy !
The prime rib had no salt crust .
Almost no flavor .
Fried rice was pasty obviously over cooked and shush had no flavor .
I am not sure about the other services .
Black angus is not much better with their service , but it is down the road , as well as other places around the mall for steak .
The cut was a big change for me and i could not be happier .
Do not be scared off by the cannery ... this is indeed a darn good steak house in a very mediocre casino .
What makes cannery even extra special is that prices are not nearly what s charged for similar food out on the strip .
This place just did not do it for me .
I could say more , but i am not out to bash any staffers .
The food was just eh. sorry guys .. will not be back .
It was about $ 20 a person which is pretty standard for ayce bbq so do not let the $ $ rating of this restaurant scare you .
My first complaint about this place is that they would not accept debit card but they still took credit cards for some reason ...
I do not know if it was just because their machine was down for the day or what but it was very frustrating for me and my friends .
I feel that if they are not willing to give as much as the customers want , then they really should not be offering an ayce option because it gets frustrating .
I could never recommend this company .
Whatever not worth mentioning .
But i no longer care for them since a former roommate of mine had an " unwelcoming " visit with them .
It was a vibe that could not easily be shaken nor dismissed .
You can not be intolerant .
This place is terrible and i have not even gotten to the food .
I no longer live in madison ( * sad * ) , and their are a ton of things i miss about that place ( the terrace , genna's , my roommates , saturday morning tailgating , the smell of madison in the fall , etc. ) and surprisingly one of the things i miss the most is trader joe 's .
Also , i do not know any other grocery store that will give you a free sample of bacon wrapped scallop 's !!!!
I can not wait til i live by you again :)
The banchan is a good variety and i have never had an issue getting refills .
I have never had the kbbq here but i really want to get some friends together and go at it .
I could not be happier .
I can not believe that people would complain about the wait time for their visit .
Crowded as usual which is fine ... used to that but got dark meat instead of what i had requested and potatoes were not great ... felt like someone new is in the kitchen .
Maybe it was an off day ... sadly i can not make it there often so was disconcerting .
Not memorable bbq , but i do not remember it being terrible by any means .
The chicken was tender but so saturated or marinated in salt salt saltyyyyy we could not even eat more than one bite ... and that was without any bbq sauce on it .
We are not goats !
Never going back here ever again .
I have never had an issue with the staff .
I have also never really asked them any questions or needed help .
I do not usually leave bad reviews and i am a big fan of korean food but i hate everything about this place !
I do not get the hype about this chain of ' korean ' restaurants that are actually run by chinese !
Bbq sirloin beef with lettuce wrap and rice $ 40 came with a tofu soup and a bunch of side dishes all pretty good the beef was not really fresh as i have seen in other places the cuts of meat were frozen and many pieces were frozen together a super filling meal for two people and it probably would have fed three
I do not know why this place got such mediocre reviews ?!
Omg ... i do not know what they did but it was disgusting .
Eggs were not a lot better .
I would not be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life .
Can not say they were bad .
For the price , denny 's burger was definitely not worth it .
I do not care if it 's free on your birthday , it 's not worth it .
Do not come here .
We had two broken valves and the light was not functioning .
Daniel was not personable at all .
He looked at the valves and said they would not be covered because they went to the water features .
I could not find where it had said anywhere in my contract that water features were not covered .
He was matter of fact and very cold about the fact they were not covered .
Again , without any remorse , he said it was not a covered item either .
My husband pulled the light out and it was not full of water !
I have never felt so ripped off by daniels diagnosis and estimate for the repair of the pool light .
Not a chance .
He insisted that it be printed , not scanned from the phone .
I have absolutely no idea what the manager and owner do ( except reject coupons from customers ) .
I did not try the food , but looking at the other ratings , may it was an omen that we ended up having a great meal across the street at butterfield 's .
I can not answer that one .
They have a ton of different pastas on the menu - i have tried about 5 diff ones now and liked them all - i am never disappointed when i eat there .
I hear the location at yonge & eg always has a line - up - the vaughan location is the same menu and i have never had to wait !
I left a message , but no one ever called me back .
I guess wvi does not want my money !
If this place can not even manage it s appointment scheduling properly , why would i trust my eyes to them ?
The food is decent at best but i am not really a fan of their pizza .
I do not know how they make it but the crust seems far too thick and tough ( overdone ? ) to be anywhere near authentic neapolitan .
The flavor and presentation are ok but the serving size was sort of small and it was not anything that blew me away .
The dining area is nice but as far as italian food goes this is by no means the best there out there but it 's not bad .
The atmosphere was the typical italian restaurant around the vaughan mills area , sterile and not much character .
The fried pickles were delicious and that 's not the booze talking .
Adding insult to injury , no one told us that there was complimentary ice cream for customers - we discovered that as we were leaving ( for the first and last time i might add ) !
This tells me they simply do not know how to handle food , which is worse than than back quality meat , it 's dangerous .
I had a couple of discount cards and simple threw them away and will never go back .
I also appreciated the macaroni salad that was not caked in mayo .
Not a bad place for korean food .
Never had to wait for more than 2 minutes for anything we asked for .
I would not say it was anything crazy special , but you will enjoy your meal .
Porkbelly was not overly fat and as i said before , the refills on lettuce was spot on so we were never waiting for more lettuce as the food was cooking .
The only thing is that they do not allow you to grill the jalapenos on the hot grill .
Not a big issue , but it was different i suppose .
The smell is very strong here since the place is kind of small and ventilation ( i assume via jalapenos remark ) is not the best .
As another yelper said , do not be alarmed that this establishment is in a casino , it is worth the trip there .
No. but the worst loser of a product will not set you back much here , and once you know what you like it 's usually there .
The only thing i do not care for is the amount of packaging , especially on the produce .
It 's mostly not even recyclable here .
Okay , also there have been some not - quite - fresh bakery items .
We did not order apps , for we do not normally eat large portions so we we nt straight to the main course and both ordered 8 oz filets , mine medium rare and hub straight medium .
We both had mashed potatoes that were not saturated with butter .
Wait time as far as i am concerned is acceptable , because no one is rushed .
We can not wait for this ordeal to be done , however , we will recommend this office without any hesitation .
And , crab soup so salty , was not edible .
The waitress , who was really good , did not charge for it after complaining .
Will not be going there again .
Waited for 20 mins to get a table no problem grabbed a drink by the bar and we chatted with the friendly bartender .
Very quiet , lots of tables but there was no one else there .
The tables are so close together , they never used to be so close .
If u want a romantic setting , forget it . not a place for an intimate dinner and very loud . an honest review
It 's certainly not the best of the best bit it 's solid .
She was trying to sell me one of their more expensive pedicures the whole time , and when i said no she commented that it was probably that i could not afford it because of my work place .
Never will i go to this sleazy spa ever again .
I went for the hot link sandwich first and did not put any hot bbq sauce on it so that i could taste the natural spiciness of the hot link ..... well , i was disappointed , it 's not very hot at all .
I went for the hot link sandwich first and did not put any hot bbq sauce on it so that i could taste the natural spiciness of the hot link ..... well , i was disappointed , it 's not very hot at all .
It 's not a bad sandwich ..... pretty good .
Could add $ 3 extra for veggies , but we did not .
The wait staff was also very slow and do not refill water at all .
We will not be going back .
The flavors caught me off guard but it was not bad .
I kid you not , they have the nicest staff ever ; not a single person there is rude at all .
I did not decide right then and there if i wanted to get it done so i we nt home , contemplated about it , and called them that same day to let them know i wanted to go ahead and get lasik done .
The appointment before surgery and the day of , it takes 2 - 3 hours but it goes by fast so do not worry ( just make sure you do not have anyone waiting for you so they do not complain about the " long wait " ) .
I now see 20 / 20 , i do not have to spend so much money on contacts anymore , and i can wear sunglasses without having to put it over my eyeglasses lol .
After coming here for dinner last friday , i can confirm that the original chef does not make the dishes here .
We also ordered the fatty pork lettuce wrap ( not sure what the korean name is ) - the pork was sliced thinner than other places and not fatty enough ( according to my korean friends ) .
To sum it up , the meat was not juicy at all and the dish would have been very dry if not for the kimchi .
There 's no back support , so my back was aching by the time we finished dinner .
I do not know how everyone else is doing it .
Be prepared to line up , but i would not waste my time .
You can not go wrong with the pho special , which is what i got , but if you do not like tripe or tendon ( a texture thing -- personally i am a fan ) you may want to get the pho tai or one of the other options .
Sadly , i went vegetarian so no more kbbq for me .
Oh do not order the fish to grill ... it was such a pain to get out .. almost burnt it
I do not go there too often because i try to keep my trips down - and usually prefer woodmans , willy , metcalfe 's , or jenny street .
He fixed the issue in no time .
The relaxing features that were supposed to be incorporated into the massage were not - eye mask , hot towels , etc.
They actually sell jars of the moisturizer at the hostess station but i could not justify spending $ 25 dollars for it .
I went to get a second consult at lasik of nevada . i did not feel as comfortable plus i waited in the waiting room for quite a while .
Anyways i had my surgery done a couple weeks ago and i could not be happier !!!
Some places may tell you he is retired and he will not perform the surgery but he does .
- bright and fun atmosphere - they have little shopping carts for kids - good prices on oils ( especially coconut and olive ) - 2 buck chuck - nice ( and affordable ) selection of cheeses - lemon turnovers despite this , i think trader joe 's is very overrated because : - poor selection of " basics " ; what i mean is that if i have a recipe in hand and go to trader joe 's , it is likely that i will not be able to find every ingredient - too much pre-packaged and heavily processed foods - it 's small and hard to navigate when crowded - produce is sometimes of questionable quality - i do not love their cereals all - in - all , trader joe 's is ok , but there are better places to go .
No wait time , easy to schedule
The first thing i noticed , no welcome when entering .. it 's a small thing , but the extra touch that i am used to at other locations ( the store did a a few people , but not by any means crowded ) .
I paused the bread slices awaiting my turn , the young lady we nt back behind the counter , no comment , no offer of bread .
It was my turn so i went to order ; no smiles or kindness from the young lady ringing .
I asked a question , and with a roll of the eye , was told they did not have the item i requested .
I ordered the sandwich , she rang order & pushed the receipt to me across the counter ( not for signature , but my copy .
The young lady who brought my sandwich , no smile , appeared irritated as well .
Perhaps an off day , perhaps selective with niceties , i do not know , but the staff did not make a good impression to me at this location .
When i walked in and nobody was at the register and several employees just passed by me and did not say anything .
This place was not clean at all and my coffee cup had stains on the inside .
Will not be going back there
I almost got into an all out brawl with a staffer who tried ( hard i might add ) to convince me they have never sold lavender laundry detergent .
I did not see , and because i know things sometimes come and go , i asked about it , and i was met with such resistance and hostility ... seemed very out of place for tjs .
Not certain if it was just a rough day for them or if i was putting out something that just was not being picked up .
The pumpkin spice is one of my all time favorites and i have never had a better cinnamon roll !!
However , i have gone the past 2 saturday 's around 8 am ( bare in mind they open at 6 ) only to be told they have no fresh bread ( or any bread really for that matter ) and would not get a shipment in until 10 or 11 !!!
Never a bad experience and always love the food .
They are not too heavy for what they are and the sweetness level is perfect .
If you do decide to indulge in this amazing experience yourself , renee is a true gem and she will not disappoint with the amazing work that she does !
They were not tender at all .
The kalua pig & cabbage was tasteless ; i am not the type of person who puts salt on my meals , but i doused this dish with soy sauce to try to give it some flavor .
No joke .
Was not happy with the food overall , but they do have good macaroni salad .
It was our first time and we did not know what to order .
Would not give it to my dog .
We did not order any sushi or rolls - maybe they can do these well .
My visit today just confirmed why we do not frequent this restaurant .
Food was decent ( not worth a $ 35 check ) but service was horrible .
There were maybe 8 tables including people sitting at the bar so obviously not busy .
Which was okay until our server brought out our food and never returned .
We needed drink refills and extra napkins but could not ask our server .
Our server brought the check , came back a minute later to collect but it was not ready yet .
She never returned .
I do not see what people complain about here .
Poorest environment ever **** so my boyfriend asked me to hv korean bbq ..... the food was okay but do not expect to have a very nice environment there .
Trader joe 's is hands down my favorite place to shop for groceries and this one is no exception .
Will order again but will ensure the do not take too long for delivery !
I have been here twice for lunch and i do not think i have had a more filling $ 10 sit down lunch anywhere else .
The service could be a little bit better but i would not classify it as being horrible .
Would not get the again .
No sweet or heat .
I lost my jewelry in their spa and i we nt back to look for but people do not care about it and their attitude is really bad .
I am a chinese so maybe they think i am not native and they just do not care about me , i called the police and try to reach their manager , they told me they can not give me manager 's phone number because it is privacy and their manager is on vacation , bullshit privacy they are bunch of racist !
Not a bad price for bbq , i figured .
Not a bad price , that is , if it 's good bbq ...
This was not good .
Second , the meats did not have a good , bbq 'd taste , they were plain and frankly , the brisket was kind of gross .
Fourth , they only had one size drink , this mammoth 32 - oz yellow cup made of hard plastic .. not very enviro .
As we were being seated by the host , the waitress loudly said " are we still serving food ? " hint number one that she clearly did not want to be there .
It was my first time here and i was looking forward to trying the food , but sadly , she ruined it for me and i probably will not be back , horrible .
How can you not love this bar ???!!!
I ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to elizabeth arden again .
I will not shop around again !!
Having never been to a hickory tavern before but having been to hickory , nc let 's just say i did not have big expectations .
Yes i know they are not related but that 's what happens when you name yourself after what i would refer to as an oasis of parking space .
They all looked similar to me and i asked around the table and no one could remember what our waitress looked like either .
But i do not know about how i feel about coming back here for horribly slow service even if the food is ridiculously cheap .
The service was good and friendly , the food however was not .
The crab soup was not the best , but the service was fast and on point .
If it is was not for the haboob , the girls that came to visit sickie me would have eaten in the east side .
Hopefully , no more pool issues , but should one arise , i look forward to working with them again in the future .
And because our waiter gives us looks when we do not order wine :) they balk at menu changes but if you smile , they will do it for you .
I did not try the sausage or brisket , so can not comment on that .
Not as good as dave 's famous bbq or texas roadhouse , but still very decent .
I liked the place but i will never go back if i can not drink as much as i 'd like .
They must have not liked the hundreds of dollars we 'd already spent and must not have wanted the hundreds of dollars we 'd have likely continued to spend , i guess .
I assure you , we were all adults and were not fall down drunk or disruptive .
Do not go here for lunch .
At this point i was not mad but what happened next is what put me over .
This all occurred during the lunch hour -- they were not busy at all .
I do not understand why they could not have set my container aside for a few minutes to make sure i did not return for it .
Not to mention , trader joes has some of thee best groceries anyone could buy .
I understand that it s a trader joes thing to not appeal to customers as some giant corporation or whatever , so they make their store parking lots micro sized , making any and all persons who try and find a spot have a panic attack all because they want to get some soy milk and bananas .
I can imagine this is probably because of people parking there for extended periods of time that are not customers , but good god , people make it two hour parking so people have a chance to park freely and if they overstay their parking time , then ticket them .
So , if you want great food and excellent service please support trader joes , but do not expect that you will be free of paying for parking , getting a ticket , or having a small fit while trying to find a place to park .
I would have like to try a bite but sadly , there were no remains .
I would not order them next time .
I am not sure what kind of glaze they add .
I have not seen the inside yet but i am familiar with the small location in a little strip mall in front of smith 's .
I do not mind a wait if quality results are produced .
( they did not put a sauce in the bag for the second sandwich but i had enough left over ) .
The first time i was not overly impressed , but we decided to give it another chance .
Well , the menu should not say boneless wings then .
I tried the tenders , but it just was not good so i sent it back and got a burger .
The server was rude about me sending it back and a manager never came to check on our table .
A table sent food back and a manager just did not care .
The hosts did not want to actually sit us , pushed us to the bar seating which is first come first serve .
My friends and i will definitely not be returning to this location and will certainly drive another 3 minutes down the road to go to buffalo wild wings for a sports bar and real boneless wings in the future .
This is mind blowing for me especially when i started out from a pair of glasses with a prescription of - 10 , and can not remember when i was able to see without contacts or glasses .
He can help you determine what is best for you and he is not afraid to tell you that you are not a candidate .
They obviously do not care about customer service .
Do not give them your business !
But i found their ventilation is not good enough for korean bbq .
Have not been here in a while , but we used to eat here every other month .
We saw several booths empty and were not cleaned off .
She should not have to do this ... it did seem a little under staffed ... i am just sorry we did nt see our favorite waitresses ... this denny 's use to be busy no matter what time it was , but this time it was empty around especially at lunch time ... please look at your reviews and fix some things
Never was i shown the facility or walked through the spa , my daughter was with me having mother daughter time she is 17 years old .
The lady at the entry to the spa was not helpful at all .
I simply did not complain but this type of treatment by your staff immediately set the ambience for the remainder of our stay which was short lived because after she handed me my drink she proceeds to ask me my daughters age ?
Then proceeds to tell me that they do not allow underage in the spa !
I read on the sign by the jacuzzi no children under 16 .
So either she was just being plain mean and cruel and very unkind to a guest with her daughter and in my opinion should not be working in an elizabeth arden spa environment or they failed to tell me that when i booked our spa services .
I would not recommend this spa in litchfield park @ the wigwam .
The sauce they gave us was gluten free but i do not think they had a gluten free kitchen ( and they were not pretending too ) .
I have not even tried the food , but there is no excuse for poor customer service .
But do not let this fool you , majority of kauai cafe 's patrons come in during breakfast and the lunch rush , and from what i hear keep the place busy .
But i was not that hungry !
The wifey had their much talked about heineken beer batter fried chicken , and she was not sorry .
I had a bite and almost did not stop .
Seeing that we live kind of far away from this restaurant , i do not think i could make the drive there on a weekly basis .
From the first consultation i had with rebecca to the pre-op exams i had with bernie & mccandless , even the front desk ladies - every single member of the wellish team that i encountered were such a comfort to talk to , i truly was made to feel like i was a valued patient every step of the way & most importantly : never pressured !
I highly recommend ! btw this lasik procedure pays for itself in 10 yrs it s what i would have spent on contacts alone , not to mention the elation of visual freedom !!
What i can not handle , however , is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service .
I not only will not be back , but i will make sure to provide any friends , business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they are actually wanted .
One look at my pictures will tell you i am not from hawaii .
But i like the beach and i 'd jump at the chance to get with a hawaiian m -- oh. tmi. point being , hawaiian culture fascinates me , and even though i have not been ( yet ) i find hawaiians ( and pac islanders ) to be attractive not just in looks , but in personalities and in their cuisine !
He chatted with us for quite a bit , telling us about kauai , which i found fascinating as emijandro has been , but i never have .
He talked about the experience of moving from hawaii to las vegas , and the fact that like every other person that moves here , he never really suffered from allergies until hitting the 702 .
Had not been to an outback restaurant in years so decided to give it a try .
My son ordered a kids burger and the bun was so hard he could not eat it .
Can not go wrong with that .
I would rate higher if i ate , but i was not hungry and can not rate the food without trying it .
Although it 's not my main grocery store , i pop in to tj 's at least once a week as it 's within a stone 's throw of my workplace .
It 's always a nice little respite , with everyone always being extremely friendly and helpful and of course i do not mind the ever- present sampling area .
But usually i grab a bag of beet chips and / or dark chocolate peanut butter cups for a delicious , not too unhealthy pick - me - up treat that does not break the bank .
They may not be organic , but the ingredients are basic and healthy - ish without chemical additives and artificial colors , etc. at christmas time , they are one stop shopping for amazingly low priced seasonal greenery -- wreaths and poinsettias and anything else you need or want to make a festive holiday home .
The only reason i do not give trader joe 's five stars is that they do not typically offer organic fruits and vegetables per piece , as they do with their conventional produce .
I would like to enjoy an even healthier snack like an orange or banana , but i am not down with chemical agriculture .
You do not feel super guilty when it 's only 2 - 3 bites of a dessert .
I just learned about their return policy for food that you do not quite like .
You can return items if you find that they were not to your liking .
That 's kind of a cool concept that you will probably not get at other stores .
I hope others do not abuse that policy and ruin it for those that may need it .
Obviously i did not go back , but i called and spoke to the manager .
I was told that there is no such list .
Her voice is calming and she moves gracefully around so as not to disturb your serenity .
When it 's not 150 degrees outside i enjoy a nice bowl of pho meatball .
The service was good but do not be fooled they are obviously trained on getting you in and out here during the lunch hour .
Least favorite things : chaotic parking lot ( the top lot is metered and underground parking is free but cramped , usually bike there though so do not have to deal with this ) , the packaging on the produce - so wasteful .
The prices are great for the quality of food , i do not do all my shopping there but there are items that i come just to tj 's to get .
Do not trust you vision to anyone else .
I still have to remind myself at night that i do not have to take my contact out ...... i do not wear them any more !
I still have to remind myself at night that i do not have to take my contact out ...... i do not wear them any more !
It added a level of complexity that i have never had from any other hawaiian joint .
Only problem was they do not provide enough tartar sauce .
Not only is it big , but that thing tastes onolicious !!
Does not even come close to kauai cafe .
The desert that followed was as amazing as the rest of the entire meal although at this point i was full and could not enjoy the entire thing .
We were told they had no sourdough bread , so we both subbed for honey wheat .
After 10 minutes , we still did not have my friend 's sandwich ( same exact one ) .
Another 10 minutes passed and no one really looked like they were doing anything .
Only a few minutes after that the sandwich came out ( with sourdough bread ) , with no reference to the fact that it took almost 25 minutes longer to make that one .
It was the same girl who works the register , so i can not imagine it 's hygienic to handle money and then handle anything without gloves .
When i went up to ask for the manager the girl simply asked , " do you want a cookie or something , or do you want me to comp your meal ? " but still no apology , and did not even ask for feedback .
I thought that " stuff happens " or " do not be overly critical " , but then mine was bad as well .
The waiter even told the other table " well , i do not grow the cows .
Some are more stubborn than others . " probably will never return to this restaurant .
So you encounter a lot of different staff in the process , and i really do not have anything bad to say about any of them .
The surgery itself was unpleasant , but it is quick enough and the results come fast enough that i would not hesitate to do it again .
Wellish talked to me throughout the surgery and i was not just left in silence wondering what was going to happen next .
It 's not jump up and down good , but can definitely satisfy a pasta craving .
Service is not the fastest but i am generally in no hurry so it 's fine by me .
Been here so many times but have not got time to write them a decent review , so here it is !
But trust me , their bbq will not let you down .
Do not let the $ 40 - $ 45 / dish ( table cooking on the menu ) shock you because the portion is very decent and generous !
Remember to ask for lettuce and sauce because normally they will not serve you like other korean bbq restaurants .
Do not even get me started on their side dishes .
The service is hit and miss but i am not blaming them .
Ok np , by then we were already blech so it was kind of a " that figures " moment , so did not make a tiff just asked it be taken off the check .
I barely ate half and if u knew me ud know i never only eat half my fries , even when they are not great .
Which was not her fault , not really sure what happened in the kitchen tonight though .
Just wish it was under better circumstances ( no i am not driving ) .
He turned it on for 10 seconds and said sounds like the bearings are not working but the home warranty wo nt cover noise issues .
I kept trying to tell him that it was not working how it was supposed to and it was causing the water to be cloudy , and not sucking how it was supposed to .
He said it s not cloudy .
He did not want to work , then gave me a quote for a new pump .
I called my home warranty company old republic , and they said they would have covered the barrings and the tech does not call the shots on what is covered and what is not .
I have had old republic for years at my other house with a pool and never had an issue with coverage .
Not sure how you could figure things out in 10 seconds , run from this company , kid did not want to work or because i am female he thought he could get one over one me .
I am 4 months pregnant and take medication that i can not drink with ( pregnant or not ) so i decided to have a non-alcohol daiquiri .
He did not taste anything .
I began drinking it and after about 5 sips i began feeling something is not right with the drink and felt a buzz .
I asked for management to confirm there was no alcohol in my beverage .
The phone call i received the next day and today was a very uncaring about my pregnancy and about the medication that i take and basically said we comped your meal that 's all we are doing because you were not injured and gave you free coupons .
I told them a free meal write off does not compensate for a negligent mistake .
Very loud for not having that bar / club type of atmosphere .
Ridiculously - as in , an embarrassment of riches , not saccharine or insincere - friendly staff , many of whom we are on a first name basis with .
The half pound burgers are not half a pound .
The fries were not good .
I guess the microwave was not working very well .
They did not have 2 out of the 3 soups featured on the menu .
Our server did not serve us .
I have hung out here at the bar before and it was great but whatever you do , do not eat here .
It 's not something they really care about .
Anyone who says the food is good here does not get out much .
My expectations were not high because it 's bar food but do not waste your time or money eating here .
You suck at food - you can not even do bar food well .
I have never had a better pulled pork sandwich ever .
This place is tucked away , so most of the time it is not busy .
The staff are pleasant and helpful , just remember to look at what bread is offered each day , as not all breads are offered each day throughout the week .
The restaurant was not crowded , everything was clean , and everyone walked away from dinner full and happy .
Try it you will not be disappointed if you do .
I wish i could go more often but i do not work downtown .
Do not go here !!
Kind of attitude which we have dealt with but after this last time the attitude and the fact she would n't give more than 4 soy sauces pushed my buttons .
I wanted four more but nope could not be done .
My 2 yr old was with me do i did not want to create a huge scene .
We only come here because it 's a convenient location but we will not be returning .
I 'd give zero stars but it will not let me .
This place is definitely not your typical l&l hawaiian or aloha kitchen type of place .
I did not know what everything was ( only some of it ) but i was already impressed .
I had something in a broth like stewed collar greens sorta thing ( very yummy ) , some shredded chicken in a soup with small noodles ( very yummy ) tuna poki ( incredibly yummy ) salmon with tomatoes ( forgot the name of it , sorry ) my main entree had some lau lau ( which was incredible and not the least bit dry at all ) there was also kaluah pork ( again sorry for the spelling ) .
I have no idea why i have not tried this place sooner .
So , i told him i could not wait another " few hours " for him .
I would still like to know why he was leaving with my plumbing - he could not figure out that he needed to buy some 1.5 inch pvc and a coupler ?
I do not have anything bad to say about any of the flavors .
Being a kauai boy growing up then relocating to oahu for a good 7 years and now in vegas , i saw this in the kama'aina magazine and was like no sh*t lol i had to try this place .
There is choke parking so no worries on that .
Not hard to find either .
The girl at the register did not speak to us she dropped our plates on the table and when we told of the bad tea she said " oh well we are closed anyway " .
I do not know if i would call that a bargin .
( the burger was fine but not 10 dollars fine ) during the summer months when its warmer ( who am i kidding , it s charlotte , it may be 80 mid dec ) they have a few tables posted up outside where you can sit and eat , sit and eat and watch other patrons from several other food places walk past , or sit and eat and people watch or be watched ...
If you can not really afford to go to a high end , food snob , steak house and you are craving a steak , where do you go ?
I had not eaten all day so i was hungry .
We mentioned t to the server who although very nice , spoke to us like we have never had the dish before .
We could not taste anything but pepper !
The torino was too el dente ( again more then usual ) and the bottom of the pizza was burnt , and the kids did not finish it bc of the aftertaste .
I am so happy right now i can not even put it into words .
Do not think i will return .
- roasted garlic pasta sauce - puts other pasta sauces to shame , tastes super garlic -y but not in the stinky breath kind of way - chicken tikka masala frozen dinner - i love to cook so i do not do frozen dinners too often , but this one is sooo good .
A little disappointed when i purchased the white chocolate cherry bread yesterday , it only had a few white chocolate chips and not a lot of cherries either .
The chicken was flavorless and the sauce was not spicy and very mild in flavor .
I would never order the teriyaki chicken again from this place .
Can not be $ 4 sandwiches .
Before the surgery without my glasses i could see up close but not at a distance .
Now i can see at a distance and not up close .
The monovision path was supposed to help this and it just did not you do not realize how convenient glasses are until you ca nt put on a set to see all around you .
The other was that the visits where with very nice and good people who kept telling me my eyes were good , and everything was great , when i could not really see well in the first couple of feet .
My suggestion is , if you can see ok at all ranges with glasses on , do not do this because the only place your vision can go from good is down , and every time you look at your phone you just get frustrated that you spent thousands to be inconvenienced more than when you started .
Just be careful , and know that the low statistics for eye problems are not representative , and there is a much higher dissatisfaction rate that the stats do not count .
My opinion of outback has not really changed .
My visiting is not very frequent now so i do not know if that 's still true .
Not outstanding , but solidly good .
An ok place to go in a pinch , but i do not think it will ever be a destination we plan on .
The place has the feel of a frat bar , but it 's not .
The main waitress ( i do not know her name unfortunately ) went out of her way to offer us hot tea with ginger .
You can tell not only does she care about her business but also the customers .
It 's bit small so fills up pretty quickly but it does not seem overcrowded because the tables are spaced nicely .
Do not use this company !
The guy that services my pool weekly ( not from aaron pools ) tells me when my pool equipment is not working properly , so i can contact my warranty company and see if the repair will be covered .
When my pool tech told me a i needed a new dome lid , i contacted old republic and the representative informed me she did not think it would be covered , but told me i should contact aaron pools and ask them .
She verified that it would not be covered , so i asked how much they would charge me if i had them come do it without involving the warranty company at all .
When the aaron pools tech showed up the next day , he was an hour early , so i was not even home .
After he completed the work , he said the cost was $ 150 , but that he did not have an invoice on him .
I have learned my lesson ... do n't trust anyone !
The food is typical bar / pub fare , nothing i would really consider to be associated with the real french quarter but what we ordered was good food but nothing you could not find any any other neighborhood pub .
But the prices are very affordable here , even for the drinks are affordable and they do not try to be pretentious here like many other places uptown .
It does not feel heavy for a creamy dish .
Would have given them 4 stars if we did not order the poke .
They give a pretty good amount for the price , but it was not fresh at all .
Really disappointing , because we wanted to try something different from the major chain sub shops . however , i could not even eat my roast beef sandwich .
Bread was dry and broke apart , so i was left with a gross , fatty pile of meat and no bread .
Sorry to say but will not be back .
I have so many friends that love this chain , but i am not a fan .
Took forever to get drinks , asked for pancakes out first and never came .
Never received an apology and were asked to pay full price .
Never coming here again !
I have always ordered from the kbbq section of the menu , never actually ordered anything else .
They actually called me up and scolded me for not cleaning my pool .
We left it there to see how long it would take them to remove it and they never did .
Our pool never looked so bad as while they were servicing it .
Each tech had different things they did / did not do .
Onto the taste , my loco moco tasted dry , the patty was over cooked , there was not enough gravy to counter the dryness between the patty and rice .
The egg came over easy , but i usually prefer sunny side , not sure if you can have them change it or not ( but it does not hurt to ask ) .
I honestly have not found a place here in las vegas that could top it back in oahu ( zippy 's anyone ? ) .
The spam musubi came with mayo in it , which to us was weird as we do not usually see that , but it was still good .
The overall experience was okay , i will not be going out of my way to come here though .
This is not korean bbq .
As a korean and a frequent consumer of korean bbq , i fear that some people who may have never tried korean bbq before would think this is actually proper korean bbq .
The side dishes were either too salty , too oily , or not flavorful at all .
Turns out the owner , staff , and chef are all not korean , according to the waiter that served us .
This would not be an issue if the food even marginally reminded one of korean cuisine as the restaurant 's name implies , but none of the food served to us did except the rice .
I would never go here again .
Excellent service , great ambience , nice bread bowl variety , but the food was not up to par .
You know it 's bad when we do not ask to take home leftovers as that 's our normal thing ( take some home for second dinner later on ! ) perhaps it was our faults for ordering barbecue at a steakhouse , but for $ 25 / person , you expect that it will be good regardless .
I do not know why we even try giving this restaurant 2nd , 3rd , 4th chances .
They obviously do not know steak temperatures .
Never going back again .
The food has never disappointed me and prices are affordable .
They re not really the smiley type but they try their best to get their job done .
It s quite chaotic cause there are so many customers and not that much walking space .
She stated that they do not do tastings and the alcohol was weighed so they could not just give me a little .
They were very accommodating although i suspect if we had not pushed it they would have just left it at no .
Ambiance was nice and they were not too busy .
You can not go wrong with them .
Seriously , does anyone know when this store is not busy ?
Trader joe 's is simply not worth traveling across town for .
It 's just not ideal , unless you live nearby .
The service was good but not outstanding .
I am not sure why he had to print them again as my first one and the second one were two exactly same bills , lol .
There are lots of tables , more space in general , and a nice patio outside whereas the midtown location is cramped and does not have a patio .
I may not know much about fine cooking or anything along those lines , but i loved every single bite of it .
The chocolate cake they gave my girlfriend was also pretty great ; it was not too sweet , and included with it was a dollop of house - made whipped cream .
I literally have no complaints !
It was very popular there , but it 's not quite so at the one in henderson .
The cashier seemed plain miserable and needs to take some happy pills or find another job where she does not have to help people !
No big deal .
I do not recommend giving any information to this company unless you are absolutely sure you wish to see it through .
I have not seen or spoken to a doctor .
After this ordeal i will not reschedule .
Not good .
You get a bit of wiggle room with beef , but definitely not with chicken .
Not to kick up a fuss , but just so they are aware for future consistency purposes .
Apparently , since my dish was prepared first , she took the blame for rushing the cook to hurry and finish hers so that there would not be a long gap between servings - a common problem that i have noted in other reviews of similar places .
This is by far the best hawaiian i have had in las vegas , and i can not wait to go back and try some other items .
So soft and delicious and i do not feel quite so guilty eating all those carbs when i know it 's made from super fresh ingredients and no preservatives .
Do not get me wrong ... their sandwiches are really fresh and delicious , but they are smallish and are pretty much just like something you 'd easily throw together at home .
We said we never got it , and he said he had no idea what was going on in the back , and asked if we wanted it then .
My daughter 's parmesan pasta , had no parmesan , etc. it took another 10 minutes to get the bbq sauce and parmesan .
Again , the waiter just said he did not know what was going on in the kitchen .
We were not the only one with problems .
The restaurant was not busy .
We will not go back .
2 hours , for a mediocre meal , and terrible service is not something i need to go through again .
So it might not be the most comfortable but it certainly is somewhat authentic .
To be honest i love the staff , they have always been kind and provided prompt service ... but i will no longer be a customer if this place due to the cheapness i have encountered .
I just have no patience and do not like waiting .
I also do not think they take reservations .
I can not emphasize enough how sick i am of walking into restaurants that are super dirty -- especially most hawaiian places .
The steaks are not bad ( you can do better ) .
All in all , if you are ever in charlotte and you do not get a chance to go here , no worries .
Wife and i had not been to an outback in a while but we were given a gift card and had a discount coupon so thought we would give it another chance .
My wife ordered the ribeye and it was very thin , no fat to speak of and over cooked so dry , literally no juice or flavor .
The shrimp really did not have a nice flavor and they were cold .
Not a good sign .
They are a good place for drinks , the onion , a burger or ribs , but please do not order the steaks .
The service was above par and i could not believe there was a place in glendale finally .
I did a google search and called all around las vegas but there was no one who could help me on a saturday and there were no hospitals with an ophthalmologist on call .
This was not good !
I can not thank him enough for treating me on an emergency basis and easing my anxiety .
( not to be a wet blanket , but frozen " organic " chicken breasts preserved in some " special " preservative does not inspire confidence . )
I know have also recommend fruit juices , which i do not drink because i am trying to limit sugar , and also liquor , but i do not drink so i can not speak to that .
Not terrible .
My only complaint is i can never eat $ 20 worth so it 's not an especially appealing concept for light eaters / small ladies .
I will keep it simple : long wait to order our food , burnt pancakes , and food that is not worth the amount of money they want you to pay .
This dennys location has never let us down .
They also have a nice selection of different foods you might not find other places .
I hear their mac and cheese is good but have not tried it myself .
They can not get an order right .
Forget ordering a salad you will never get it .
Good job but it is not hard to toss a hunk of meat on a grill .
I can not say that it was any better than what i would have served at home .
The dressing was not bad but it was not anything to write home about either .
The whole salad was a disgrace that should not have been served .
The waitress smiled but after serving the food , we never saw her again .
We never go here unless we are coerced by friends and the group wants steak or , once , we were given a gift certificate .
I am not too familiar with italian food , but i do love me pizza and pasta !
I will not comment on what my coworkers ordered as they all seemed to enjoy their food regardless .
Have not had such a good waitress in quite awhile .
I we nt once years ago before they moved spots and was not pleased , but tried it again recently .
I will no longer wait 45 minutes for marcellos , this place is as good or better without any wait time .
And so was the rest of my body - no , i did not get a massage , but this place ... the ambiance was upscale , relaxing and trendy ( fruit - infused water , anyone ?
This could work for people who are on a tight schedule , but i am not sure if i really like that ...
Little piggies and fingers did come out nice and pretty , but i could not really tell it apart from my $ task - oriented asian nail salon -- which might not have all the fufu , but at least i get to keep the extra $ $ for the same quality !
I probably will not be coming back here unless i get bribed , but i will definitely recommend this place to friend$ $ $.
She had asked them to substitute the sauce for a red sauce and there was no issue .
Did not rate my visit last year thinking it was an " off " night .
After yesterday 's lunch , i am certain i will not be back .
There simply is not any reason - it 's just " so - so " and completely unremarkable .
He could not have been nicer .
Alex was very kind and professional and told me that we did not deserve the treatment from the last company .
The last company told us that they could not replace our pump motor because our warranty company denied it which , in fact , they had not .
Alex told me that they will never deny the job while a tech is on - site if it is obvious a repair / replacement is needed .
He even told me that they will replace the motor , at no cost to us , if something happens to it in the future .
Not hickory tavern .
Our waitress really tried her best , but it was not enough to overcome the rest of the experience .
I am not one to expect a double pour when ordering a single , but i also do not expect to order a gin and tonic with hardly any gin .
I would not go back , but if you decide to go , stick to beer / wine and do not settle for cold tater tots lol .
Can never clean the plate unless i starved the morning of .
Not quite the authentic french quarter food , but still a decent place to have lunch at in uptown .
Not only was the food amazing but the service as well .
I can not recommend them .
Apparently the chef did not feel like obliging her , and sent me out a well - done burger instead .
Looking at them , i was skeptical to mix them on my burger , so after experimenting on my plate i did discover that no , sweet and spicy honey mustard and smoky bbq sauce do not create a favorable taste once mixed together .
But if you advertise yourself as a sports tavern and you can not make a good burger , that is a complete out for me .
For two people , i would not waste your time on this place .
Good location , price , and food ( just avoid hot pot menus if you are looking for the authentic korean hot pot experience , because it just does not taste the same ) .
No wonder the restaurant was empty . it took 45 minutes to get our food ..
If that was not bad enough my side order of parmesan rice was nothing more than a thinly disguised scoop of rice a roni .
Customer service is great ... can not go wrong with young , nice , pretty girls .
He ordered the steak and it was 25 $ and looked like it was only 5 oz and it came with cold uncooked potatoes .. and no veg .
I have been to the location on yonge and eglington and it was amazing so i expected way more .. not coming here again .
This is no joke .
If you like fat brisket , low quality food and no air on a hundred degree day , then you might like this garbage .
I really hope i do not get food poison tonight .
11:20 - people around us are getting their drink and food orders taken , some of these people came in after us , we have not been greeted by a server .
11:35 - still not greeted by a server , so we stood up and left .
I do not have a shred of tolerance when it comes to being ignored in a restaurant .
If you do not want to send a server to my table , you can not have my business .
Scallop potatoes & cream of spinach were not properly cooked ( still raw -ish ) .
The sushi is not premium level but it 's still great for the price .
I think we have found our favorite place for a simple , casual , fast bite for those tuesday night 's when you do not want to cook .
It will not break the bank so it 's worth trying at least once .
I would not consider dickeys a bbq spot for good food .
There brisket has no flavor and is cut on a machine instead of hand slice and not smoked or even well seasoned , if you are looking for good style bbq this is not hte place .
I was just told by another surgeon last week that under today 's standards , lasik is not done on anyone whose vision is worse than - 7.00 .
The most offensive part was when i started working in the court system - he went from saying i was over - corrected to my eyes over - responded - so it was my eyes ' fault , not his .
Run - do not walk - to anybody else .
He 's too interested in pushing the limits and does not care about the outcome .
I do not love trader joes .
Not sure how people with large suv 's or trucks manage to park correctly ( key word ) in their lots because it is impossible .
You can not walk down an aisle without there being 20 other people clutter there .
Never thought i would be a lover of microwavable rice .
Not so much .
I can not grocery shop here .
They are too limited on what they stock and quite frankly , i do not get down with the whole " eat organic " thing which most of their items are .
I just ai not about that life .
Chef bens would not grab a pen and paper and take down my order and just assist a regular customer that orders from my work place all the time .
I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone nor will i ever order from them again .
I figures there would be no better way to celebrate my birthday than to treat myself to the complete spa experience !
Ea red door did not fall short !
You do not find many owners going above and beyond or leaving it to the minions to handle .
I am single and can not always finish a loaf - just do not eat enough bread in a week and to me - never freezes well .
Unfortunately this location does not have these : ( .
This location seemed a little pricy too ... so feeding a family of 4 will not happen very often here .
So go there for the food but do not do any celebrations at this locations .
Do not get me wrong .
I was a little worried when the technician came out and did not fix my pump that sounded like a jet engine .
Erin had the audacity to come and apologize for the slow time but i will never forget the striking sound and the pain the wall had to go through .
I am asian and my hair is not easy to cut , so kudos to frank and all the other stylists that have filled in in the past when i did not call ahead to book an appt .
I have never had a bad hair day since 2001 .
Because of my work , a good massage is not just a luxury ; it is a necessity .
Selfishly , i am hoping he does not get too many requests after this post to still have time to fit me in !
The consistency of quality here is amazing and i have never been disappointed by them at all .
I mean they are not quite waving at you as you park but they notice you right away .
The breads are perfect and there is really not trick to them at all , their secret is they just made the bread the way people used to .
No additives , no flavor enhancers , nothing besides quality ingredients and a staff that knows what they are doing .
At eight dollars for this particular loaf i can not say i will make this a weekly stop but every couple of weeks they can bet on seeing me in there .
The food here is not authentic korean food .
This place has 5 . kim chi was one of them and even that was not very good .
The meets were ok but not marinated properly .
So if you looking for a place to eat just meat and your not into real korean food this is the place to go .
Not acceptable ...esp for a $ 10 salad !
We finally need to throw in the towel on this joint though ... not only does the price seem to change depending on who rings it up ( and it s always more than what the online menu says it is ) , but last week we got take out salads again , and they were the worst yet !
We can always tell when they do not serve us fresh pitas , but these were so bad , we could see just how stale and old they were just by looking at them .
Could not believe they actually served them to customers .
And , the chicken was dry and definately not freshly cooked .
It 's just a quick , inexpensive place when you feel like texas bbq , and not thirty minute drive to mesa .
No wait on a sunday morning .
If you do not like to wait for a spot , this restaurant is not for you because it is always busy .
She is great at recommending great skin care products , yet not pushy whatsoever .
She has also taught me shaping techniques and recommended some amazing brow mousse that i now can not live without .
I highly recommend scheduling an appointment with renee lange , you will not be disappointed !
And it was not overly good , or bad ... just mediocre bbq .
I made a big deal of the free ice creme to my coworker .... and would not you know it ...
I am not sure when i will be coming back .
Not sure what happen to them ... probably will never come back to this location .
Nope we did not leave a tip cause it was a pickup .
I had not been for years because i have always had such awful service here , but after a winning streak at several surrounding denny 's , i thought i 'd give " the bad denny 's " a try again .
We left before even ordering food and i will not be back again .
If you hate food , enjoy depressing scenes of humanity and waiting endlessly for service that does not arrive , this is the denny 's of your dreams .
Just not bad enough to waste sixty dollars on awful food .
It did not contain a whole lot of meat but was still pretty filling .
The meat is usually pretty decent , although not the most fresh you will see .
Come with a loose pair of pants and some clothes you do not really care about , as you will be full and smelling like bbq when you are done here !
Not sure where the negative reviews came from , but they have definitely stepped up their game .
She managed to get me scheduled for the next day , no problems .
I do not know what to expect anymore out of chain restaurants .
Since most of the restaurants were closed , we had no choice but to try and eat here .
Went inside , was seated fast because it was not busy at all .
They were not busy and there were still dirty tables waiting to be cleaned .
I do not know , and i will not know anytime soon .
And i could not forget the service .
They never fail to take care of my myself or my family .
I have found that outback is not consistent from one location to another .
I liked the flavor of the fries , but they were not crispy at all .
My wife did not like them as well because of that .
It was not as big a deal for me , but i agree with her that is the ideal fry .
I have had chef ben 4 times now ( 3 of the times i ate there and 1 time i got carry out ) i am by no means a sushi expert but , i have had it numerous times at numerous places before .
It is not a very big place , but they really treat you well .
Both of these give you so much food and they are not expensive at all .
I have never had fishy sushi or gotten sick from any of it .
We can not wait to go back and try other goodies .
Tee even offered suggestions and items that were not on the menu , for our vegan daughter .
She is amazing ... and i am not only saying this because we are both polish .
My skin looked flawless and my pores have never been so clean !
I can not wait to get back this summer and have another treatment at the red door .
I just hope lucy is not booked .
Technician was condescending and curt , and was not interested in helping or answering questions .
Service was polite , but i do not like how i was charged to purchase a side when i subbed a vegetable for the included potato .
Server said there 'd be a small fee , which i am fine with - instead , i was rung up for a full side order and simply did not receive one with my meal .
If you can not do substitutions , just say so .
Maybe not pick the special next time .
I have asked a few times for squid , but they say that no one asks for it ( except me , so i must be no one lol ) so that 's why they do not have it on the menu .
I can not / will not let anyone else touch my tresses !
You only get so much and if you are with a group of friends it may not work out that well .
It is a great experience and something new to try out in the city however after awhile the food quality just is not that great , the portions are not the best and everything is just average .
Wish they would reconsider their delivery area as no other asian restaurant serves where i live and they would make a killing .
Come to see them , and do not go anywhere else !
Fair warning though if you do not like mushrooms you will prob hate this dish because the mushroom flavour is overwhelmingly good .
The mash was a little sour which i did not really like but that 's not the highlight of the dish anyways .
I have never experienced such shitty service before my meal tonight .
If you do not mind waiting 2 - 3 hours to see the doctor for your appointment , then this is the place for you .
I read on here that people had issues with wait times but thought they were an exaggeration ; they were not .
You will not be disappointed .
I do not know how graduate students survive without trader joe 's .
It did not come as a surprise , but the variety and the quality of the products ( especially diary products ) are quite different .
I used to love the ones ( wheat , plain , and garlic ) sold at ca stores so much , but the wi one that comes from ma lacks in flavor and the texture is not right .
Though the wine selection at the madison tjs is not excellent , but once in a while you find a decent bottle at a bargain price .
There is no way this place is going to stay in business long if they are not open on weekends past 11 pm .
Be warned , do not plan on going here late at night .
I really like how the kitchen is open so i can see them cook my food ~ the katsu was pretty good can not go wrong with deepfried goodness haha & the mac salad was not overly creamy .. spam musubi like most places are premade ..
I love cheese which i guess means i enjoyed this burger haha it came with what i thought were potato chips but turned out to be garlic waffle fries yummmmo ~ i am sure this kauai juicy burger is not as good as the original in minnesota but i am also sure it will satisfy your cravings for the time being ~!
It s pretty spacious so even if it gets busy it will not be a ridiculous wait .
I was able to make a reservation but i think it depends on time day and number of people ... so probably not during it 's busiest dinner hours .
They have very decently priced main dishes like pbs for $ 9 which they do not charge additional tax .
I have to say , i like the food here but the service we got last night was really awful and the food just does not make up for it .
I was a bit under the weather so i was not feeling super hungry but i still managed to finish my meal .
A few others commented on the portion sizes but it was not a big deal .
Looked good but i did not try it .
He basically told us we were not allowed to move around , which i understand for the purpose of serving and the bills , but for a long table , i think it 's appropriate to stand up once in a while to talk to people on the other end , but it just made him even more flustered .
He even accused my dad of moving seats which he did not even do .
I will likely not return to this location because of the service we received .
Nothing you could not get anywhere and nothing special .
I travel all over the country and have eaten in every state except alaska and i will never set foot in this place again .
Fun if your looking to party but not if your looking for a true new orleans style menu .
Then our waitress broke my debit card while away and did not even mention it .
This has not been the case recently , with the yuengling being off colored and bitter tasting .
The cooling system must also be off , because the chilled glasses are not doing it .
The menu never changes and some healthy entrees would seem to be more family and / or couples friendly .
Bar food is not for everyone .
If you are not trying to progress forward , you are moving backward .
I wake up every day in amazement that i no longer need glasses or contact lenses !
Now , i have a high standard for thus dish because no one 's is better than my auntie 's but the french quarter 's come close .
I had the andouille sausage on the side , just in case they were not right but i was pleasantly surprised .
So if you order it you will not be eating anything else .
I did not have time to stay in phoenix for long .
I had never heard of nor been to chef ben , and when i walked inside i was already a bit timid .
No one other than the staff and chef were inside .
This is not a fancy formal place .
It really is fast sushi -- no , not fast food sushi , just fast .
The roll was not drenched in some dreadful sauce , but served as rolled .
Andrew was at my home today because my pool filter was not working .
Got the london broil sandwich but would not get it again .
Very tough and no flavor .
Will not ever be returning here .
Not sure why i am posting this because i do not think they read their reviews .
The food , some good , some not so much .
Me thinks not .
I have seen the bad reviews here but did not have a bad experience at all with this company , i highly recommend them .
If you like soft crust in pizza you should request ' not well done ' because their default is a well done crunchy crust .
I am not sure if i want to eat hot pot or grill meat or even noodle any time of the day .
The wait staff here is pleasant and speak good english but i should not have any problem to read the menu as it is printed in korean , english and chinese !
The duck though was a little tough , i probably will not be ordering it again .
But it was not bad for a cold day .
The tables are so close together , they never used to be so close .
If u want a romantic setting , forget it . not a place for an intimate dinner and very loud . an honest review
Let me preface this review by first saying that i am by no means a barbecue expert .
I like what i like , and i do not like what tastes like crap ;) my boyfriend and i were having my parents over to his place for their first time , so we wanted to get their favorite - good ol ' bbq !
Unfortunately , i was not very impressed with dickey 's .
I believe we paid $ 40 to feed 5 people - not bad !
I did not care for the bbq sauce , because it was a bit runny for me ( i like really thick , syrupy sauce ! )
Unfortunately , i do not think i will be going back to dickey 's .
Coffee not fresh , lobby music too loud .
Everyone was pleased and that 's not always easy !
If it was not for the fact that our kids were getting sleepy we would have gotten desert as well .
I did not want mashed potatoes with my steak so they gave me some grilled veggies that were awesome .
The only negative thing i would say is that their asparagus is not that great .
They are large and come with a sauce that i do not care for .
Service was friendly and attentive but not overly hovering .
Do not let it fool ya !
Never coming back .
The regular teriyaki is a little sweeter than we are " used to " but not so much so that we would not keep ordering it .
Need to get people behind the counter that are more customer service oriented and treat it like a business and not a joke or , like they are inconvenienced by customers .
Kauai cafe is not your typical cookie cutter " hawaiian bbq " place .
No half - hearted bootleg island - wan na be food here .
( i am born and raised in hawaii just in case you could not tell by now ) some menu highlights and recommendations that i have tried : heineken beer batter chicken .
If you want real hawaiian food food you better make it here early on friday they usually sell out . for 15.99 you got : kalua pig w / cabbage 2 scoops rice 1 scoop mac salad ahi poke chicken long rice squid luau lomi salmon poi ( if you do not want it , give it to me ! )
Will not repeat .
Their plates are a good portion size ( i could not finish my chicken katsu ) .
You know them not having pulled pork is like mcdonald 's being out of big macs !
Not sure if there will be a repeat visit anytime soon ..
Sizzling chicken plate filled with cartilage and tiny bones ... not mentioned on the menu !
This is the second time now that we can not even use the pool because it 's all messed up !
And then they do not show up to make the repairs .
Not the most authentic or wide range of ayce kbbq .
And the meat was not even great quality either .
On the slip of paper to reorder more food , when asked what was the difference between the liver or some other meat listed , the server was not able to identify it ...... however , servers were nice and attentive - checking in on us and constantly refilling water ( do not know why they did not just give us a pitcher of water ) .

I am not even sure if it was a filet cut because all of the filets i have eaten have been thick .
There was literally no sauce on the bottom of the bowel .
They offered to make another one but we did not have time so they gave her a gift card for $ 20 to come back and took her steak off the bill , just her steak though not her whole meal .
No personality .
Their items are a little pricey or at least they were a few months back when i went but if you have no problem spending $ 10 on a single layer standard size sandwich then they are worth it .
We did not even finish our wings , and that 's saying something .
The decor is nice , not over done or gaudy .
The tables and booths are spaced out and not on top of each other .
I highly recommend this pool service corporation , you will not be disappointed !!!
We did not .
It was not but the waiter brought us au jus anyway .
The au jus was very watered down and very cool -- not good with little flavor .
The sandwich was tough and just not that good either .
I thought he 'd never leave to go back to the kitchen .
That was awkward and we did not like it .
It just did not sit right .
We still were not thrilled with this outback and doubt we would return here .
Been going to this place for over ten years now , excellent service appetizers are devine and creative , the escargot is absolutely wonderful , steaks are good , however not very prime tasting , but good enough
I do not normally write review .
I could not believe , the waiter said , " i know it , asian people always change their mind .
I was not expecting such service in such a nice restaurant .
The food was great , but just could not make up for the poor services .
I will not return to this location because of the poor service we received .
I feel this restaurant does not welcome asian people at all .
Not sure if it 's too much soy sauce , salt , msg , or what ... but it is not pleasant .
The service here can be a little slow sometimes considering how busy the place is , because there are not enough servers .
First we were shown to our table which was not set up , missing chairs .
Then when the steaks were brought out , not everyone received their dinner .
But will not go back to this outback .
I do not often go on nfl sundays or for real big sporting events , so maybe that 's the tough time .
The service was fast and accurate , and i do not have a bad thing to say about it .
Not sure what pool service should entail but i get inconsistent service .
Water level dropped to point that it burned up my motor and then they explained their policy about not filling the pool to run up my bill .
Dr. wellish was recommended to me by optometrist and i can not thank him enough .
I love a bargain as much as the next woman , if not more , but this is not the place to cut corners .
I do not think i will be back as there are so many other italian places in york region that are just as good and better value .
The prices are on the higher side of being affordable , but understandable as they attempt to make them a little more beneficial and " healthier " to some extent ( not always true , but they try in a lot of cases . )
Here are some of my favorite products i 'd recommend trying : korean short ribs , dark chocolate mint creams , sweet potato fries , chili pepper sauce ( not as spicy , but has a great flavor ) , and many of their meat cuts are pretty great too .
Really not worth 5 star at all .... i ordered the da furfer rider ... the meat is super super super salty .
... i do not care what is in the meat .... it just too salty to eat ... i left over all the meat in dish ..... i love aloha kitchen better ....
And when i called back , they said that they could not come back into next tuesday !
Could not even bump me up to the top of the list .
No apologies or nothing .
Spoke to the manager mike and he was very condescending and was even cussing when i requested to be bumped to an earlier appointment since they are not able to fix my problem after coming out twice .
Not really sure what happened since my last visit , but wow was it great !
Last 2 times the waitress disappears and never returns , no drinks , food order was wrong and we had to get the manager to stop and fix it and then we have to chase them down to pay the bill .
Each time they write down parts numbers , but my booster pump has not been replaced or even repaired .
Their veggie pho is light , flavorful , and not overly salty .
I would say there is no reason you would not get great service with them .
Took almost an hour for our food to come out ( only 2 adults and 2 children so not a huge order ) .
Waiter was ok until after we got our food then never came around after that .
Never returning to this location ever again .
Granted this is not exactly arthur bryant 's or smoque , and it does not pretend to be .
When the company they had contracted to install it for me came out , they said that it was not even the correct brand of pool light .
The two people i spoke with - one person who worked in the office and another a manager - both got immediately defensive and started questioning my story , as if they did not believe me .
The manager , mike , told me that there is no way they would even know what brand of light they installed ???
Do they not keep records ?
And she never once said that she was not sure if it was the correct information .
I have never felt so disrespected or unappreciated as a customer .
I have no idea how this company stays in business .
The katsu sauce was not in our bag so make sure you ask / check for it .
Great wings , great sandwiches & wraps , and even my salad was awesome ( i do not expect much out of a sports bar salad , but it surprised me ! ) .
" dylan " the waiter got pissed we decided to leave after 50 mins of waiting and stated " we will we are busy here , you are not the only ones ! "
I will not return .
He not only helped install the new motor in the brutal heat ( with my pain in the ass golden retriever running around him ) but walked me through the measures to take to prevent it s demise from a storm again , timeframes on cleaning / fixing the filters , things to look for i was not aware of , and gave me his number so if i have any questions he can try to help over the phone so i do not have to make & pay for a full appointment .
I can not say enough how big of a pain in the ass this pool is even before the storms so i am really happy with the help and additional service tyler provided us .
Overwhelmed at what to buy ... do not be .
I do not remember the name for the last one lol ( refer to pics ) .
I have had all of these dishes elsewhere and i personally do not think it was the best here .
I have not had this with garlic at other places , so this was a genuine surprise even though it 's something so small .
Service was quite slow , but it was full house so i did not expect much from that department .
Otherwise i would not bother coming .
The food is fine , the price is fine , the service is what it is ( straight forward , not rude not nice , just order ) .
You want to eat at a place that 's not sanitary ?
I do not .
Since this place is open 24 / 7 , it probably explains why the food is not as fresh .
I am not a difficult customer .
" tip ? " this place is recommended to those who want a cheap late night meal where they will not mind the servers telling them how much to tip .
I have finally found " the one . " can not recommend her enough .
Who does not love a good tater ?
Negatives : the burger did not have much flavor .
I read a few reviews mentioning long waits but never experienced that myself .
They have never disappointed .
Let 's not forget that it is very reasonably priced .
I have not been to the other ophthalmologists in the city but i can sure recommend the wellish institute .
We opted for this restaurant because other restaurants in the area were full , and there were no cars outside the restaurant .
They never bring the portions you ask for .
Rude , unfriendly and act like they do not see you .
Can not believe they are still in business .
Ai not so funny now huh ?
Went by pharmacy at 3:30 and no prescription so called again .
They had no note that i was leaving the next morning and had not called in yet .
Placed order online and when i got home did not receive the ham from lumberjack breakfast , called store and was told by female employee that i can get refunded but have to wait for manager to come in .
An hour goes by and no call , so i called up and spoke to hector who is the manager on duty , he says he ca nt refund will need to wait for general manager , waited 2 more hours still no call .
This store deserves no stars .
Enough so that i did not dock pints for the sea-saltless edamame .
We really like this place , but i am not going to say i am a ' fan ' just yet .
Inside is a little industrial , so if moose makes you think it is going to have a warm woodlands feel , do not .
I really was thinking that spa week was an awesome promotion , get your facial on week , but now i can not tell if it actually causes the spas to be lazy .
Once completed and one person cutting in line , the front desk escorts me back with another customer , does not show us around and leaves me to show the other patron how to use the electronic lock ( used them at joya :) facial :
I could not get mircoderm since i use an acid treatment regularly on my face ( must have 2 week break ) i got a 30 minute facial that was a makeup removal , execration and a face mask .
I got a week arm massage and it was over and not to mention cut short by 10 minutes , you do need to honor the 10 minutes i stood at the front counter .
I had asked the front desk to shorten and add a polish change so my nails would match ( i would pay extra ) when the nail tech came to get me , should told me she did not know and did not have time .
I am sorry , i do not know why , but the cultural cheaper nails places ( andy's , chic and kens ) they know how to give a pedicure ... they get down in there scrub it off and slap on some perfect polish .
I do expect a $ 20 massage on my feet in a $ 50 pedicure , not paraffin which i could drip a cancel on my foot .
The whole place was lack luster , small locker room and i am not even sure there was a steam room , i was definitely not shown around or told there was .
However , i will not be going back , i fell so let down ... i was so excited and the follow thru was just not there , but they did have time to plug some products .
Everything is healthy and affordable , and there are so many unique products that you can not find anywhere else .
It 's not that they are gross , if anything , just lacking in flavor .
There were no leaves around the pool pump and one week later the same problem occurred and they told me it would be a week before they could come back out .
I understand that home warranty companies hire the cheapest and by the looks of it the worst companies they can find so i am not surprised and i will be canceling my home warranty and will not have aaron pools back to my house .
We sat down at the bar and the girl there started greeted us but was not friendly .
After that she never checked back in on us .
I just did not think that was too appropriate it was just not the best place i have been to .
I think they should have taken their convos to the back or just some place else not around the guests .
The food was great but i probably will not return to eat there again .
Can not wait to go back .
I eat a lot of pho around the phoenix area and have to say this was some of the very best no question .
Their other dishes looked very good as well , can not wait to try the rest of the menu !
I do not know if it was a special thing for that saturday , but a lady offered us a wine tasting .
Not only did we fall in love with one of the wines , but the prices were actually reasonable !
I sneaked a peak at the bill - not scary at all !
I never thought it was a place where i could get the majority of what i needed on my grocery list .
Now , i will say that i am not all about the two buck chuck wine , however i did pick up some really nice tempranillo for only $ 3.99 ( in fact , i am sipping on it while i type this review ) .
Back in the day when we had a gaggle of kids at home , i do not think tj 's would suit what i needed , however this is the place if you are just shopping for a small family !
The place would have gotten a 5 star from me however , they did not have the noddles for the day .
I do not know if people like coming and getting served .
Unable to decide , and this place not showing up on yelp , and other search site .
Steak flavorless , over cooked ( med rare ) and the shrimp had no seasoning & a freezer flavor !
Per all tjs , the prices are great -- this is not whole foods !
The meat selection is not the greatest , but for every other food item , tjs is my go - to .
There are many huge concrete poles and no loop , so you have to back out and turn around -- especially dangerous if you come in , realise there are no spaces , and have to leave .
After trying to order on yelp and being told i am to far ( 5 miles ) i called and was told to try the website i am not to far .
I call back and ask why they can not take my card and order .
She said the bank will not allow them to take a card over the phone .
If this were my business i would not lose $ 60 orders because of poor service from another company .
I would not order it again .
Incoming phone orders was annoying since no one picked up the calls ... so the phone rang constantly while one of the employees in the kitchen was apparently on the phone texting with no concern to answer the phones .
This restaurant is no exception .
Found this unique place on a recommendation from a friend .... and although we did not have dinner , , we had drinks .....
Staff could not have been nicer ...
I have not had any issues with the work performed by them .
Used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it but the last few times it has not been good .
The quality of food is not good , the zucchini planks were so greasy and the fries used to be really plentiful but instead there were hardly any fries at all .
There were bugs on the walls and the temperature was not controlled very well .
I am not a huge fan of their side orders , but the beef brisket is decent , as is their spicy bbq sauce , which i drowned it in .
The bbq nachos are so good we had some younger guy server and he sucked so bad we did not even want to go back again .
We were going to tell the manager about how great she was but i did not see her when we were leaving so i hope she reads this .
Do not forget to grab a free slice of bread .
They have lots of standard stuff like bibimbap or bbq pork belly + a few dishes you will not easily find elsewhere .
It took a while for me to decide what to eat as i did not really intend to get korean that day .
The portion was decent in portion and they were not skimpy on ingredients .
It was not .
We could not finish it all ( but mostly because my partner is a small eater ) .
I could not find a special reason to come again , or to avoid .
Been going to this place for over ten years now , excellent service appetizers are devine and creative , the escargot is absolutely wonderful , steaks are good , however not very prime tasting , my escape !!!!
So i have been to the outback ( all over , not just this one ) and i have to say that the typical experience we have had at outback ( which is usually in the 4 - star range ) is not what we have experienced here . we have been to this outback probably 4 times in the past 2 years .
Unfortunately , our experiences have been consistently sub-par , and it appears that we are not alone in noticing this ( often no wait on friday or saturday night ) .
Disappinting considerng that outback has always been one of our family 's and my parents ' favorites , but this location just has not cut it for us .
I would give this a full 5 star review if i had not been to some of the other elizabeth arden red door spas .
There are no jacuzzis , saunas , lap pools or any of the things i would typically think of when i think of red door spas .
If you are not super interested in anything other than the service you are getting , i would 100 % recommend the biltmore location .
The meat was so hard to cut and no taste to it .
Not sure what 's happened to this place lately .
Without customers there is no business , no profits , no jobs .
I mean they servers are not doing the cooking ( the customers are ) , but they are quick to keep the water glasses full , bringing the raw meats and bringing the check .
The place is quite big and usually do not need reservations unless there 's a big party going .
The decor is not good , but the food is tasty and worth it .
Do not know who is cutting their meats , but that new york i bought last weekend was an awful combination of fat and gristle .
And my friend 's sirloin was no better .
I called daniel he said that should not happen , but it did .
I found that i had to prime my pumps every morning , i knew that was not right .
I called and left messages with aaron pools , it was the memorial day weekend and knew no one would be there until tuesday .
They said they called and left a message , never happened probably dialed wrong .
My understanding is that 2 men came on tuesday at 2 , i was home , they never rang the bell .
I called them to come back but they would not until i called my warrenty company .
The receptionist was no help she did not know how to handle people that are upset .
He said once the pool fills you will never have to prime it and there will not be air in the system .
He double checked my filter he said there was not any problem with it .
My son said the buffalo chicken sliders was not that good !!!!!!!
Trader joe , i love you but i would visit more if i did not have to pay .
I would probably shop here more regularly if i was not charged to grocery shop .
The macaroni salad had a bit of spicyness to it which i was not expecting ( yummy ) .
We are driving from az up to portland and decided to stay for our first night in a best western plus in n las vegas , since we are not gamblers .
We were not disappointed !
Overall , a fine dining establishment , but the clientele is tacky ... do not bother dressing up for this place !
I was a bit reluctant as i think our last experience several years ago had not been memorable .
This is not at all the experience i have at my usual salon - no vibrating chairs or vigorous massage but a bit like pedicure meets podiatrist .
I will rate my food ( since i did not try hers , but i am on record previously not liking the " slam " ) .
Honestly i did not really taste the difference between this and a normal burger .
My wife ordered a bowl of soup which was not as big as she expected , nor as flavorful .
I am not rating this , just passing on the feedback .
Then when we wanted to purchase gift cards because they had a special bonus going ( and we could use them to pay for this meal ... not the bonus cards , just the gift cards ) they did not have any .
They advertised this bonus gift card special and then they had no gift cards .
I 'd say do not bother unless you want a slam on your birthday , or you are desperate .
The california chicken sandwich was good but the bun was so soggy i could not pick it up - had to use a knife and fork .
They also did not have any bread ready .
I am not sure if she 's a manager but i will not be going into this location again specifically because of the service we received from her .
It was not .
Do not order the fish sandwich no matter what anyone says , unless you like fish mcnugget sandwiches .
$ 42.00 for two fish sandwiches and fries that we did not finish or take home , 1 beer that my husband did not finish drinking , water for me , fried pickles ( tasted good not did not like the breading ) .
Overall not good food and not worth the price .
And out of all the empty tables - i did not understand why she did that .
Not a lot of seasoning .
We asked for another and never received it .
Yeah , he would not eat it .
I tried it and it just did not need it .
And then our server would not even get the payment .
Definitely will not go back .
We were lucky that all our guests did not show up , because we were out of food with only feeding 45 .
Not inpressed at all .
I had a pool guy come check it out and bought different pieces for it and it still never sealed the leak .
After my pool guy could not fix it , i ended up calling my home warranty company to come and fix it .
They have an extensive sushi menu and you will not be disappointed .
Great portion size , but the flavour was not all there , something was off about it .
I love it when my soup is served when it s still piping hot and bubbling , and it was not at all when the food came .
Not sure how busy this place gets but service was good overall .
Spend 50 dollars for two , not a single veggie could be provided for all you can eat .
I have not got any diarrhea for more than two years .
Now i am not only hungry buy also upset about the food i had .
There seems to be only one server , which did not pose an issue until more patrons arrived .
The server did not fill our waters once , as he was either too busy serving the other 2 tables , or filling napkins / condiments on other tables .
No small plates were given , so we had to use our napkins to avoid dropping drips and crumbs .
Both the spring rolls / eggrolls were not the best ...
I was hopeful there was a tofu pho dish , according to other photos i saw on yelp , however the server informed us they can not accommodate ... so i had to order the chicken pho ga .
Upon arrival , the bowl was much smaller than most pho spots ( only one size , no options ) .
I wanted to do lasik for a while , but was not comfortable with a few places that i visited .
To not have to worry about glasses , poking contacts in and out , breaking or scratching and cleaning glasses , is a blessing in disguise .
I have never given a review based on service before ... but after being yelled at by the staff here on multiple occasions , i need to voice out .
- chased after to tip more - told to be quiet rudely by the owner - yelled at to order faster - been pushed aside while we were lining up while i do not expect 5 star service , i think it 's common courtesy to use an indoor voice when speaking to customers and exercise basic manners .
The service tech tried to sell me something not needed and then finished the job poorly after 2 weeks of waiting .
No pressure gauge on filter they replaced , no access to empty my sand from my filter without a saw .
They took short cuts where they could and took the $ 250 paid by the warranty company ( he told me what he was paid ) and spent about 20 dollars of his time and less in parts to do what he called " the minimum amount required " , but not as much as should have .
Super uncool : my beer glass was incredibly not clean .
How does a bartender not look at the glass before pouring a drink ?
We had a party of 7 , waited about 30 mins was not bad at all .
Appetizer we ordered pancake and that was amazing , not too starchy , just brought scallion and seafoods .
Their jap chae was kinda on the wet side but the taste was not ruined .
The sides that comes with the entree also was good with all the traditional korean bbq side , but refills was not fast enough for us .
For such a crowed busy place , 5 workers was not enough , therefore it did effect their services .
Felt rush , when our beef short rib came out , they did not let us cook it as we go , but she literally dumped the beef all right onto the grill grrrr !
When your sides are done , you have to request for refills and that was not great !
She literally took our old plate and put more into the same plate , hmm not sure about that service there lol .
This place is no big deal .
Prices are not bad and they do have free ice cream which is always good in my book .
The brisket was tender but no flavor and dry .
Now the filter is not working at all anymore and i had to sit on the phone with my home warrenty company to request another pool service company come out and repair their fuck ups .
This was a disappointment compared to other outback restaurants , would not return to this one .
Does not even deserve one star !
There was a car sitting in front of me ( they must have a lot of patience ) and i never was shown any service .
After driving off , and not eating since at this point i would not have time to go anywhere else and be able to eat before going back to work , i called this location and asked them if their business was even open .
The employee told me their drive thru intercom is not working properly and when i asked to speak with the manager , she told me that they are extremely busy .
I have never been through a drive - thru and not be immediately helped , is not that what they are for ?
I instantly thought it would taste good and yeh dish definitely did not fail me .
Was not a fan of him telling us to take our time looking at the menu because he " really had to pee ! "
Have not been here for dinner .
It did not have much flavor or spice .
I just got prk done on both my eyes , and i could not be happier .
After the pre ops , i was not an eligible candidate for lasik , but a candidate for prk .
And that , to me , shows that they are not there for money like some of the other offices , but to do what is best for you .
Have not experienced this problem at the other locations .
He said he never received any email from the warranty co ... and started arguing with the buyers realtor which was the most unprofessional behavior imaginable .
He stormed out of the house with the realtor following him and she said sorry that you did not receive the email i know we had sent it , and as he was starting his truck she saw printed email on his clipboard on the seat ... he said oh yea it 's right here ... and left .. did not do any work .

Terrible customer service ... would not use them ever .
They have an entertainment book advertisement in the window but they will not accept the entertainment book coupon itself ... what gives ?
It does not matter how many other places i go , i am always down for a late night dirty breakfast .
This is the first time ever that a manager has not adjusted my bill .
I will never go back !
Do not get all the bad reviews .
The reason it 's not 4 stars is because it does not taste amazing and the seating could be better .
I know this may not be typical situation in most restaurants but it was a memorable experience and ill never forget it .
I had no idea how tight my muscles were and she worked some maaaaajor knots out of me .
I just can not say enough .
No one was at the drive thru and i went in .
The brisket was passable , but the experience was not good .
Food - excellent ( we ordered 4 mains and shared - all of them were excellent - no complains at all - pastas were made to perfection aldente !!
There 's really no good wing places like this nearby .
Been here couple times a year and never had problems .
I did not take it bc we do not do dessert .
I felt awful bc that was not my intention .
I do not know about the management now bc i have not been there in the past 6 months .
I got the smoked wings and requested drums only ( no up - charge ) .
The beer selection is decent , but by no means enough craft options for my liking .
Pricey . we never walk out of there spending less than $ 50 - includes a tip but that is splitting a meal .
Go there if we can not get in at chuggers .
We ordered the gumbo only to have the server explain to us that the kitchen guys said they were not making gumbo today .
Not a great selection at all .
Not a lot of flavor .
If you are looking for great new orleans style food , do n't eat at the french quarter , eat somewhere else .
Can not get out of there less than $ 30 plus tip .
I personally do not have a problem waiting for dr . 's that are amazing .
Starting to go downhill , the prime rib is always good and you could not beat the steak for the price , but this last visit or two was spotty , but last was terrible .
25 mins later still no food , finally it get s there , it was sitting in the back for sure , could tell be the temp .
My prime rib was terrible , tough , dry , overcooked , her steak was like a hunk of fat , 1 / 2 was a total waste and no crab !
Crab came out 10 minutes later and when it did , there was no cracker for the shell , they told us they ran out !
Finally get one 5 minutes later , but still no seafood fork to remove the meat from inside !
If you do not qualify for lasik , or you are right on the cusp , they will suggest prk to you .
While that 's true , it does not tell the whole story .
It 's more the difference between getting a vasectomy ( lasik ) and having an angry gorilla tear off your testicles ( prk. ) the only sane solution when offered prk is to say , " i will come back when i can afford the implantable contact lenses . " oh , and , with prk , you will not be able to see jack shit for months .
Lasik or implantable contact lenses - do not do prk .
I have asked for a few minor modifications such as a gravy for the mashed potatoes which they do not have but our waitress recommended the mushroom sauce usually used for steak and it was great on the mashed potatoes .
I do not need to spend a fortune at a fancy steakhouse when the outback down the street meets my every steakhouse need .
Once you see sharron for a pedicure , you will never go anywhere else !
The t- bone steak was 70 % fat and i showed the waitress and she did not care at all .
Perhaps it s a little of both i do not know .
Never again will i go into a dennys .
Not doing it sooner !!
Unfortunately i did not qualify for lasik because of my astigmatism so i had to have the prk surgery , which has a longer healing time .
I went in for my one month follow up this week and my vision is so great that i received a notification to the dmv that i no longer have a restricted license due to vision correction !
I did not feel rushed or like just a number , i felt like i was his only patient that day .
The day of the surgery i was given some medication to take the edge off and my eyes were numbed , so i did not feel much of anything .
Whenever i am craving italian food , i always go to grazie ristorante because not only are they nearby , they have so many different kinds of fresh pastas and pizzas to choose from .
I like this location because there 's always space and i never have to wait for a seat .
I really could not control myself .
Not ooey gooey like cinnabon , but delicious all the same !
They replied to the ag by sending a doctored quote , this time adding $ 76 for " freight " , deducting the $ 65 they claim was never a security deposit , and then writing in a balance due of $ 11 .
I always thought bbq brisket should be cooked slow roasted with amazing flavors , not at dickeys , reminds me of deli brisket .
There is no char to the meat and no seasoning , wish there was a truly good bbq place here
When i asked for more water she said no and insisted we leave . food was good though .
Maybe the " food " is good there , but i will never go there for sushi .
It was a different experience for him since he has never enjoyed the concept of " paying to cook your own meal " .
I am not sure what they use to test the chlorine and ph levels of the water , but it varies greatly in comparison to my home test kit and leslie pools ' computer .
I 'd estimate the pool is swept once a month and has never been skimmed unless the visit just happened to be the day after a storm .
The wait time was not terrible , i had all of the tests done , and then the doctor came in to explain that i was only a candidate for prk , that i would not be able to drive for 10 days , and for six months afterwards it was sunglasses 24 / 7 outside , vitamin c , fish oil , special prescription eyedrops , all this other stuff .
From the hours of tests , they could not even provide me with a prescription , and i would have to pay for my medical records ( hello - the records are mine .
Why can not i have a copy of my own medical records without having to pay you a per page fee !? ) .
When i called back , they did not honor this , and said they do not do any exams at all .
It has been two weeks since i was screened for prk and i still do not have glasses .
I am going somewhere else to get my prescription and my glasses because i really would love to be driving legally and i really do not see the point in going back to these people for prk .
We did not have any problem with the customer service .
And even though it is not authentic korean , it still is good food at an affordable price !
Water glass was not kept full , and was not refilled for a good ten minutes despite me asking the server for it pointedly .
Brother 's steak took extremely long because the waiter said it was not well - done .
Potato soup was good , not too oniony .
Do not order any grilled chicken or fish .
- inexpensive - table cooking for 2 people is ~ $ 30 , other korean dishes are ~ $ 10 - 15 - fast service - they bring out your food almost within 5 minutes after you order cons - does not take reservations , super long line if you go during dinner time - staff are not very polite but you can see that they are all working their butts off because it 's so busy my favourite is their pork bone soup ( $ 9 ) and the pork belly table cooking ( $ 30 ) !
I explained i have had this done a number of times and never had any issues .
The manager never apologized or thanked me for my business .
This woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber .
I do not plan on going back there again .
This was a disappointment to me as i would not mind waiting for some good french cuisine .
I do not know much about about french food so i was curious .
The staff was friendly and service good but that is not enough to bring me back so i will not repeat .
The only reason it did not get a 5 was the service .
The place was not very busy but our server made us feel very rushed .
The place was not even half full .
Not a bad price for what you get .
They would not listen to any discussion on the billing practice .
She truly does not care that this complaint will be elevated to the bbb and attorney general .
They do not care if the people they service feel cheated .
It 's all dandy if you get the results and charges you expect , but if there is a disagreement , they simply will not listen to you .
For dessert , the chocolate cake sounded delicious but i could not stuff any more into my mouth .
If you are not afraid of something that tastes good , give them a try .
But i did not get the impression they are going to fix the issues .
Not terrible just subpare to start with .
Salad had almost no dressing .
We finally chased down the server who was not good about checking on the food and he had it cooked properly .
No it tasted like they cleaned the grill with grill cleaner and scrapped all the old junk off the grill and then recooked it on there .
I felt like it was my fault for not ordering a rare steak .
I am not sure how they could have made the meal any worse .
Dinner on a tuesday night is never a major deal , and we were seated quickly , and had prompt service .
I ordered my usual " lady " steak - the victoria ( 7 oz ) medium rare - and i love the fact that i have never had a problem getting my steak cooked right - so many places bring me completely rare , or much worse - medium well steaks .
The ending results with my vision were remarkable , and it would not have been possible without dr. wellish and the rest of his amazing staff at the wellish vision institute .
Although i was very nervous when i considered doing this surgery , thanks to one specific staff member rebecca , all my fears were gone , and i could not wait for my surgery date .
I have never felt so blessed to be able to do something as simple as to see .
Some people do not understand how frustrating it can be to see blurry at all times and not see objects without halos around them , but i do .
Dr. wellish changed my life in ways i can not explain , and it all started with a dream to be able to see without using my contacts or glasses .
He paid no attention to the people in the restaurant .
It got no better so i had to get up a second time to get more water .
This time however , i was not pleased .
This time , it tasted off ... the fish tasted old and just was not very good .
I should not have to worry if i am going to get sick from eating my lunch .
Had to explain my order 3 different times ( i just did not want soup .
Was not that complicated ) .
We also had to fill our own drinks due to the waitress not paying attention .
That 's not that big of deal , but some service would have been nice .
Not sure what happened here today , usually i love chef be n's .
He apologized but it was not his fault the quality was crap .
Do not waste your time or money
What 's nice is that you do not have to buy a loaf without tasting it first because they offer free sample slices of that day 's breads , with or without butter .
I wanted to really like this place but it just did not do it for me .
We probably will not be coming back anytime soon .
I do not usually give 1 star reviews to burgers .
You can not go wrong with a $ 6.99 burger !!
We ordered a blooming onion and we also ordered the burger to share like always ( portion control and no left overs ) .
We ordered the burger with cheddar cheese and no tomato .
Just to make sure the business was aware ( i am sure they do not taste every item they serve ) i wanted to let the waiter know that it either was burnt or they should test the oil to see if they need to change it .
We did not ask them to , but they were nice enough to even cut the burger in half and put it and the fries on two separate plate !
I took the top bun off to add some salt and pepper and noticed there was no cheese on the burger at all , and there was a big juicy tomato on the burger .... my husband has never been one to complain about his food at a restaurant .
I took the top bun off to add some salt and pepper and noticed there was no cheese on the burger at all , and there was a big juicy tomato on the burger .... my husband has never been one to complain about his food at a restaurant .
Not wanting to upset my husband , we began to eat .
The waiter came around asking how it was , and at that point , i let him know that there was no cheese and he had saw the tomato picked off on the side of my plate .
I was not expecting money to be off my bill , but i was expecting a big apology and a thanks for the heads up that the cooks were not doing their jobs properly ....
I did not get any of the above ...
I do not think we will be going back .
When we told our server that the potatoes were not cooked he told us that the shift likes them aldente .
If i do not make it into trader joe 's every other week , something is wrong .
I am still working up the nerve to try some of the meat selection , which i was told is not very good , but i would like to give it half a chance .
That 's beyond the pale and i will never return .
15 minutes for a cold sandwich when no one is in front of you is too long !
The most disappointing part was the over cooked egg , no runny yolk to cover my plate while i enjoyed it .
It 's probably not " authentic " korean food , but every item on their menu i have tried tasted incredible .
If you have not been here in a while give it a new try .
Horrible need to have your first person be a lot more professional can not understand her voice and asking to repeat rude .
Do not waist your time and money with the company .
For those that never had it , the soup is spicy it has tofu and most places you choice beef or seafood .
You can ask them no spice .
The beef tendon soup is very clean with a clear broth not spicy .
Secondly , my food was not cooked properly and i " thought " the waitress was bringing back a whole new entree .
( not true ! )
Those guys was not causing trouble nor refusing to leave !
Because i have never seen this type of behavior / crazyness from a restaurant .
First of all ... no mistake that this place is actually good --- but not today . :(
There was no flavor like did not have any salt / seasoning .
I know this place has good food because we have eaten here before and did take out once before but maybe these particle items are not so good for take out .
Overall we spent about $ 50 and were not satisfied and just really disappointed because we like to support hawaii restaurants .....
I came to this restaurant because i had heard great things about the pizza , and they certainly did not disappoint .
I do not know her name but she was of a short height and a pretty butch looking girl .
I could not believe the way she treated them and this made me want to get up and leave .
Food was good not great .
She never showed , we paid and left .
Not sure what to make of that ...
Wo n't come again
I do not buy into the trader joes hype to the level that many do .
We went there in a game night , so there was some brutal noise , but we did not mind =)
She did not know how to explain so she got me sample from kitchen !
I am usually not big on chain restaurants .
However i can not help but give the local outback at chandler blvd .
5 . our friends got some cheese fries which looked awesome but i could not eat them because of my diet ( low carb ) .
7 . my drink glass was never empty the entire time .
8 . i was asked if i wanted a box for what i could not eat .
I have to say that i have never received this high level of service from any restaurant anywhere .
If you do not want to wait ... go there for lunch .
We all know tj 's is awesome for it 's uniqueness , so after years of shopping at tj 's ( in 3 states ) and never reviewing them i thought a tried and true tj 's item recipe would be a nice idea : tj 's frozen chicken tenderloins ( sauté in tj 's olive oil and tj 's minced garlic ) add 1 sauteed onion and 1 container tj 's sauteed portobello mushrooms 1 jar tj 's thai curry sauce ( the green sauce ) while you are making the above , make tj 's basmati rice medley and steam tj 's frozen broccoli .
Yes , the parking is not fun , but you should try the one in santa monica , ca !
I go at least 2 - 3 times a month do not miss out ask for darrel !
I am picky when it comes to local food ( born and raised on kauai ) , i do not eat at l&l because i consider it hawaii 's fast food , so when i say i loved this place , i mean i loved it .
The lau lau and kalua pig are perfectly seasoned and not too salty , the mac salad is balanced and not drowned in mayo .
The poi is real poi , not the sweet ' hanalei ' poi .
We went there last night service incredibly slow , some food items never showed up or showed up after we had eaten most of the main entree .
They were not even busy .
Nice place to come for a fix , but there was not anything that jumped out at me enough to make the 30 - minutes drive out here again .
Very laid back , no frills atmosphere to this place with an eclectic menu so i am sure there is something everyone can find to eat here .
Would have liked more options on the entrees , if you are not in the mood for pasta , tough place to eat , limited on other things .
With that said , the macaroni salad did not disappoint .
Mash potato was the shit ... no lie i can probably survive off of it .
The slam still did not look very good , but i had the santa fe skillet , and it was very tasty .
Maybe 2.5 ( like i said , the ' slam ' still did not look appetizing to me ) .
Though it 's still not my first choice of places to come , frankly .
No i wanted to go somewhere to have a nice italian pizza , and not only being italian i love my pizza .
My pizza comes and at first sight i was disappointed , it looked like it came out of a mccains pizza box , it was not thin crust nor did it taste any special .
I would not go there for pizza again .
Not just for the ladies , not to mention , get to wear a robe that will make you feel like magnum p.i. in his down time .
Trust your face and body to lavonna 's magical hands and you will not be disappointed .
Maybe it 's not fair to compare this to any bbq places i 'd visited in s. korea , but it was so far off , it was so bad .
No panchan , lettuce , sesame oil salt , raw garlic , daenjang , etc. kimchi and rice extra ?
I have been to bbq places where they do not serve rice ( korean food are extremely balanced ) but always some fresh lettuce to wrap the meat and kimchi !
The place looked very busy , but there was no waiting for a table .
But add a packed house , several televisions and loud music and you can not hear yourself think , let alone talk to your table mates .
I expected this and it did not bother me at first but my 22 year old son ( who frequents bw3 's which is also loud ) said he would not go back because of it .
This annoys me because an appetizer is not supposed to be served with the entree and there was no room for 5 large plates and 4 small ones on the pub-style table .
He tried doctoring them up and still could not eat them .
It was $ 17 - ish , i think he said , and not worth it at all .
According to him , it was about 20 % fat and not tasty .
However , this boy eats about 4 things total and is very picky so i am not sure how accurate that assessment is .
He also said the fries were super greasy , but his mother does not let him eat a lot of greasy foods so he thought it was great .
I figured i already ate half of them so i did not complain .
We all considered not tipping ( or not tipping much ) but i personally having worked for tips in the past could not bring myself to punish the waitress for the crappy work of the cooks or the fact that she could not hear a damn thing in there .
I guess i would give the place another try if someone wanted to , but would not suggest it .
They were not very busy which was great .
I am glad to say that , when the food is not the focus , they did a good job with service .
Every time i come over on this side of town i must stop and i must get something i do not care beds down to a little tube of honey we are a big loaf or bread this place is absolutely outstanding i love it love it love it love it
As someone who wore contacts and glasses for 20 + years , i can not say enough about how happy i am with my lasik procedure from the wellish vision institute .
The service is not at all good .
I asked for a house red and was told they do not do house wines .
I noticed after i made my order that they had feature wines on a notice board , but i was not told about any .
The food is good but i will not bring anyone i am trying to impress to this location .
It just did not feel special .
Condescending , not very good at quality ...
But until they get rid of the singular tech that is running their company into the ground , their review will not improve .
After investing thousands with this company , i would never return to them again .
They started us off with one basket of bread for the table that was not even enough for one piece each , but they happily replenished each time we were out .
Not sure i would return again just because it was not personally worth it for me .
I would recommend for a quick bite to eat but definitely not for a nice dinner out .
They were kind and did not push any services .
The crab legs were delivered cold and with no krackers .
No refills on drinks .
Somehow the chicken has a great smokey flavor and is not dry like so many other places .
I did not want to make a scene because i was there for a girlfriend 's event but my arm hurt like hell .
I was not able to have the full manicure experience as the paraffin was too hot for my wrist , and again , the manager nor anyone at the spa seem to care .
I am not one to make a fuss , and again , i did not want to ruin my girlfriend 's event - but this was one of the most horrible experiences i have ever had in my life and i was really mad that the manager did not give a damn .
And if you are scared , do not be !
I am sure most of you will know that this is not actually korean bbq .
I can not deny that it 's a fun time with a group of friends .
Some tips : ask for a new grill when your food starts to all taste like burnt stuff when cooking fish , place it on top of a piece of beef so that it does not stick to the grill .
I never felt nervousness and anxious at all .
There was no pain and i felt like it went so fast .
Omg , i do not know where to start .
You can not go wrong .
Third time it was not fresh at all and leaves were wilted and soggy ( which is why i took one star off ) .
I was pretty unhappy about that since i was so excited to eat it before studying only to find it it was not fresh !
I literally can not but then because i can eat those huge cookies by myself :(
They have delicious looking cinnamon rolls which i have not tried yet ( watching my waistline ) , delicious loaves and cookie !
I do not understand why anyone would rate trader joe 's lower than 5 stars , the place is perfect .
I can not believe they have been in madison for about 10 years now .
Not one of them recognize me yet ( no worries ) .
I did not order a lettuce sandwich with pastrami .
The servers act like they do not want tone there .
After exam the back office manager came out ( after 2 times requesting to see her ) to tell us that she 's sorry but that they ca n't control doctor 's timing !?!?
I was very sad that this was not one of the breads at this location , and the only reason i marked this business down a star .
I have not tried any of the sandwiches here , so i can not comment on them , but i imagine they are good on such fresh bread .
I do not understand why the review has two dollar signs because groceries here are relatively inexpensive compared to the same item sold at regular grocery stores .
There are very few items i need to buy at a regular store that trader joe 's does not have .
El peor y nada profesional que vi en mis 64 años , lo tratan tan mal a los pacientes y cobran por lo que no hacen y por lo que se equivocan también , nunca más voy a este wallish deberían quitarle su título para que no pueda atender ni hacer más daño a la gente .
No way !
Went in the other day because i did not want to cook , and after watching " super size me ' " about a month ago , i stay away from the obvious " fast food " restaurants completely .
So , craving some red meat i went to dickeys for take out because it was close and i figured their food would not be as processed as mcd 's - seriously that movie gave me nightmares .
I refused to taste it , and everyone else was brave enough to at least try it , only to decide they could not eat more than 1 bite - but the dog thought it was delicious .
Never tried the potato casserole because dickeys forgot to pack it .
I am not a salt person , but it definitely needed salt and pepper to give it flavor and the macaroni was over cooked to that gross slimy noodle consistency .
So , the 3 of us shared 4 ribs , okra , and an individual size coleslaw with 2 rolls - one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the mac and cheese even though he did not like it .
But i will definitely check my takeout before i leave to make sure it is all there and i will never order the mac and cheese or processed turkey poo again .
Honestly , for uptown , that can not be beat .
From steve uricchio , to todd landis , this amazing dining destination never fails !!!
If there wad i did not see or taste it .
We are both not fans of corn so we chose the baked potato with sour cream and chives .
I asked the gentleman who brought the food out who was not our waiter why we got corn when we asked for a potato with sour cream and chives .
Since it seemed english was not his first language he had our waiter come over .
When we had finished and needed a togo box i tried to waive the waiter down with no luck .
He never said a word .
Not bad , not amazing , i prefer the originally grazie in uptown toronto , it just tastes more fresh and much more attentive service .
I do not often go out of my way to write reviews for places .
Do not come here !!
His attitude was just off putting and we could tell the guy could not possibly care less about the kind of service we were receiving .
Additionally , we did n't get water until after we finished more than half our food , even after we asked more than a hundred times !!
The grill was badly charred halfway through our meal and they never offered to change it , even after our food was clearly getting coated in black residue which made the already sub par food taste like charcoal .
The sides were not great either .
There was no soap !!!
This is not a reasonable place to eat at and you will regret it !
This review is only on customer service not food not happy with them .
The food was ok , the rib eye steak was a little tough and no flavor , the lobster bisque was quite good though .
I mean , you can not really expect high quality on these prices .
Also , it is at the cannery and i do not think they are gunning for a 5 star rating .
I like the fish and peanut side dish , but seem like they do not have it now .
My facial was superb and pedicure was great ( although i can not say it was extraordinarily better than the $ 25 pedicure i normally get ) .
I just wish spas ( not just elizabeth arden ) would not push their product so much at the end of the treatment .
I will not be returning to this denny 's location ever again .
They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience , they have not done so .
I can not recall the last time i saw them brush the sides of our pool .
They do not always empty every basket .
And i have never seen them vacuum the pool floor .
We have called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and did not apologize or see what they could do to improve service .
The creamy tomato sauce is not as creamy as i expected .
I do not like creamy dishes but i enjoyed it .
I will come back again for the food but no comment on service .
Sometimes we do get a good waiter ( our favorite waitress ) , but it s usually the same handful of waiters that do not pay attention .
Wellish 's office i was always greeted with a hello and a smile and never had to wait longer than 5 minutes before being called to the back .
I would not hesitate to recommend dr. wellish to anyone considering lasik .
I got the advanced brightening facial and i have not had to moisturize my face since .
He never missed a beat .
Trust me , the food can be great , but when the service is not up to standards it can ruin the experience .
It 's not often i find this on menus nowadays and it being one of my favorite appetizers i was pleased to see it on the menu .. the escargot was not prepared in the usual butter - garlic - wince sauce .
It 's not often i find this on menus nowadays and it being one of my favorite appetizers i was pleased to see it on the menu .. the escargot was not prepared in the usual butter - garlic - wince sauce .
Not your typical soup you 'd find on a menu .
Not that i mind , but this is the sort of soup you want to enjoy for yourself .
For those who may not have had the same experience , my only suggestion is to try them again .
Their egg rolls are the best and at .99 for 3 during lunch time you can not beat that price .
I will say i was not overly impressed with their sushi but i only tried it once a long time ago because i do not come here when i specifically want sushi .
If you want the " all you can eat " option , everyone at the table has to get it , so that there is no sharing if food that you did not order .
I told our server that we had never done this before , and asked for advice on how to " do this " .
You can not tell a bunch of black people from south carolina to do whatever they want because they will move into your house after that !
That little bit of food was gone in no time .
If you do not like your food at a place like this , who can you blame ?
The last couple orders had food left off and even food on it that we did not request .
The service was not great , but they remained polite and professional though they were often inattentive .
Just do not be surprised if they have changed the ayce rules since we left .
Do not drive by this local joint !
I am never disappointed when i go to waverly 's .
The food is delicious and i love the fact that i do not have to go on the strip to get it !
Came here from la to get my hair cut and styled for a friend 's wedding and could not be any happier .
Never seen a restaurant like this in toronto .
Absolutely not recommended .
First let me say i will never come back to this place and they jacked my coach sunglasses !!
It was good but not spectacular .
This was not a place i 'd ever go back .
It seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing .. one of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread .. um ..
As we left there was an elderly couple walking in , i said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are too complicated for them to make and they have been working since 5 ( she said it , me .. so this was not an insult , just a disclaimer i was passing along )
You really should try it out if you have not already done so .
I live upstairs in the condo beside , i have been here a few times and servers pretend to not see you when you put your hand up .
I do not recommend this place .
My pool has never worked better .
The salad i got was not bad .
When it comes to dinner time , they should not serve lunch sized portions to hungry ppl .
Nice to go there when they run specials , or expect a pricier menu ... not sure why the entire casino can not be run the way waverley 's is ...
I have though is that they do not have an habenero or extra hot sauce .
They also do not give you very many celery sticks with the wings .
We have liked this denny 's before but this time the waitress was just plain rude which we were willing to look past but then to not have either of the deserts we chose made this a bad trip to denny 's .
First - we have never had a bad meal .
I can not tell you the best attribute of waverlys because the food , atmosphere and people make this a perfect dining experience .
2 ) 3 hour pre-op testing 3 ) 1 hour lasik surgery 4 ) 1 hour day - after post - op 5 ) 1 hour week - after post - op 6 ) 1 hour month - after post - op so as you can see , if you do not have a flexible schedule this will be very annoying to the other people in your life that have to adjust to your 6 appointment times all within a month .
My husband was lucky and these affected no one , however i have 25 clients and a 2 year old that all depend on me being at a certain place at a certain time .
No , of course not .
I am in there no more than a minute when a cell phone alarm of church bells starts ringing for 5 consecutive minutes .
My anxiety is now through the roof as i blindly ( because i am not wearing my glasses ) feel my way out of the room and into an employee break room to shut the darn thing off .
I got bubbles under my flaps which had to be smoothed out , which was not at all fun .
I was beyond upset that they could not be bothered to meet my very simple request .
A full week later , i have 20 / 25 vision , which is not yet perfect .
You never meet him until moments before he slices your cornea open and shoots beams of lasers into your retina .
He 's ok with last minute schedule changes , not abiding by his own cell phone policy , and disregarding patients simple requests .
He would not know who i was if i passed him on the street tomorrow , and he did my surgery a week ago .
This office never runs on time and has no respect for their patient 's calendar or time .
Always at lease one hour late with no explanation .
Also , although they say it is " korean bbq " the chain is actually chinese owned and the bbq here is not authentic korean bbq .
Authentic korean bbq has much higher grade meat and is generally not ayce .
However , if you are on a date or want a nice classier dinner , this is definitely not the place to be as you will smell like grease and your stomach will feel horrible afterwards .
The service here is mediocre , it is not amazing yet they are not generally horrible .
It was a problem for us getting the attention of one of the servers as they do not constantly come and ask if everything is ok or not , you have to call them down ( in typical chinese restaurant fashion ) .
The decor is quite nice and the place is large enough to fit a lot of people but it is not overly popular unlike other restaurants around the area .
In short , come here only if you are craving all you can eat greasy meat and do not mind the low quality cooking .
Do not expect a nice , classy dinner with a date , this place is just a lot of fun cooking and hanging out with a large group of friends .
Please also be aware that not only is the place unsanitary , the tips that you leave will not be distributed to your respective waiters and waitresses .
This is not your typical healthy eating store .
Only 5 stars , just because i can not give them 7 !
I as pretty sold at the moment , but told her as a personal rule , i do not make impulse decisions and would have to go meet with at least one other professional to be able to make a sound comparison .
Not going to name any names , but i met with a couple other professionals in town , they did not even come close to the quality of service , and scale that the wellish vision institute has .
Never waited more than 15 minutes , not once was greeted by someone that did not have a smile on their face .
Procedure lasted not longer than 10 minutes in my opinion , ( have not asked ) but i remember asking dr wellish , that 's it , are you really done ?
I do not know what else can i say , one of the best investments i have ever made .
In hindsight i probably should have asked him for a referral and not went to yelp , but i guess i probably would have ended up here anyways .
We sent back the hash browns as they obviously could not be eaten and they came out at 9:45 with one side cooked .
The waitress just apologized but did not tale anything off the bill .
Also our toast was not even warm .
Do not apologize - fix the problem .
Toast was not delivered with the meal .
Still no toast .
Told her to take it back and i did not want anything to eat .
It was not even busy .
Did not even get a sorry from the waitress when i paid for my wife 's breakfast .
The bread with rock hard , everyone was commenting how it was so crusty that it felt like it was cutting your gums and the roof of your mouth after the server initially brought us water , it never occurred to him or the other assistants they had to replenish the water or offer refills ... even though they walked by and constantly glanced at our tables 10 to 15 times .
It was not bad and it was not something to come home about .
To be perfectly honest , it s not anything you could not make at home .
When i asked him if he could correct the bill his words are he could not handle the corrections and he could not handle splitting it it according to what it needed to be split .
No offense buddy , but when you are automatically making 18 % gratuity i do not think clicking on a screen here and there is too much work .
Does not make any sense to me and based on that and they re mediocre food none of us will be coming back .
You will find yourself surrounded by high school and college students who probably never had authentic korean bbq before .
If you are keen to enjoy authentic korean bbq , this is not the place .
A month later i am still seeing 20/20 or better and could not be any happier .
We have not been here in 4 or 5 months and i will never go back there ever again .
There were no utensils , barely any ketchup in the bottles on the tables .
My husband only ate a few bites of his food when he found a piece of some kind of plastic wrap in it and then when i went into the restroom to wash my hands , someone had been smoking cigarettes in there i could not even breath it was so bad .
We left , never to return .
Great for times when you do not feel like cooking and just want a quick meal .
You can not beat that .
I did not care too much for the chicken teriyaki though .
We have been going to waverly 's for many , many years and have never had a bad meal .
No reservation for dinner .
And when i called back , they said that they could not come back into next tuesday !
Could not even bump me up to the top of the list .
No apologies or nothing .
Spoke to the manager mike and he was very condescending and was even cussing when i requested to be bumped to an earlier appointment since they are not able to fix my problem after coming out twice .
No issues with the fix or warranty , so we started weekly pool service on our very simple play pool .
Cons : high turn over , poor customer service on the phone or in person - example : said the tech was at our house on friday at 237 pm , as u can see in our picture taken at 4 pm , no baskets were cleaned .
Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until monday afternoon to take a look at our pool that their person turned green .
Overall , if you actually see a tech show up they are here for less than 5 minutes , never the same one , do nt complete the tasks they advertise for $ 80 / month and you will be disappointed by the customer service you recieve when you call the office .
We gave them a valiant effort & thousands of dollars but highly highly do not recommend & it s time to move on .
I can not say how much i love this small sushi and asian restaurant .
I never have to wait they are always fast & friendly .
I do not know if that 's even a compliment .
The broth was a bit too salty , maybe too much bouillon cubes in there , i am not sure .
The oxtail was a bit hard , and was not as soft and tender as i had hoped .
Been to this korean grill house a few times , but never have been so disappointed .
My past experiences here , were not fantastic but never horrible .
Overall , i never thought i 'd say i would be disappointed enough to never go back to a restaurant but this might have been the last push overboard .
A good , not great prenatal massage .
Can not comment on the food as we never got any .
No one ever even came to the table , so we left .
The sweet sauce they drizzle over the roll is not a favorite of mine , it kind of messes with the sushi taste i think .
I have not tried their cooked plated entree 's so i can not speak for that .
Our server was not very attentive , forgot what we ordered , brought our food out without silverware and took several minutes to provide us with silverware so that we could actually eat , and failed to refill our drinks .
Once we were finally able to eat our food , it was a ) cold from us not getting silverware for a few minutes and the restaurant being crazy cold & b ) not that great .
If the food and service was not enough to leave a bad impression , the restrooms were disgusting and there was no toilet paper .
I will definitely not be returning to french quarter ... which is a shame because they are in a primo location !
We did not enjoy at all , unless you are 6 feet tall or higher .
I was served right away did not have to wait very long for food to come out .
Kalua pig was good , lau lau was a little dry , squid luau did not have the sweet coconut taste and the luau leaf was not cooked long enough .
I would not try the hawaiian plate again but i did try the mahimahi sandwich and it was crispy in the outside and moist in the inside .
I just would not go out of my way to visit .
You really can not beat the quality , quantity and satisfaction levels you get .
As a kicker it 's only $ 9 , much less than competitors around the area that are not as delicious and give you less .
I also really enjoy their pan fried fish ( do not remember what it 's called ) .
Ok , our server was fine , no problem with that .
I did not complain coz i do not want to make a scene , nor for them to recook coz the kids are starving at this point .
I am surprised manager or owner does not notice these things and insist that everything get a thorough cleaning !
Not appetizing .
It was only after about 10 mins when i walked up to the front to see what was happening with the table we were told ' i am waiting for people to finish their dessert and then you will have your table ' a quick look around and i noticed no one was eating dessert .
We decided to leave and all six of us walked by him and he did not say a word .
No thank you .
First impressions were not great i will say this now .
The portions seemed small , especially considering the price , but do not be fooled because by the end of it i could not have another bite if i 'd wanted to .
The bibimbap was nice and hot packed with all the goodies and the don katsu was rather tender unlike most other places ( the sauce was pretty subpar and they do not give you enough rice though ) .
I 'd suggest getting the non-bbq dishes as you get more bang for your buck however if you have got the money to spend and looking for some good grilling you can not go wrong here .
I ate here twice with a group and loved the salad as you choose what you want on it and it it 's cut the way you want so you do not end up with lettuce hanging out of your mouth and i added salmon of course .
He was professional , communicated in a great manner , was timely and not only did outstanding work , but provided great counsel .
Actually though , i have not visited a trader joe that was not great !
I love eating vietnamese food and have vietnamese friends back home who cooked for me growing up , so moving here and not having as much was pretty sad .
The marinade on the london broil was outstanding , my salad dressing rocked , the tzatziki sauce is absolutely the best i have ever tasted , it was so fresh and cucumbery , the feta was like goat cheese , real greek olives , and even my peppercinni was uniquely the best , some kind of spice was on it , cucumbers nice chunks with no after burp .
I stumbled on this place by chance and will definitely make the drive into charlotte deliberately for the french quarter , as long as there 's not a game , lol .
My water was never empty , and the service was stellar !!
I was so excited to proceed and could not wait for the day of surgery to come !
The surgery was not what i expected , i went in afraid and found out there is nothing to be afraid of !
It 's not the greatest food you will ever eat but this location has a very friendly staff and very clean environment .
I like bbq , but you can tell employees and management do not care about quality ....
Never mind that we do not know the exact provenance of branded items , with bags of " designer " salad at less than $ 3 , who has time for trivial questions ?
The general manager did not want hear that we was talking to our friends at a nearby table and not " hovering over " the the white couple 's table .
We spoke with the police on the outside of the restaurant and advised them what happened and the officers could not believe that they were called out to hickory tavern harris corners pkwy for that bogus call .
I will never patronized with hickory tavern again until they make this right with me and my friends .
I am not sure what management training the general manager went through to prepare him for that role , however , he failed in a major way .
Corporate has no idea what the public wants .
My final surgical result was excellent when settled and i did not need glasses for any activity .
( it was stable at around 20/25-30 for 14 years and dr w had offered to re-do at no charge if i wanted that 20/15 - 20 result ) .
15 years after surgery his office forwarded my surgical records to my local cataract surgeon at no extra charge .
Not amused .
Not fantastic but not bad either .
Went there because chilis was too crowded , only regret was they did not serve beer .
I had the california club and do not remember what my wife 's sandwich was called .
The entire experience could not have gone any better .
I never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to be called in from the waiting area .
No way .
Waitress not very attentive after that .
Matter of fact she never came back .
We were not happy with the burgers coming out more well done than medium but they were not horrible either just a burger .
Overall , we will give this another try since our service was great and good was not horrible .
And when i called back , they said that they could not come back into next tuesday !
Could not even bump me up to the top of the list .
No apologies or nothing .
Spoke to the manager mike and he was very condescending and was even cussing when i requested to be bumped to an earlier appointment since they are not able to fix my problem after coming out twice .
Update : why would i want you to come back again , when you could not fix the problem after 2 visits , which i had to wait 5 days total for ?
Plus you did not offer next day free , you said if there was a cancellation before next week , then i might could get a visit and that " i should be thanking you " for even getting that .
People do not complain about great service , but crappy service is a great motivator .
However the massage therapist did not perform a deep tissue massage at all .
I am always bad at face to face confrontation so i was not able to tell them this was probably one of the worst deep tissue massages i ever received .
Horrible service , i have no idea what their food tastes like - on saturday , i was running and errand and decided to stop in and grab a menu from dickey 's .
They were frustrated because no one had come to the counter to take their order .
Apparently , the employee who took our order had gone home for the night and never put in our order .
We were so disappointed after the experience we will not be back and after reading the reviews i do not think we are missing much .
No issues with the fix or warranty , so we started weekly pool service on our very simple play pool .
Cons : high turn over , poor customer service on the phone or in person - example : said the tech was at our house on friday at 237 pm , as u can see in our picture taken at 4 pm , no baskets were cleaned .
Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until monday afternoon to take a look at our pool that their person turned green .
Overall , if you actually see a tech show up they are here for less than 5 minutes , never the same one , do nt complete the tasks they advertise for $ 80 / month and you will be disappointed by the customer service you recieve when you call the office .
We gave them a valiant effort & thousands of dollars but highly highly do not recommend & it s time to move on .
*** if below comment from mike is referring to our call with the secretary monday morning it was anything but pleasant considering how long we have been customers .. snarky & disappointing was more like it & the only discount offered was to not pay for last week when the tech clearly either no - showed or did nothing at our house **
Great atmosphere , and have never been disappointed !
I would prefer not to rate with stars & just disclose the facts thus far .
Fee does not include 3 types of eye drops to start @ approx .
Still can not see .
Still can not see . * 3rd apt. i still can not see .
Still can not see . * 3rd apt. i still can not see .
Not safe & i am hoping to find a resolution to get back to life .
I was greeted by a less than friendly cashier who not once offered me a slice of bread .
No biggie since i would have declined anyway but not to be offered ... strange .
I got it with basil mayo but it was so scarce i could not taste it - not one bit .
Let me tell you ... they are not to be found at this store !
Not inedibly hard but just not the soft sugar cookies that , in my book , made gh my most favorite cookie stop .
To add insult to injury , i get all the back to work and realize that i never got my drink !
I have never really had to wait for a table at this location .
But really , if you have never tried the baked goat cheese salad , i urge you to try it at least once .
If you do not like it , send it my way :)
We were sat , 3 adults 1 child , waited for 10 minutes and no one even came by to give us a drink .
Needless to say i was not waiting any longer .
It was not too loud in there or anything so we were all able to talk and hear each other okay .
We did not get around to it because we had 3 at our table but yeah .
As a breakfast snob i really do not like denny 's .
They do not really do anything especially well .
I can not slam this place for one unpleasant waitress , but i can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better .
The food took forever , it was not well done , came out all screwed up , and the waitress was unpleasant .
After that experience i decided to never set foot in another denny 's .
They did not repair the job and then made it worse we had to call another pool company to fix their problem .
I do not understand the bad reviews here ?
I love trader joe 's , but this one is just not that great .
If you ask why , the people who work there will not know either .
3 ) prices are not consistent with other tj locations !
5 ) employees do not offer to help you / check that you are finding everything ok .
Given issue number 2 , i typically am in need of assistance hunting down something / figuring out why it 's no longer in stock and have sometimes spent minutes following a tj employee around the store to ask for help !
This store is definitely not the store to come to for your one - stop grocery needs .
One evening my two young boys were making a mess and i could not eat a bite of food without stopping to clean something up .
The young woman who was serving us put her hand on mine as i picked something up and said , " do not worry about it .
Tonight 's your night to not cook or clean .
I take all my friends here for late night snacks and honestly i have not met anyone yet that has not liked the food here , it s just that good !!
Also , it s one of the very few restaurants in toronto that carries bibimnaengmyun all year round , which is awesome because its delicious no matter the weather and the sauce here is the best ( i recommend ordering extra sauce on the side ) .
Not a burger .
Not a chicken - fried steak .
It was not fancy .
It was not as good as it sounds .
Not bad .
But not as good as it sounds like it should be .
I used to patronize great harvest regularly but not so much these days .
They have a " light wheat " bread , which sounds like reduced - calorie ( does not it ? ) but turns out to be half white and half wheat .
That was not fun to walk through , but whatever .
The food was just not completely up to par .
As for the entrees , the ribeye was cooked nice , but was not seasoned enough .
Officially 3 1 / 2 stars , but since i can not do that , i am trending downwards .
Some combination of delirium from hunger ( i had not eaten a solitary real food , unless wheatgrass and jerky are real foods ) and general anger from having to work an actual full day on a friday compelled me to wings .
There did not seem to be a hostess or host to greet you at the door , and the bar was full , which is to be expected for a friday happy hour .
Do not get me wrong , i was satisfied with it , but i have to note that they add this steak sauce .
The first bite was remarkable , full of flavors that my brain was not ready to experience .
I know i did not dislike the sauce , but i also felt like i could very quickly grow tired of it .
I do not know why that caught my eye , but i appreciate art installations , so bonus points .
I will admit , the crispness , the size , the flavor despite their simplicity ( not to mention how well they pair with that funky funky cheese sauce ) make these some solid a to a- wings , but i will need a bigger sample size before i can crown them .
I am always skeptical of french / cajun restaurants but this one did not even try !
Sorry .... not falling for the trick .
I was nice about it , i guess that happenes ( not at the good places , but still happens ) .
At the end was not even offered a discount ... pretty shitty move .
Will never go to this location after talking to the owner on the phone .
I knew they did not take reservations on the weekend but wanted to see if they would make an exception since we were a large group and it was a milestone birthday ( knew the chances were slim ) .
Instead what i was told was how large groups are not of value to them as they do not make as much money and that they are in the business of flipping tables and doing volume so do not care about groups and do not even want groups !
Any owner that basically says to their customer that they are not as valuable as they are only focused on making as much money as possible makes me seriously question how they run the rest of their business .
So if you do not want to support a business that treats their customers like they are just numbers , then join me in boycotting this establishment .
I appreciate it and try to take advantage of this great offer to visit spas throughout the valley of the sun that i normally would not have thought to schedule with .
( i am not a fan of head massages or scalp rubs though and will mention it next time , was too blissed out to care ) .
Insider tip : never schedule your appointments on a friday evening or a saturday .
I only wish i was closer :( ... you do have to get their attention a lot to keep your food coming but that is no big deal .
It 's fun cooking your meat and the prices are not bad at all .
The meatballs were not very good .
The hand cut fries were disappointing as they had no salt on them .
When our food arrived the lunch special was not as the waitress had described .
She then got mad when we had told her that this is not what we ordered and she was very rude .
The bald guy at the register was very rude and was not friendly at all .
He has no facial expressions when you greet him or will ignore you when speaking to him .
All in all bad experience will never go back due to the rude staff .
No real stand out complaints but no real stand out praises either .
Was surprised the fire alarm was not going off .
It was not really busy on a mid week evening and the 2 bartenders did not really seem to have much of a clue .
I would not go back .
So , i attempt to place my order online with my ipad through grub hub and the grub hub website does not allow me to add items to my order .
I will never support this business .
Mitch from dickey 's could not have been more supportive and helpful , especially when it was discovered we did not have the proper sized chafing dishes , which he helpfully loaned us .
We 'd no call , thursday no call i called thursday evening keep in mind it does not take long for a pool to turn green .
I did not get a call from them this friday morning so i called again .
I do not see it .
No coffee refills .
No flavored coffee creamer .
Never again .
You will not miss this restaurant as you walk along queen street from university westbound .
So be prepared to dress appropriately so that you will not leave the place with the bbq smell on your body the whole night .
Mainly , we ai not much for puttin ' rubs on the meat .
Not overly smokey .
No fat in sight .
Not pre-sauced .
And it just plain was not smoky enough .
Real smoked turkey is smokey , smokey and not a whole helluva lotta moisture .
With fried okra there 's no gray area .
A lot of my friends complain about bad service , but i have never had a single bad experience ( and i have been here a lot ) .
Details : ambience : dimly lit , clean stainless steel everywhere , nice , cozy , warm - there 's nothing you will not like about the ambience .
I do not really care about variety at kgh because i go for the beef , pork and chicken and all three come yummily marinated .
Not particularly , but it is a solid option if you are in the mood for that type of fare , good for family , friends , work , the game , etc .
Needless to say i could not risk an infection so we stopped the pedi and just did a nail color change .
I was so looking forward to this then i was charged $ 34 on top of all this , and never did get a pedi .
Have passed by grazie a million times , and was never interested in going inside .
The lovely interior does not match the exterior , and i am glad that i gave it a try .
I was not feeling too hungry so i ordered the soup of the day which was kale with italian sausage .
After we ordered the food took forever to come out and it was not busy .
Michael was pretty quick in diagnosing the problem which unfortunately was a melted piece stuck in the motor that was causing the motor not to work .
Not a fan of low - carb , no - carb , smart - carb , whatever - carb ?
The supermarket variety does not cut it !!!
It probably will not seem too spectacular at first , but trust ... it aint subway !
Does no one eat at home in woodbridge ?
Not with places like this ......
Most of the waiters did not seem as welcoming .
I asked for sesame oil and salt and the guy did not know what i was talking about .
They do not rush you out of the place , we were almost there for three hours .
The flavor was right on just no green onions or tofu .
Bill of two for an appetizer - 2 steaks - no dessert - and 2 glasses of house wine came to $ 111 .
This had to be done for spite - manager would not come to the table until after the steak was removed and offered to comp the appetizer .
Do not gamble your dollars on this place .
I am praying we do not all get sick .
The sauce station has not been cleaned in who knows how long .
The workers could not care less that the place was a wreck .
Do not go to this restaurant .
Please god do not let us all get sick tonight .
*** edited to add : i am a long time yelp reader but never post ( just not my thing ) i actually created an account tonight because this was so bad .
Why oh why did not we ?
And previous reviewer was right on about the sinks not working etc .
The only thing i did not love was the sauvignon potatoes , which were slightly undercooked .
While not the most amazing dining experience , it was a solid meal and a pleasant experience , and i would happily return .
It was 4 items and they could not even get it right .
I will not be going back .
Never a disappointment !
Todd land is the manager goes above and beyond not only for his customers but he is a great manager to his staff !
The value at waverly 's is never a question .
We were seated right upon walking in with no waiting time and within seconds side dishes were being placed around us .
We were not too crazy on the pork or squid .
They were not bad but the clear winners were the chicken and beef .
They never rushed us and my girlfriend and i were there for nearly 2 hours !
I really like this one , and often order it when i am not feeling red meat .
We have never utilized it , but you can take advantage of their online ordering and curbside pickup .
You can order steak , chicken , and seafood , all for prices that are not going to break the bank .
Will not return .
I ordered a cold turkey sandwich and received a hot grilled one that was not good because the turkey over powered the bread and it had way too much of the sauce they used .
I would not go back to this place .
That works for me as i typically do not eat the rice ( or have a bite .
I am not getting younger after all ) .
While not my favorite korean spot ever , most certainly worth visiting .
Lots of great items you can not find anywhere else and all for great prices !
Dr. wellish did my lasik about a year ago and i have never been any happier with my vision since .
Even though i had very high astigmatism i do not require readers or glasses at night .
This place was a surprise saw them on a previous trip to the starbucks next door , and made a mental note of were they where ( we do not live near here but go to ejs auctions down the street .
I love the generous samples ; i have ended up getting things i would not have normally chosen like the cherry white chocolate bread .
It did not sound good to me but i tried a sample and it is good !
If you are not familiar with trader joe 's , they sell mostly their own products .
However , it 's reasonably priced because of the way they buy ( which also means they may not stock your favorite thing the next time you go in there ) .
Before i had shopped at a tjs , i thought it would be way overpriced like w.f. really , it 's not .
So , you simply can not expect to go into one and find every thing on your list .
It just does not work that way .
But i usually check there first and you get to know what they have and do not have as far as habitual purchases go .
I am thinking the guerilla critic might have been guilty of a case of mistaken identity ( as well as multiple class a federal felonies : ( while dickies dogs made serviceable hot dogs , you really can not say the same about the " barbecue " from dickeys pit .
I met a friend at dickeys pit yesterday for lunch and a business meeting ... from the moment i walked in , i just sort of knew it was not going to go well for dickeys pit :(
When they talk about how they make their " barbecue " at dickeys , they talk about how they " cook " their meats " on the pit " overnight ... wait a minute ... that 's not barbecue !
At any rate , i was there and i was starving ( power yoga and no breakfast make for an empty boy : ) so i went ahead and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with " barbecue " beans .
They brought out my sandwich , which had been " cooked on the pit " ... sliced pork shoulder ( not pulled pork ) without so much as a hint of smoke , served with watery beans that had more in common with bean soup than with real barbecue beans ... except without the flavor of good bean soup : ( they have serve yourself barbecue sauce and i got regular and spicy sauce ( the sweet sauce was almost like candy : ( ... and i slathered the spicy on my sandwich in an unsuccessful effort to get some flavor into the meat .
It was just a sliced pork sandwich with second rate barbecue sauce poured over the top ... it was not barbecue , pit or otherwise and it was not good : ( the place is clean , modern , family friendly , pretty cheap and completely without redeeming value when it comes to the food they serve .
They were already halfway into dinner service and they let me know that the service was horrible and no one really understood english .
I was not going for the all you can eat so we asked the waiter for a menu so i could order an item from their dinner menu .
The dinner itself , surprisingly , was not too long of a wait and i decided on the beef bibimbap , which was very tasty and i demolished the whole thing myself .
Little did they know that ice cream was not included in ayce and you have to pay an extra $ 2 something to order ice cream ( which only consisted of chocolate , strawberry , vanilla , green tea and red bean ) .
Korean grill house will probably be my last resort for last minute cravings for korean bbq , the food is delicious do not get me wrong .
The only downside is that they do not serve soup after 10 pm lol .
Lol i asked the restaurant if i could exchange it , and they said no because the owner said i already ordered it , which is not the way they should have handled it .
No waiting at all , but my rolls were small , not sure if that 's only on the happy hour menu .
Both of these places either do not carry these items , or they are priced towards the expensive end .
Trader joe 's is not as expensive as i anticipated it to be .
I will continue shopping at trader joe 's for the things that i can not get else where .
Beef , vegetables , and fish not so much on my list .
I figured life is too short to not be about to wake up in the morning and not have put on contacts or reach for my glasses .
Keep up the good work , hawaiian shirts and local foods , and you will stay in my heart , wallet and never be boo'ed .
The ingredients do not sound like they fit together but the flavor explodes in your mouth !!
Wines are pretty high in my opinion but draft beers are not bad .
Do not go expecting anything fancy .
Tuna app was decent but no mistaking it for sushi quality .
Not a bad option when in this area ......
The food may be pretty good here , but i will never know because their door was locked .
Do not go !
No , would you like to wait , no nothing ... not the first time the ambivalent nature of service at this location has reared it s ugly head , but it will be the last !
We found ourselves having to ask at least twice for anything and if he had forgotten we did not bother asking again .
I would also strongly advise to not sit downstairs .
The automated e-mail that reminded me of the appointment asked me to be 15 minutes early for paperwork , but they still had not opened .
Lmao. my eye sight is pretty bad , and when taylor broke the news to me about not being able to go through with lasik , i was not surprised .
All i can say is i got my wife a massage package for christmas last year and she has not stopped talking about it .
However our server was unscrupulous by not announcing the prices of the daily specials .
Friendly reminder that it was not lasik , but the alternative prk ' cause of really bad eyesight and astigmatism .
So ... do not forget to double - check your packets / folders and fill that stuff out !
It was not a painful recovery .
As for wait time , i am going to admit that it can take a while sometimes , but i have got no gripe ' cause of how nice and informative the staff is .
It s not the same .
No downsides to that .
You will not find a gourmet meal at the french quarter .
We could hear the people in the kitchen laughing and joking . meanwhile , the place had dirty dishes and no one to check us out .
I ordered pasta with shrimp and it was not good .
It did not have much flavour either .
I would not return here .
Well that never happened .
I recently called since pool season is around the corner and they will not fix it because it 's been past 90 days and it 's not in their notes that anyone was supposed to come out so not their problem because he does not live at my house ( his words ) .
I will never do business with them , nor recommend them to anyone .
I wish i could give aaron pools a negative star rating because they do not even deserve a 0 .
Mike treated me like i was stupid and did not want to listen to anything i had to say .
He was very combative and arrogant , not wanting to help me with my problem .
He seemed very lazy and told me a bunch of different answers that did not make sense .
They told me it was an easy fix and mike 's answers did not make sense .
And do not even try to report a problem to the manager .
She did not to listen to me or help me at all .
I have never been disappointed .
Left a dangerous condition which thankfully was not worse .
Due to improper electrical connections to the pump number one , wire was not grounded on inside of pump , two , wire housing connected to the pump was taped with electrical tape come to find out this was because the tube was broken so they hid that by taping it rather than fixing it and telling us it was an extra precaution .
Thankfully there was not a major house fire and our other pool equipment was not damaged as far as we know .
It was not completely full , as there were at least 15 empty tables / booths .
Ask for jessica as your server if she 's not available ask for justin .
I found out about this place when i first moved here but never got around to trying it until finally last week !
I do not like anyone hovering over me especially when i am in a new place and want to explore it !
I have never seen such beautiful looking bread in my life !
I can not wait to come back and try other stuff !
I do not know if he is the only guy or one of many .
I never knew !
And then ... i can not even really describe it really .
He was really condescending and alternated between treating me like an uninformed child or some kept , trophy wife woman who has not a clue how the world works .
It felt like he mocked me for being concerned about money ( the other place i am going to is $ 400 cheaper ) and then started talking about how i can not see lasek the same way i would a " mommy makeover " or " breast augmentation . "
What those have in common with eye surgery , i do not know , and the fact that those were the examples he gave just solidified my thought that this guy is a creep .
It 's too bad , too , because i was really considering the wellish institute based off their reviews , but i did not want to deal with mr .
It was not that oily because the shape of the cooking pot curved inwards , so the oil was drained out pretty quickly .
Regular flavour is not too spicy .
I am not really big on chains and growing up i never liked denny 's , and i have even gotten an upset stomach from going to certain denny 's .
Their food is always fresh and fast , the service is always great , and i have never felt at all sick after eating here .
My family and i will never step foot in another outback steakhouse again . - it took 2 hours to eat and get out of there and there were only 6 customers in the entire restaurant - it took 40 min to get our onion blossom appetizer - their restaurant smelled like dirty , damp , rags - menus were sticky - ordered the steak and lobster dish and the size of the steak was smaller than the palm of my hand and i have small hands !
Not the most specific , but really every meal i have had here has been good !
I do not think you can really go wrong !
I was not sure what they were trying to be as they had pub fair , greek , mexican , creole / southern ... it was just an odd mix and right away that had me wondering .
Let me first say i am a harsh critic of wings ( having lived in buffalo ) - but salt & pepper was not exactly buffalo style so i thought these could stand a chance .
( the ranch paired with it was great though ) - i decided to ask for some buffalo sauce as i did not want to be eating globs of ranch .
All in all i think i will branch out and try something else next time - but i was not disappointed ..
Also , it was cheap - $ 15 dinner for two , really can not beat that .
Certainly not healthy eating but oh so good .
I had an issue with my pump motor not starting after a rain storm several weeks ago .
He took the time to go above and beyond to answer questions about the pool , and repaired a couple of things that i pointed out that were not in the original ticket , in a couple of minutes .... fast forward two weeks - pump stopped working entirely , called home warranty back , who got ahold of aaron pools , who again , contacted me immediately , and scheduled a time that was convenient for me .
I do not understand some of the other reviews - perhaps they should review their customers ?
Not too bothersome and just the bare minimum .
I just did not feel a wow factor .
I liked that they gave an ample amount of bok choy in the soup but otherwise it was not anything special .
There was not hassle and i appreciate that it was close to school , but otherwise i probably would not come here .
But , because the store is not very large sometimes there are inventory issues .
I did not even have to see or pay the bill !
I have not been to eards in probably about 10 years since a need to correct a terrible pixie cut .
Never work with these people !!!
Unprofessional , ignorant , do n't know what they are doing .
No one contacted us after to tell us what is going on .
When we called them that same day the only thing they said " your warranty will not cover .
Pay us $ 65 for the visit . " we said that we would pay whatever warranty does not cover and please let us know the estimate .
I mean , why technician did not check to give the quote in the first place , right ?
Anyway we do not like conflict so said please go back and give us the quote .
He went to our house , parked outside , never we nt back to the pool ( we had a guest in the house that whole week , so we knew for sure what happened ) .
When we had all the parts he worked on the pool and left saying not to turn on the pump for a couple of hours .
When we did turn on the pump -- the problem that we had was not fixed .
But when we tried to reach him he just never picked up the phone and when we called the company they were extremely rude and said they will not do anything unless we pay ( for still not fixed pool ??? ) and that they would just sue us if we do not pay .
But when we tried to reach him he just never picked up the phone and when we called the company they were extremely rude and said they will not do anything unless we pay ( for still not fixed pool ??? ) and that they would just sue us if we do not pay .
So really , never hire them !!
I thought the pho was good , but the broth was not very tasty .
I do not love the meatballs , so i was happy to see they have an option with only thing beef , tendons and tripe ( my favorite items from the pho dac biet ) .
I tried dolsot bibimbab and kimchi stew and could not finish neither .
With that said , i think we can all pretty much agree that this is not and will hever be the kind of place where you will do all your shopping .
The help here is definitely not as attentive as they are in other places but that does not take aware from my love of this place .
Not costco status by any means but a little something to snack on it always popping in the back .
My coworker brought some sushi from this place on my lunch break and it was not that bad .
I had about four or five different rolls and only one of them i did not like .
The quality was not too bad only one of them had fish and the fish was decent .
They have an outside seating area which is cute and so many specials during the week , you will never get bored :)
Came here on a tuesday at like 5:30 am since me and my boyfriend could not sleep and wanted korean stew . flies everywhere and the side dishes did not seem fresh .
Came here on a tuesday at like 5:30 am since me and my boyfriend could not sleep and wanted korean stew . flies everywhere and the side dishes did not seem fresh .
Really did not enjoy the meal .
Mind you , we sat next to the computer system where the servers punch in , so we saw servers quite frequently , but never our server .
Cons : there is a covered parking lot connected to the main entrance - this is city parking and not free .
Unless you do not mind your produce wrapped in plastic - they have got lots of that .
The squid and octopus are perfectly battered ( not too much ) and not overly salty .
The sea food is fresh and never rubbery .
We always come back to this place to enjoy authentic italian food and are never disappointed .
My expectations were not very high when i tried this place what with it being in the cannery ( a casino way off the strip ) , but to say i was surprised is a huge understatement !
This ai not a super fancy place .
The side dishes are okay ( kinda not fresh because its 24 / 7 place ) .
It was not very busy yet we still waited quite some time for anyone to get to us .
Asked for ranch & honey mustard & did not get that until we were both about done with our meals .
I have actually never been to an outback .
I wish it was not only seasonal .
If this is happening on a daily basis why would you not be more prepared and have more on stock ?
No one came to check on me or apologize for running late .
Not very busy surprisingly , which made it strange that no one payed attention to the fact that it was 20 minutes past my appoinment time and had not been taken back .
I again inquired at the front desk and was told he was still with the clients whose appoinment proceeded mine , and they had no eta on when he would be done .
No offer to find someone else to cut my hair , just an " i am sorry . "
I will not be going back to red door at biltmore .
Service - two girls short handed with no leadership seems like whole staff hides in kitchen good beer selection
Simple korean favourites at affordable prices , with floor seats ( think cushions down and no shoes ) or regular seats .
If you are not into the casualness , it may be a huge culture shock , but otherwise it 's a great spot for a small group !
The rice cakes were tasty - though i could not have many due to my weak spice tolerance .
It was not very busy and we sat at the bar .
I asked the bartender if this was a cubs bar and said no , i mentioned i found it odd since there was a cubs flag out front , she stated she had no idea about the flag .
She honestly had no personality , typically a bartender will try to engage the customer in a little talk , unless they are busy of course , but all she did was serve the drinks and walked to the end of bar and just stand there until someone needed something .
And as some of the other reviews have mentioned , it 's not really korean .
I had been trying to fix the pool by myself for about 10 days , with no luck .
I was really impressed that it s an older pool and he did not try to upsell me , or make it a bigger deal that it was .
I am not a big review writer , but i was impressed by the service and the honesty in fixing my pool for under $ 100 !
I ended up choosing wellish vision institute not only because of a recommendation from my optometrist , but also because everything i could find on the internet indicated that this place was the best in vegas .
Price was not a concern ; i wanted top quality .
The consultation process was great and there was no crazy sales push .
It has taken me six years to finally get lasik because i wanted to make sure that i found a surgeon that would not take any risks with my vision .
I see so many reviews on here complaining of the parking situation and it 's a shame cause tj 's is nice enough to provide free parking and for some reason many do not know even though there is a big sign as you are walking into the store stating free parking .
So i appreciate them sampling things that i would not normally pick up .
The only thing that i am not a huge fan of is the produce .
No no no no no no .
No other asian spotting in the restaurant though .
The waiter comes and gets our order and we proceed to wait half a century for our meals ... ok , you make each order as you receive it , but it should not be 40 minutes before anything comes .
We also did not get olive oil to dip it , like all the other tables did ?
Is it because we do not belong ?
The waiter was never to be seen again , not even when our waters were empty and we were dying of thirst .
No nothank you ' or ' do you want change for this '..
He finishes the transactions and rushes away with a ' have a good night ' ... does that mean i do not get change ?
I will never return to this location again .
The price is not bad in my mind we order the grill pork bahn mi sandwich , the egg rolls , and chicken pho all the time and it 's affordable .
We notified the waiter in regards to the bread and he apologized and said the head waiter whom is supposed to have fresh bread ready was 20 minutes latr that day and they just were really not ready when they opened today .
I can say i am now over outback and will stick to texas roadhouse even though they do not serve lunch during the week .
The budae stew ( army base ) was good but one of the waitresses literally harassed me for not giving a 10 % tip and was really trying to fight me ( i tipped using the exact $ option ) .
Most customers will not come again after being harassed for tips ... my friend and i are just still students ( unemployed ) and our hoodies were not exactly designer ... not sure why the waitress thought we are made of money lol
I would say give it a try for the atmosphere and drinks , not necessarily the food .
I was not offered an apology or compensated for an inferior and smaller cut of meat .
Needless to say , there are a hundred different steak restaurants in town and i will not be returning to waverly 's .
The noodles were just right ( not hard or mushy ) my husband had rare beef and tea .
No much to say about this place .
Have appointment at 7:40 am and did not see the doctor till 11 am .
Please take care of your patients , and if you are too busy do not take too much of appointments that you can not even squeeze them in .
I went to ben 's since jimmy johns had not so great reviews next door .
It was served over veggies which may be something they do in az but i had never had that before .
I probably would not order the katsu again but it 's a sushi place so i would probably order that if i ever get there again .
Throughout my massage , my therapist was very kind and made polite conversation , which i did not mind .
I thought this was really nice because i was somewhat worried she 'd keep talking , and i am not the type of person to ask someone to stop lol .
It did not involve coming to get more massages from here , and i never felt any pressure from anyone to buy a package or something .
Someone things that were working just fine all of a sudden do not when they leave .
There were not many options and not 1 dip on the menu !!
They had hh specials - $ 5 house wine ( originally $ 6 ) and moscow mules for $ 6 . our server did not come to our table for about 15 minutes .
She did not seem too interested in working .
I do not mind waiting , but they were not busy .
The drinks were good - the outdoor area is nice - not sure if i would return .
( i hope the owner is reading this because it 's in english get a translator because no one at huh ga ne speaks english !!!! )
- good food - big portions - bad service and unfriendly unless you are korean and can only speak korean as no one here speaks any english or speaks very little of it also there 's plenty of side dishes included and can be refilled the service is and always will be s*** we asked for lemons and the lady brought us a menu saying we do not sell it so we were confused after we repeated 5 times we just want lemon slices she understood ( all of the servers speak no to very very little english are they illegals or something ? ! )
Anyways we were halfway finishing our meal and one of them brings us the bill which i find really rude we did not ask for the bill !
Tonight we got our dinner to go and it was late 9:15 when we ordered so i expected them not to have prime rib , but .... they did !
" updated " ordered mac n cheese , never got it and we were never told they do not have any .
Another dickeys that i will not be going to again .
No response .
It is now the 8th of may - still no response from dickey 's .
It is conveniently located and will not burn a whole in your pocket like many of the over - pricey and inconsistent co-ops .
Take in mind this place does not take reservations so if you do not get in for dinner before 6 pm you are going to be waiting for a table .
I stole about 6 boxes .. do not tell anyone :p
Pretty happy , we were placed into a corner , where we could never get any service , because nobody saw us .
I have never ventured out to their lunch / dinner menu .
It was not good .
The pico de gallo and avocado had no flavor whatsoever .
My fries also were way too salty and did not come out with the sandwich .
Not a huge deal .
My wife 's turkey bacon was not cooked at all .
Luckily my daughter did not finish her pancakes so i did enjoy something .
You know you can judge a korean restaurant by the quality and quantity of their side dishes , and this restaurant definitely meets expectations ; not to mention , their kimchi jjigae is the best in town .
The prices are very modest , you can not go wrong here .
Being a snowbird from ak & not having any knowledge of which doctors are the best ... i made an appt w / wellish vision institute to look into my options to update my lasik . the staff is all very professional , knowledgeable , honest , accommodating & very caring .
I am sorry to say that we will not be going back anytime soon , even though the price was right .
It is 9 pm and we can not get a burger ... because they do not make them this late --- what ?
We were not sure what to expect , but we left happy !
Mike showed up promptly , on time and had the problem diagnosed in no time , and he even had the part in his tool bag .
I could not be happier .
That 's my own fault , though - you can not blame the geniuses who invented cookie butter .
I am not vegetarian or vegan or dairy / gluten - free , i just think those items are delicious .
There was no wait for the tables when we got there around 7 pm on sunday .. and with tons of empty tables .
Came here last week for a date with my wife due to gift cards we had for years lol and outback did not disappoint !
The broccoli was easy to eat and not hard / chewy like you get at other places .
I would not go as far as to say it 's the best steak place around , but it 's definitely not a bad option .
Sometimes products are not there that you had but that 's the business .
When you make a service call to your warranty company for pool repair do yourself a favor and make sure it is not aaron pools .
He was at my house for 5 minutes to tell me that the warranty company will not cover a loud pump motor which is going bad until it is completely stopped .
He also said that they will not cover a broken handle on the valves because they are turning .
I asked him if he checked with the warranty office and they said that he does not have to do it because he knows .
Never again !!!!
I am going to get my repairs done and it is certainly not going to be by aaron pools .
We ordered lanimaka mix : teri pork , char siu chicken and kal bi this place you can order fried noodles as a starch no extra charge !
As a working mother of a 1 and 2 year old , i never get pampered like this both for time and financial reasons so needless to say it was a very special treat .
I know things happen so i did not want to complain but my experience was not great and i think management should know .
I was disappointed in my experience , the fact i could not use the restroom or shower ( which had black sewage water coming out of it ) and sewage smell is not a great aroma therapy smell .
Can not wait to come back !
I ve been loving this place , however lately due to this restaurant being popular and being somewhat small restaurant , i could not dine here ( busy 6 - 8 pm ) imo this place is best to go @ yonge&finch late night tho
Do yourself a favor and just stock up on the cheap wine and pre-made frozen foods at tj 's. do not bother with the cheap tj 's beer ( like nametag ) though unless you like brown , carbonated water ... instead buy boxes and boxes of chocolate hazelnut cookies to go with the wine !
Not a huge fan of this type of food , but if that 's what you like , they do a good job .
Do not see a lot of managers ; but , that does not seem to have made a difference in a negative way .
Service is pretty much non-existant , but i do not really expect a lot of service at what amounts to a buffet , but topping up the kimchi , rice , and drinks without being asked could not hurt ...
We have tried a lot of good , authentic , flavourful korean places in north york , but this place is not one of them .
I would not hire them .
This place is always busy so make reservations if you can but this location is bigger than the others as it has 2 levels plus if you are not having the ayce , they can sit you in the adjacent restaurant they own too ( called made in china ) .
Line ups are not as long here except during the busy dining hours so do expect to wait 30 - 45 minutes to be seated during the busy periods .
That 's not very good if you are hungry and they do not have a place for you to sit and the line up is at the door and spills onto the street .
Sometimes we choose it over the ayce when we are not so hungry cos they offer a terrific combo that includes shrimp , beef , chicken and veggies in a large stone pot with an egg and veggies plus hot sauce .
You got ta cook bbq style so do not wear your good clothes but do wear clothes :) you would want to wash them too cos everything ( hair , skin , clothes ) are all destined for the wash after you eat here .
All in all , you can not really go wrong with hickory tavern - dependable food in a low key atmosphere with good beer .
Then called to let them know i do nt eat meat and not to put meat in my salad and to instead .
The lady replied , " well he looks like he did not . "
Can not even make a phone call .
I will make sure that aaron pools does not get my business if i ever make a warranty claim .
I have heard that they do not do not do repairs with brand new parts amongst other things , and when they do not call me to let me know so i can meet them makes me wonder if they are doing some shady stuff .
What a joke ! ) meat quality is horrendous at best comprised of cartilage and fat are not you lucky , paired with horrible service .
Not too many places uptown that you can order and eat with in one hour .
Not sure exactly what meats they brought .
I was excited that kauaians were finally stepping up and setting up shop in vegas , besides having lappert 's you do not really see any other kauai food representation here ( nevermind this lappert 's is not kauai technically ) .
But i am also a yelper ; love yelp ( more like really really like yelp not love haha ) , proud of everything yelp related ( more like hey look yelp when i see yelp things ) .
I really enjoyed the food here and i did not want to sound bias or anything like that so after bookmarking and visiting i kind of waited before finishing up my review and waited to see how others felt about kauai cafe .
I am sure every kauaian in vegas has already stopped by but if they have not they should .
Their food is so delicious that if i did not already live conveniently near island flavor , i 'd go here often enough to be the duke .
Fyi this is only maybe more than half of the portions , it was to - go and i do not have a larger bowl .
I liked it not blown away but it was good enough to satisfy , it was good .
There are not a lot of businesses around and there 's still a lot of developing going around the area so maybe they can have as much success as island flavor .
Do not get me wrong island flavor is # 1 by a far margin but kauai cafe , for being still new , has some solid hawaiian eats .
There are plenty of booths and regular seatings but there were not much people there when we were there .
The only knock i have on them is considering that island flavor is # 1 in my books and it 's is not that far from kauai cafe is the pricing .
It does not bother me much but it could bother others .
Will never use this company again and may re-think home warranty company american home shield .
Called 5 times to get a prescription called in , no one ever called it in ..... they have the worst customer service ive ever experienced , then " roxanne " from the answering service hung up on me ...... when i said i wanted to cancel my follow up .
No sense to go if you never got your medication to begin with .....
Not surprised , las vegas has the worst medical care in the us ....... do not get sick here .
Not surprised , las vegas has the worst medical care in the us ....... do not get sick here .
I do not know , it does not really do it for me .
I will start this off by saying i have never eaten here , only drinks a few times around 9 pm - 12 am on saturday nights .
It has a strange vibe that i do not really like , because every time i have been there late at night for drinks , they close half of the restaurant , their " dining room " down .
Maybe i am just bein weird , but it 's not really inviting to have half your place shut down , lights off , chairs on tables .
This place is not a dancing bar , it 's not a sports watching bar , it 's just got a dad - sits and drinks at the bar by himself kinda vibe .
There 's a reason why three buck chuck costs $ 3 ( and i am pissed that it 's $ 3 and not $ 2 like everywhere else in the country ) .
It 's actually not * that * bad .
Not perpendicular to ancora , they charge .
So had too try another local style 808 because really can never get enough local food in life !!
The best part is not only competitive but spread across the valley and blessed think now have few options in my area .
Never judge book from it s cover because once you get inside feeling the aloha spirit and literally family run business ( the dad / son run the kitchen ; his daughter runs the front ) .
The food since first time not sure what i wanted but ended up going for the kalua pork poor boy with portuguese bean soup for my side .
Truly not only feel the aloha spirit , just the passion they have for the food , and making it authentic local food .
There are no good sandwhich restaurants over here .
Subway is the only game in town as i am certainly not a fan of capriotti's ... ( hint : the new cadence shopping center going in where flagship smith 's is being built would be ideal !! ) .
When you first walk in , there are no signs that say if you have to wait to be seated or if it was seat yourself .
The place was not busy , so i really do not understand what took so long .
It was not bad , but it was not " to die for " either .
While the service overall was friendly , it was not always prompt .
The place looked clean overall , but i did not get a chance to visit the restrooms .
While i will not write them off , i certainly will not promote them either .
I would not bring my kids here in the evening .
Yes , for lunch in the middle of the day , but definitely not in the evening or dinner .
Yeah .... you will not catch me being a regular here .
They get really busy and they did not bother coming back to check on us and see if we want more food .
They provide good meat options but it appears that they did not bother to take time to marinate it .
They do not have a variety of kimchi and it tastes average at best .
Overall , if you like to eat a lot and do not care about taste or service , go here .
This place is not bad for a 24 hr place , certainly better than the other 24 / hr places at yonge and finch , like dingy kayagum and barely - passing - their - health - inspection pyung won house .
If you are a normal sized asian or bigger , this is not going to work well for you .
They just put two spoons on the bare table , which is not cool .
The workers are all busy even though they are definitely not understaffed .
They are very rushed and that 's not good , because one ended up dropping a whole 24 case of bottled beer , which made a huge mess and commotion .
They do not salt them , but add a little malt vinegar and a shake of salt and you will not regret it !!
Not really sure how to rate this place .
It s not my favorite bbq place as the portions are kinda small and it s just lacking a certain something that i can not quite put my finger on .
I did not know what to expect !!
Highly recommend wellish vision institute to all my friends and family oh and not to mention dr ortiz and his staff are bilingual a huge plus !
- 24 hr spot with good food ( rare ) - cheap and will definately fill you up - service is not friendly but fast .
Some of the packaged and frozen items can be hit or miss , and you probably would not want to do all your shopping at tj 's , but it 's a great alternative to your standard supermarket and has more reasonable prices than whole foods ( aka " whole paycheck " ) .
Why would i want you to come back again , when you could not fix the problem after 2 visits , which i had to wait 5 days total for ?
Plus you did not offer next day free , you said if there was a cancellation before next week , then i might could get a visit and that " i should be thanking you " for even getting that .
People do not complain about great service , but crappy service is a great motivator .
After the massage was over i was able to take my time winding down and was never rushed to pay and leave .
This time there were no temperature problems with the food ; everything was served hot .
I will never do that again .
I hate it when restaurants serve tiramisu as a cake - it s not a cake dam nit !
It s light fluffy not too sweet not too strong and just melts in your mouth .
I read through some of these reviews and came to the conclusion that some people do not understand how the rating scale works .
It did not have any flavor besides cheese , but obviously that 's what i expect mac and cheese to taste like .
This review is not on the quality of work performed by dr wellish .
Rear waiting room , it was not until 3:20 pm that we were called in to see the doctor .
Another epic scheduling fail , was arriving for a 9:10 am appointment and not being seen until 10:45 am. to me , this is really an unacceptable practice , on their part , and it is a shame because i will not recommend this physician to others , based on their poor scheduling efficiency .

Here 's one more example ... my dad 's first surgery was scheduled for 2 o'clock and he was not wheeled off until 3:40 pm. the shortest wait time we ever had was about 40 minutes .
I had procedures not covered by insurance , and they did not help at all .
They were not good at it , and had great difficulty with the process , causing more than one technician to try each time .
The process was very difficult , and the lenses never stayed in .
After many months of tedious visits , the doctors seemed to have lost interest in helping me , and did not want to even see me .
I would not recommend them .
Ok , look , it 's denny 's i just can not give a denny 's a five star review well , because it 's denny 's .
The rice cake did not come with a lot of sauce , but i did not mind because the flavors were strong , just a little on the sweet side .
It came with a lot of side dishes , but the assortment were not my favorite .
I can not understand how this place stays in business , if you want great bbq , go to rudys !!!!!!
She has worked at wellish for some time so she had a wealth of knowledge and info on everything and answered all my questions and resolved issues in very short order . nicole was so pleasant to speak to i am a little surprised she did not offer to come and pick me up and drive me to the appointment !
My eyes already feel better and i am not really sure i even need the appointment now .
If you are in need of eye care i suggest you call wellish vision institute and make sure you ask for nicole - you will not regret it .
Waited in line for over 1 hour and they do not take reservations on busy days but somehow this gentleman who is the owners son happens to bring 5 friends in and bypass a long lineup .
I am still in line waiting . !!! jan 15 8:17 pm ... poor service and no respect for loyalty of customers !!
So , getting a good view is no issue .
This time i choose an appetizer , buffalo chicken dip with tortilla chips , that was so addictive i can not wait for more .
Not really sure why they call this place the french quarter .
No real kids menu .
Reasonable prices , good service , good selection of appetizers and drinks , and a complementary bloomin ' onion which was supposed to have been a " taste . " did not eat any steak since my husband cooks the " best " at home , though he ordered a ribeye and said it was good .
Tip : to avoid the weekday lunch rush , i recommend arriving no later than 11:30 a.m. , or you will stand in line to get in .
We went there last evening the service was slow we waited over 25 minutes to get our food my burger tasted like the meat was about to spoil my ff were cold i my burger bun was burnt asked them to take my meal off our bill due to it was uneatiable the " manager said he would discount it but not take it off the bill due to the fact i had try ed to eat a few bites of the burget if this had been the first time this had happened i could understand but we took my mother there for christmas dinner and after we were seated never saw anyone again so after 45 minutes we hot up and left and it was not even busy so that says something
This little gem originally showed up on my yelp app as a " hot and new " place to try out last year ... i can not believe i have waited this long to review them .
I have tried other places and they do not compare at all .
We went here on a sunday afternoon and they were not too busy .
The food was great , maybe not the ambience of a kansas city smoke house , but good bbq none the same .
We all shared the all - you - can - eat meat portion ( i am not sure what it 's called , but it was the first thing on the menu ) .
Their service is great but the soometimes do not bring every single thing you ordered ( i think they forget ) but i never quite get upset because i think it 's understandable .
When using our warranty company , i have grown accustomed to having mediocre contractors show up ... not these guys !
I usually never leave reviews or complain .
Not to mention the mani-pedi was just not worth that money .
Not worth being a 5 - star place if the quality is not good .
Please listen to mine and other advice and do not go here for mani-pedi .
Really not worth the money .
Absolutely ridiculous when there is no work ethic .
I can not find anything to complain about except the crab ragoons were small compared to what i am use too .
Did not really want to cook dinner myself on christmas day , and most other restaurants were closed early in the afternoon ( if they even opened at all ) .
I can not count how many other breakfast joints that i have been to that can not properly toast bread ; really , it 's not that hard !
On the other hand , i am glad it 's not , otherwise i 'd be eating here all the time .
I walk in and it 's pretty empty , yay not wait .
No worries , my go - to dish always is the kalbi ribs with a side of kim chee .
The marinade was good and not too sweet .
The macaroni salad did not have too much mayo which i like .
All this food for $ 15 and i did not even finish it .
The employees are not nearly as friendly and what is up with the shrinking pumpkin bread ?
It 's become sooo tiny and my grandkids will not even eat it anymore because there are always big chunks of what i believe is unmixed flour and they think it looks gross .
First off , there are not many french options when i went which was odd ... but the monte cristo was fantastic , the service was supa slow though
Coming from a vietnamese person , this is probably the worst pho i have ever had .... the texture of the noodles were not right and the soup lacked flavor .
Not too shabby !
I woulld not consider this place as a cajun / creole place but the food that they serve is typical american - greek fare with a couple of new orleans style dishes thrown in for good measure .
Our conclusion was that it was decent food , not too expensive given the normal scottsdale prices , but it was nothing to write home about .
The meat was really tender , but did not carry a lot of flavor on its own .
The green beans were mushy and mostly flavorless ( definitely not my favorite ) .
The baked potato casserole was great , but what 's not to like about mashed potatos that taste like a loaded baked potato ?
The consistancy is pretty thin so it does not really grab the meat , but that just means adding more and you can have as much as you want .
I would go back to try a couple different meats , sides and a couple of their salads - and if you are craving bbq on a budget and do not want to make it yourself , this is good food .
Not too many customers .
Was not impressed
Mike , my apologies we all can get a little heavy handed with these posts , and not give you a fair chance to start with .
But during that time we had already made a decision about the company in our minds and it was not fair .
To be honest i do not see the hype for this place especially in an area with so much selection .
The broth tasted bland and the pork was not the easy fall - off - the - bone type you typically expect from this dish .
I think they need to do something about the outside of the restaurant , which is not too welcoming looking .
This should not be happening at all , but especially during such a busy rushed time and small space , customers do not need to see that when they are trying to eat .
Overall , i do not think i would come back here especially since there are so many other competing restaurants on the strip .
Yes the food is cheap but i would rather pay the few extra bucks to get better quality food that is not just fillers .
I explained to the home warranty company that the pump motor was not working on waterfall .
I was told that it was covered because it was part of the original pool and not an add - on .
They asked that i leave the co pay in the timer box because no one would be home at the time of service .
They said waterfalls are not covered .
Definitely not a bargain , though .
Waitress never checked on us once .
I could not have asked for a better experience for my family .
They will require you to call them very often to get any discounts renewed , and if you forget you are stuck , no going back .
I do not know if i was drunk , but some how this bowl tasted like the best thing i ever ate , and was hooked thereafter .
Then i moved back to hawaii , and sadly , hawaii does not have any franchises of this company which totally weird , because there enough japanese tourist in oahu to fill sam boyds stadium so years go by , and then i move to las vegas .
Still no yoshinoya , but a few trips to la , and i get my fix to settle my cravings for this cheap bowl of meats , rice , and vegtables that ruled of my early college years .
The chicken is not the same at all , and i liked it better when they broiled it with the skin on , and it had a crispy bite to it .
There was a nice chicken broth , buttery taste to the vegetables , and now it has no taste .
Mcd 's changed their menu , but they never screwed with the big mac ... come on yohinoya , bring back the original taste .
It 's not too late .
Since i was not hungry i opted for a strawberry milkshake !
Family owned i like i like as for the milkshake is was basic no fuss and hit the spot !
One you receive your first bill you will see that there is not one other bill that will reflect your contracted rate .
30 mins to be told that a csr can not help you .
Your will never recieve a billing statement with your contracted amount ever !!!
This review is not specific to this location but to the overall company .
When we first signed up we were told we could have the highest speed of internet available but when the technician showed up to set up our internet he let us know we would not be able to get their highest internet speed .
He then told me after me asking multiple times if he could explain why my bill had increased , that i would have to call billing who then was unable to locate my account and told me i did not actually have an account with them .
I would never recommend this company to anyone .
Century link is incompetent and does not deserve your business .
Thick - cut , fresh not frozen , potatoey insides , crisp exteriors , not overly greasy .
No one was in front of me , but i guess they were busy making call ahead orders .
2 . they are renovating the bathrooms and so they are not available for customer use .
There was no mirror , no handsoap .
No moisture to be found anywhere dry .
This place could be a real contender if it did not insist on cooking their burgers to the point where every bit of moisture has been obliterated .
I may go back and try another burger hoping for a more juicy patty , but even if that does not pan out , at least i know the fries are exceptional .
The burger with a bunch of topping was big , hot and not so juicy but hit the spot .
I love to eat , but i did not " love " eating at burger factory .
The orders can take a while and they are not bad ... but they are not worth the wait when you have as little time left as i do .
I did not realize that my friend was in icu and could not receive the flowers .
I really do not think it s going to be surpassed .. especially for the price .
And you can not ?
I came here because i saw them featured on anthony bourdain 's no reservations .
If you have not seen his episode on montreal , do yourself a favor and check it out , it 's a classic .
I never write reviews but i had to on arrowhead and share my story because no one else should ever have to go through what i went through .
I had an infection during labor so my son was in the nicu and they would not let me see my son until 7 hours after he was born .
That is not something you tell a new mother and makes me feel like you do not know what you are doing .
They did not send my placenta out for testing .
It made me wonder if he had them before but it was not noticed because there was not a nurse around to see it .
That 's not a good enough reason .
They were ill equipped and could not do anything for my son .
He was transferred so they could do an mri and other tests that he could not get done at arrowhead .
I would not recommend arrowhead to anyone .
They were so unorganized and not prepared .
They were not professional .
I will never go to arrowhead again .
Never use them .
I went around noon and it was not too busy .
I was told the first time that they had no record of my phone number .
The secons time the useless zombie told me she had no record of my name or address .
All of this was because they can not help me with a password to hook up to my new kindle .
Apparently our complaints are not getting us anywhere .
This is my go too late night mexican food place , it can not be beat .
Comedy bar is one of those places i just can not get sick of .
Seats are mehhhh , not too comfortable .
It was deep fried one not pan fried .
A regular beef bowl which is main dish here is over $ 6 , that is not cheep meal to me ..
I did have food here , glad i had the wings and a side salad ... can not really go wrong with hot wings !
Excellent in making sales but could not live up to the services !!!!
Save your hard earned money and do not get centurylink prism .
No flavor .
Will not be going back there again
We are not sure that we will be back as we were not overly enthusiastic about what we ate .
The chicken curry was pleasantly spicy ( not overwhelming ) with lovely cooked onions .
The dish was warm , however there was not a lot of meat in the bowl .
People should not downplay the importance of bathroom situation in the overall dining experience .
The business oversells tickets by a far margin , even before show starts , so even if you bought in advance , if you are not standing near entrance to show room , you might find yourself with no seat , and not even anywhere to stand as there are already a dozen or people sardined into the narrow back of the room .
At least the bar has blanche de chambly , but they should not sell more tix until the scheduled timeslot and the room settles . never again .
At least the bar has blanche de chambly , but they should not sell more tix until the scheduled timeslot and the room settles . never again .
Pros : delicious white sticky rice , juicy beef , good teriyaki wings cons : unpleasant odor in restaurant , food was dry on this visit , new walnut shrimp have mayonnaise sauce not depicted in photos i grew up going to yoshinoya in cali .
I could not have asked for a more peaceful passing for my 15 year old dog , daisey .
Once she had passed , he gently wrapped her and allowed my husband to carry her out so that they could take her away . daisey really did not like to leave the house over the last year or so .
If he 's so dehydrated why was not he given an iv ?
I have completely lost my confidence in the healthcare system after seeing three doctors and no real diagnosis .
The time came and we flew my daughter back from vermont , where she is attending college , allowing her 3 days to spend with buddy and arranged for service in our home as buddy did not like the doctor 's office .
Not only was buddy never fearful , the family was together and he even brought the other two dogs out to say good bye after buddy passed and the transition for them was never stressful . this is the finest way to say good bye we have ever experienced !
I can not say enough about this amazing service and i am grateful that they provide this service .
Chance was not a fan of going to our vets office anymore and being able to keep him calm at home meant the world to us .
Not to mention the nightmare i experienced during the initial installation .
And honestly i can not say this about other hospitals in the valley .
And i have never had a bad experience with them as of yet .
This hospital is not too bad .
I was not there for anything for myself , but i was there a lot over this last weekend and i did not get sick of it or irritated with anything .
Does not smell like a hospital . :-)
And there was plenty of room so you did not have to cram right next to someone who needs their space , or even if you need your space .
I know in banner thunderbird , i lost my cell phone signal , but not in this one ...
Hope that does not come across as shallow ... but when you have a loved one in there for a sudden appendectomy like the poor lady that was next to my loved one , you need that cell phone reception .
A few of the cna 's were great too ... charlie ( who was funny as hell ) , jaime ... and there was another who worked nights whom i do not remember her name .
A couple were weird ... some cna 's do not know their boundaries ( playfully attempting to touch the bandage where you have been stapled that same day is not a fun game ) and others just do not know how to stick a fricken needle in my partner 's arm less than 5 times .
I know they used to get a bad rep a few years ago , but that seems to have changed as we were not affected by anything negative .
The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because nothing about it made me say " wow " either .
They have all kinds of ice cream and custard , which actually looks good , but i did not try the desserts .
No flavor and dry .
I could not be happier or excited for my big day with this gorgeous bouquet .
It 's totally hyped - and not glamorous in person , but i truly enjoyed my wilensky special + swiss cheese , and a side of pickle and beef karnatzl .
Not too shabby !
From where i was sitting could not hear them call my order .
Not sure if anyone here knows or cares about customer service .
I will never use any other method again but in home euthanasia .
We have never been in this area before .
Spicy but not over whelming .
The manager there ( tall gentleman , he told me his name but i can not remember it unfortunately ) is really friendly and courteous .
I dropped off my parents here and left to look for parking around 11.10 pm sunday night and he would not let my parents order because apparently it was too close to 12 am ( closing time ) .
I asked if i could have a minute and he rolled his eyes and said " i do not have time , we are closing now " so my little brother said to him " but you close at midnight " and he said " it 's midnight now " ( it was only 11.15 pm ) .
I told him that it 's not and he just asked me to hurry up .
There was no one behind us and still had 45 minutes so i was confused but we ordered our food and sat down .
My brother and i did not want to create a scene ( and plus i was really intimidated by the server ) but we will be filing a formal complaint as my dad had a very obvious back injury and yet the server was so rude to him and to my mom .
I hope this is just an isolated incident but until the management follow up , we will not be returning .
Normally comedy food is not funny but laughable .
This is not the case here .
It 's a light lunch , no frills .
Simply order the iconic and signature wilensky special , no cheese , and cherry cola .
What you see is what you get , no more , no less .
At that price for a premium burger , you really can not go wrong .
His quality of life was not much after he we nt blind two years ago .
When those disappeared , we knew we were doing him a disservice by not helping him pass peacefully .
Me and my family visited but this is definitely not a sit in family establishment .
There were many to - go orders and sitting down was not a pleasant experience .
The utility was filled with too many fried onions and not as much beef .
Take your burger price and add 4.99 to add a combo , which throws your cost over $ 10 right away , so unless you are getting just a regular , veggie or chicken burger , it will not be under $ 10 for lunch .
Not a bad price , considering the serving size of fries you get .
There was quite a wait for my burger , at least 10 minutes , if not more .
Tons of flavor and while the serving is huge , you just can not stop eating the damned fries .
I get the price is good for the serving size , and the whole better quality beef thing , but there was not much burger between the buns once it was flattened and cooked .
Nothing about the burger stood out as incredible to me and i missed that lovely feeling of biting into a nice , thick , juicy burger ( you just will not get it here ) .
All in , not a bad burger , but nothing to write home about .
Perhaps i need to try one of the specials people keep talking about , but this place did not live up to it s high yelp reviews .
This place is a good quick stop for those days you are craving a burger , but it 's not a place i will go out of my way to get to .
I did not find anything crazy about the place .
Onto the pho itself , i 'd say the broth is clean and subtle , obviously not the best i have had but one of the better choice around chinatown .
As for the service , it 's of minimum as they just bring you food and tea and disappear , they will not try to spend any effort to be friendly or make you feel welcome .
The drinks we ordered were brutal i do not think she knew what she was doing .
10 $ for an hour of not so funny comedy .
The show we attended " cage match " was not designed well .
The comedians have a 20ishmin time frame to just improvise which sounds fun until they end up spending that time in comedy purgatory , not sure what they are doing .
I 'd never go to this bar again .
They never did .
Do not do business with them !
Great staff , did not showed any frustration on making late large order .
I can not say enough of how well she was treated .
Not only was i not informed at the time of account cancellation that i was going to be charged full price for my services as i lost my discount when i did not have the account for a full month , but am being charged two extra days at a prorated full price of services i did not use .
Not only was that not true , but i was not able to reach anyone through the phone number given to me by the store clerk that day and had to call the next morning .
Then , i was informed it takes 24 hours for it to be cancelled , having them charge me an extra day of services i was obviously not using as i had already returned my equipment .
With them not " believing " me that i tried calling the day i returned my equipment and not being able to " prove " that i did not use the service those extra days ( without my equipment and as i drove across the country , no less ) , they can not bother to credit me for those days .
I would not return to century link as a customer knowing how they value loyal customers even i had the option again .
It 's never the same .
Did not deliver what i ordered .
Will never use this company again .
Do not even mess with the half sour , because who wants a half strength picked ? lots of childhood memories come back with the special .
Really , you probably can not and be honest .
And there is probably some small part of you whispering to try and not rate it high due to some food snobbery or other issues or just being contrary .
For me , this place is something everyone should try once no matter what .
For some of you it will be 5 star and bring back childhood memories and for others you might not understand .
But why 4 stars and not 5 ?
Not like this one review is going to make or break them .
Only giving one star because i can not give less please please be aware making contracts over the phone !!!
Then i move try to cancel and now they claim i am on a year contract when i never agreed to nothing more than a month to month because i knew i would eventually move !!
I like comedy , but i am not a scene insider and i do not know anyone who works or performs at comedy bar personally .
I had not heard anything about jacksons burger and just happened to be walking past and decided to give it a try .
Not as good as a burgers priest or burgernator but a lot better than typical fast food or chain restaurants .
Not only were they great tasting and quality they hook you up with so much .
Either too little , not good quality or both but this place gets it right .
They accomodated all my requests , even though they were not the " norm " .
I visited this campus & could not have been more pleased !
I was seen right away no wait .
I hope i do not have to come back but if i am ever in need i will come back to this campus !
I was not let down .
All in all i was not disappointed , and i do not think you will be either .
Out of respect for their privacy , i will not post any details of their condition , but we were greeted promptly , immediately triaged , and placed in a room .
The food is not mind blowing , but is very tasty , in a simple , no frills sort of way .
Order a cherry soda with it - wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda , and it 's very tasty , even if you do not drink soda .
My husband and i ate here 4 days ago and i was not impressed .
Fresh cut fries and home made burger patties never lie .
I realize i will never come back here again .
Did not get it til 9:30 .
But do not ignore me .
I do not want to chase you for my medication .
Do not order a large unless you a total fat bastard .
No room for desserts , but she made them sound really yummy too .
He loved the beans , i was not a fan .
I have been to smokin ' q 's at least six times and have never been disappointed .
Tickets for shows have never been more than funeral dollars .
I want what i want and will pay for it , if you are going to tell me straight up " no " well then you lose !
You just made those tacos for nothing and can shove it i am no longer eating here nor paying you .
Jess salomon ( 4 star ) - talked about her trying to support minorities , fighting the power . anasimone george ( 1 star ) - did not find her funny , talked about her being brown , and interactions with a white boyfriend .
( but was more telling stories , then jokes / funny ) food and drinks : ( 2.5 stars ) we did not want to get any food as we wanted to eat out after , but we got a few beers .
At least use a separate area to server the waitresses , do not but in front of customers .
I 'd go again if someone requested but i would not go here .
I do not like the set - up of the showrooms here .
Do not expect anything fancy .
I saw a show here on a monday night and it was not too busy , maybe a quarter full , so i got to spread my legs .
The floor is not graded so if you get stuck behind a big person you are gon na have a bad time .
Some things i did not like included the fact that the doors to this room were glass , so if you are sitting near them or facing them , it can be tempting to look out into the lobby / bar area .
Also , the room was not sound - proofed all that well so the noise from the lobby / bar area was somewhat distracting .
I do not know how well the mainstage room is sound - proofed since i did not go there on a busy night .
The floor is not graded in the cabaret room either but that is not as much of a problem since the seating is more mixed and the sightlines are better .
There is no waiter service during the shows in either room .
In both rooms , most of the seats do not have an accompanying table so you 'd have to hold your food / drink in your hand or in your lap or put it on the seat next to you if there 's no one there .
I was not happy with this place .
Not a fancy place , but so good !
Do not go here .
I arrived at 5 pm and he was laying in his bed alone , no oxygen , no food all day ( he was not npo ) , no one checking on him , has not been seen by a physician or checked on by a nurse .
No level of concern and not responsive to phone calls and voice messages asking for help about this .
Told us to drive to an urgent care to have it removed , but did not offer to pay for that !
I can not stress enough that if you have a family member in this hospital , get them transferred elsewhere or stay in the room at all times and advocate for care for your patient / family member .
Of course , i am trying to stick to a primarily pescetarian diet these days , so i did not have their meat burgers , but i see they have lots of options and they were fairly busy at 3 pm on a saturday , so that 's a good sigh .
Their beef is all fresh , ground in house and halal . however , it s worth noting that they have funnel cake ( which i have never had before ) and a 15 oz burger .
Every time i have yoshinoya it takes me back to that time & i think of how far i have come so it 's not just about the food but it 's also about the memories .
This stuff has such a distinct taste & it has not changed in years which i love .
The veggies are a must for me because they are always perfectly cooked & i pour some soy sauce over everything & it does not get any better :) there 's one location in town which sucks & i am waiting for the day it comes to the west side :) worth driving across town for this stuff ?
Food is good but do nt use the coupon they cheat they only hive 2 dollars offf and not the 5 . upo asking they said it was the tax but when i said taz was 13 % they changed and said u can pay yhe full price .....
If the show was not free i would be giving this place one star .
Do not feel intimidated when you first walk in ... go straight to the front and ask for the wilensky special !
I had to take off one star because i am not a big fan of the cornmeal dusted bread .
Eat it on the go or if it 's not busy grab a seat !
You will not be disappointed !
There were no other customers when we got there so we were served relatively quickly .
I have not tried the other burgers so i can not comment .
No complaints .
I do not mind paying a bit more for something good so although $ 30 seemed high to me it was not that big of a deal .
Again i do not mind waiting as long as it s worth the wait in the end .
The middle of the patty was stuffed with cheese and was nice and melted as the pictures showed but did not do much to help the taste .
I guess this is a decent restaurant to try out other viet dishes besides pho , and dishes that are not broth based .
No specialty , but the overall food you get from there that are not broth based are somewhat decent compared to pho restaurants .
I can not wait to go back again and again .
The staff are no nonsense , genuine and the decor is very charming .
I know this is their classic style but i do not like it .
Come here and you will not be let down
You can not ask a question without getting a defensive response .
My questions were general , like what 's the next step ( day 2 in the hospital the er doc followed up and did not know my husband had a procedure done the night before ) , and what medication was being given ( when i questioned why , er nurse said it s what was ordered and shrugged when i said my husband would have opted out if he knew what it was for , and continued to administer ) .
I do not want to bash the hospital or staff , there are 2 sides to every story .
It was never this bad .
Not the cheapest but beautiful arrangements , reliable delivery .
Flowers lasting is a function of room temperature as much as anything , not easy here in vegas .
I am not sure where to even start .
The " burger " was quite literally a whisper of meat that was so thin and crisply fried that i could not even taste it .
It could not have been more than 2 ounces of meat .
Not good freddy !
Not too busy in the evening .
Came with the skewers were a whole bunch of fresh herbs which most restaurants do not offer .
I had never heard of it ( i am from out of town ) .
This place would be a solid 5 stars if it were not for the burgers .
From the perspective of " oh , hey , it s about a 30 minute wait for pho type foods " and the " why do not we bring out the appetizer quicklier if it takes a while to prep the main plate .
But , that 's not super important as what matters more is the food .
The only downside is that the skewers were one large honking slice of meat , and no fork was provided .
Also , no doctor came to see me , just a tech to put a fiber glass splint .
This place does not even deserves 1 star .
After a month 's battle of illness ( and many trips to the vet 's office , medications , procedures , etc. ) , we realized that there was not going to be a turnaround in jack 's health , and he had stopped eating and drinking altogether .
I did not want to put him through another trip to the vet 's office and have him be anxious / scared ( as many cats are when not in their own environment ) or in pain ( from transportation ) in his final hours .
And i could not even imagine driving home with his empty pet carrier .
My veterinarian and staff are amazing , but unfortunately they do not perform house calls , and i am very grateful to them for recommending happy endings .
For any other loving owners who , as we all do at one point , need to make that hard decision for our pets , i can not say enough good things about happy endings .
Do not let their thinness fool you , they are filling .
Matter of fact , prices are the only reason i can think of that this place did not get 5 stars from me .
I took my husband back ... he 's not a burger person , but he really liked it too .
Now i am having trouble not going there every day !
Cause then i 'd give this place 2.5 / 5 they do seem to have a good selection but honestly the burger was not terrific .
I really did not enjoy them , which was unfortunate cause i was really in the mood for fries and i ate them all anyways .
I did not eat in but noticed the layout was not great but was actually still similar to a lot of places in the area , as there 's only a limited amount of things you can do with a space that small .
I do not understand the fascination with this place .
Many lies , and if a class action suit does not surface , then there is definitely something wrong .
The sales person was very polite but a sexual predator would not disclose that they will be raping you either .
The initial paperwork given to me as this guy promised me stuff like first month being free , and quoted me prices no higher than $ 118 , an american express gift card for $ 100 and free installation . i told the guy that my commitment with dish network was no longer under contract , and i was looking for service that would not send me pixelated signals .
The initial paperwork given to me as this guy promised me stuff like first month being free , and quoted me prices no higher than $ 118 , an american express gift card for $ 100 and free installation . i told the guy that my commitment with dish network was no longer under contract , and i was looking for service that would not send me pixelated signals .
He verbally attested to me that i would be getting crispy clean service , while from my installation on march 3 and disconnect which i asked for on march 25th did not go in until march 30th , i had an instance of interrupted service at least once every time i turned on the television .
Now , after using there services for 21 days , my quoted price was not $ 118 .
The free installation is not true .
The 30 day free trial is not true .
And the quality of service is not true .
I spoke to this lady from some sort of customer service and she says that i did not qualify for free installation or free month because i did not answer some survey .
That information was not disclosed to me on my paperwork , from the installer or the guy that quoted me all that good stuff . so , a mountain of lies and piss poor communication practices which they use towards their advantage .
Their signature sandwich is great for a snack and is perfect to satisfy the hunger of those who are not well read in historical interior decorations .
Seating was limited but i got mine to go as there are plenty of outdoor seating in the neighborhood and i was here during a nice fall day and was not given any indication that the weather in montreal will not always be pleasant , so i assume that this is year round .
My only gripe is that this place was not fully embracing their historical decor and offering soda for nickel and candy for a copper ... and giving 1 cent coins in change .
*** do not use centurylink *** the customer service provided by centurylink is terrible !
Nobody puts notes in the system and they will not have a record of you calling in before .
It turn out that my service was not cancelled and i was billed for february and march because i was on auto-pay .
They told me that they had no record of my call in january , i was placed on hold several times and transferred to 4 departments .
It turns out i was still not cancelled but they were able to find a record that new service was established by someone that moved into my old address so they agreed to give me a refund for 2 months .
I will not get a refund until after may 7th 2016 !
Service as noted in other reviews is indeed curt , indifferent , and he do not really give a rats arse .
Good service and delicious cornbread are not enough to recommend the successor to fisher 's .
The menu is extensive and maybe there are items which would have been better , but half of our group vowed never to return to try them .
I do not get out much but this is the first time i have ever seen that montreal delicacy on a toronto menu .
It 's a mixed bag but always refreshing to see comedy not ready for the comedy channel .
As other stated , seating is very tight and except for a couple of tables in the back of the room there 's no place for drinks and no servers also which means you have to miss the show to go get another drink .
Never heard from them again .
There are lots of other venues for comedy in toronto so we will not be going back there and i advise you to do the same .
One size does not fit all when it comes to food , never did and never will .
In years past , it forced me over to pho hung where msg overdose sometimes made me feel very jittery ( i am not usually sensitive to msg , btw ) .
But i digress , and it shall be made clear that sizes still do not exist .
Undercooked bean sprouts are my pet peeve , but that 's never a problem at anh dao .
The food is not exceptional , but beating out the competition is all it takes when i am trapped in the vacuum of good food known as uoft st .
The woman behind the counter did not say hi or hello .
Including my elderly grandmother who has a very strict no salt diet .
I asked them to make a burger with no salt .
I said that was not required but he insisted !
Not to mention the food is good too .
Will not be going back .
Not a fancy place , but very fun and usually an eclectic crowd .
And it would be nice to have a more robust offering of beverages for those that do not drink alcohol ... only options are really soda pop and cranberry juice and if you are watching your diet , those are not great or healthy options ... maybe some tomato juice or a non-sugary option like vitamin water zero ?
It was very tiny but the way it was set up was very intimate and it felt like you were a part of something fun , not just an audience member at a show .
That part could have been better but it was not a huge problem for us .
I did not quite get the humor in the storytelling portion .
I was told that he was taken back , i could not go to him nor was i entitled to know what was going on .
Nothing fancy about this place , chairs are not even that comfortable , space is kind of cramped but i like it . excellent crowd , great staff and decent enough beer to keep you happy .
And i love ginger so when we asked for 3 containers for two bowls , i could tell the girl did not want to give us more than one each .
All flower sites online could not do it .
Do not let the reviews keep you away .
I only got to see a pa not doctor .
First thing urologist said did not they tell you your liver enzymes are 10 x what they should .
The meat is freshly ground and grilled so no precooked frozen generic patty , so plus there .
Panda express kicks this place 's bum , and i do not even really like panda .
Classic - need to get the bologna sandwich , and the soda is not bad either !
Shows are always late and the quality of comedians is not that great at all .
Last time i went to see the sunday night live show , showed up at 8:30 for a 9:00 show , they did not let us in until 9:45 .
After the hour and 15 minute wait we walked in and there were no seats available , they said they oversold by mistake and would not refund our money , they just gave me a voucher for a show in the future which i will never use .
I do not think ill be going there again .
The business is completely unorganized and not worth it .
The food here is not only insanely delicious , but you will also definitely get your bang for your buck .
I order the philly steak and fries pretty often , and most of the time i can not even get the lid closed because of how much food is in the box .
I can not recommend this place highly enough .
The problem : the bill is never ever correct .
It 's not off by a few cents but by a lot of dollars .
However , the aggravation is ridiculous and no longer acceptable .
No response .
I had never heard of the chain but decided to try it !
They did not show up .
They did not show up .
You guessed it ... they did not show up again .
Now they will not be here until tuesday .
Do not sign up with centurylink .
Like it s a small bowl of rice flipped over on the plate to make it look " good " but the problem is the rice looks nice but the whole plate of rice , meat and egg just looks weird like a face drew by a 2 year - old ( no offense )
I do not mind if it 's small as long as it tasted good .
I could not taste the meat because it was about 1 / 8 inch high , the cheese was over melted on the griddle , bacon was not crispy and the worst part of it all was the bun .
The bun was not toasted enough .
Overall , experience was not good .
If you are typically cold like myself , bring a sweater in if you do not plan on eating on the patio .
They have a limited happy hour that we did not take advantage of that time .
I did not plan on the panic when the service we had used the two times before did not respond .
He not only came to us that night , but juggled priorities , based upon alicias 's assesment of our need and arrived earlier than scheduled .
I wish that you all never ever have to meet him , but this is a fellow who is truly devoted to caring for the needs of the pets we love .
I went into the emergency room with asthma conditions , could not breathe .
They took me right back and got me into a room , i was hooked up to an o 2 stat machine for all of 30 seconds before disconnecting and they did not bother to come back in as i was coughing my lungs out .
The nurse did check in about every 20 mins which was amazing but was offered tylenol and upon discharge my mother was told i refused cough syrup , which was never offered .
Come to find out 32 hours later - getting a second opinion as i was getting worse - i indeed had an infection , not only in my sinus 's but in my lungs and coming out my eyes and still not able to breathe well .
No one seemed to care that i was even there .
Not only did they get my age wrong ( said i was an 18 year old female , which i am 31 ) they did not even review my results with me ( all they said is i was clear - which is not the case ) .
We have been there 3 x now and hae never been disappointed .
Service is excellent and you wil not be disappointed .
Food is made quick no matter how busy they are .
Did not really enjoy the burger .
I will not be going back here .
For a fast food joint , i do not really have much to complain about .
I tried the burogie burger because the of burger of the day was not my thing i also brought large fries but changed it to small size and the cashier gave me attitude because i gave her the amount for the large fries .
( no , i did not yell ) then i hear one of the cooks saying nothat 's a lot of fries ' i just wanted to leave !
Clearly , they did not respect me and think no one can change their minds at the last minute and worst part , they just put the fries in the fryer !
I am thinking maybe there 's no lock on top of the box or something so i let it go .
The cashier either did not give a damn or just being lazy !
I did not even get to the burger !
If i did not spend over $ 9 + for a burger or extremely hungry , i would have thrown it out from the first bite !
I do not know exactly why i love it so much , but i seek them out when i can find them .
We do not have them in az , so i usually go out of my way when i am out of state to find one .
Maybe it 's because i have not had rice in a couple days , but the beef bowl was on point !
That 's not even something asian !
I have not tried it yet but they do mention how amazing it is . )
I personally do not like it but i do not think there 's anything terribly wrong with it .
Do not eat here if ur hungry .
Have not seen a burger joint with such small burgers .
Do not even buther with the industrial onion rings ...
I do not care what anyone says .
4 stars .... minus 1 star because i am not an alcoholic or drug addict .
Their advertised prices are not the real prices , when you sign up online , they call you back to finish the contract , and immediately try to upsell you .
I have contacted them 3 times over the last few months telling them i never received service , and each time they immediately apologize and say they fix their system ... but the bills keep coming !
If you want a bundle , you might get lucky and not have any issues with centurylink , but i 'd highly recommend going with another provider , any other provider really .
They provide phone line internet not cable internet , so right off the bat , it s a dead tech .
All in hopes that they can rack up a bill while you think it s cancelled and they sell it to collections when you refuse to pay a bill you should have never had .
As someone who does not particularly like lunch meats , the bologna was actually pretty tasty and the swiss cheese / bread combination complemented it nicely .
The mustard , however , did not come through for whatever reason .
I do not know , but it was a bit disappointed given that mustard is one of my favorite western condiments .
For a place with so much history to it , it did not disappoint on that aspect .
All they care about is making money they do not care about their patients well - being i felt violated and used i will never go there again did not treat my injuries from me falling off my ladder also lied to you to get you to do what they want which is extremely unethical be very very careful going to this facility they are extremely conniving and i can not caution you enough they will lie to you
Having to wait for 2 burgers for 30 min after the order at 4 pm when the place is practically empty is just not good enough for what 's supposed to be essentially a fast food restaurant .
As there was no condiment station i asked for some ketchup for the onion rings and the lady behind the counter handed me the squeeze bottle of ketchup used for burger prep .
Overall , way too expensive for what you get ( you can not charge average prices for subpar fare ) , and the ambiance was cramped and unfriendly , with employees completely detached from and inattentive towards the customers .
But i would not return .
Not really anything new to add here .
I was promised $ 20 three different times and $ 35 one time for the inconvenience , and of course never saw any of it .
The show i saw was pretty packed and people were lining up 30 mins in advance , but since this was my first time here i am not sure if that 's the norm .
They had a tv ( maybe two , i do not exactly remember ) on one side with sports on .
Since we found dancing dandelion we could not be happier !
The burger factory has been here for a while now and although i had not been , i knew it was there .
I 'd probably be interested in that juicy lucy which is a minneapolis thing , basically a burger stuffed with cheese that melts inside ... yum ! although we were just there for a funnel cake i did not have to wait very long .
Do not forget to get their factory sauce on the side , it s a match made in heaven !
So last but not least , their juicy lucy on fire is foodgasmic .
Overall , it s my new favourite burger place , halal never tasted so good !
Not too salty and light on the mustard .
We received our modem but they said they had to send a tech to set it up .. ok fine no problem a week later still nothing .
The rep said we were on the list with an appointment just the tech never showed and they did not know why !
Move over fillie - b 's , i no longer have to tolerate your bland excuse of a burrito .
Do not ever eat here because they over charge for meals here and the quality is terrible .
I left for work at 5 am on friday , feb. 3 rd 2017 and noticed meadow was under the table and not eating his orijen six fish food he loved since 2006 .
When i came home he was on his therapeutic pet bed and not eaten .
He rolled off his bed at around noon saturday and did not move after that .
For the first time in his life he not only could not get up , he could not move his rear legs .
Meadow contracted sards in jan . 2012 and we nt blind in a week and was never active after that .
Meadow was no longer in pain .
Never again .
We are vacationing so we were not familiar with this hospital .
She was a little bit vacant , no indication they did not do urgent care there .
Not urgent care , $ 250 c0 - pay .
Not this one .
We did not dirty up any of their er rooms , just a triage room meeting with a desk .
Final bill was $ 830.00 from the hospital and $ 310 from a md we never did see .
Post a sign or have your front desk person wake up and tell people it 's not an urgent care .
I will not go anywhere else !
Did not disappoint !!
Greg had said they probably would not be able to deliver them since my wife works at the airport and they had hundreds of deliveries that day but they were able to walk them to her at her desk .
Only to be told that since my account was closed they could not help me and oh by the way the boxes were never sent out .
I asked for a manager and was told there was no managers .
Too bad they did not offer that to me when i canceled .
Never thought i 'd ever visit it because it is not appealing on the outside - small and overcrowded , always .
Burger factory is a small joint as mentioned above , with little seating and i can not honestly say it 's the cleanest .
I do not have anything positive to note about this place other than the juicy lucy burger .
Some places advertise cheese stuffed patties but you never really see the cheese ?!
Yes , do not forget the rules !
1 ) they do not cut the sandwich in half , 2 ) they will not add or remove any ingredient in the sandwich , except cheese .
3 ) there is no tipping ... but if you insist , the money is donated to the heart and stroke foundation .
I ordered what you should too , the wilensky special , no cheese ( it 's the right thing to do ) and house made cherry cola .
My girl was upset that i never give her flowers , ( even though when we first met , she told me she did not like flowers ) so i came here and was very impressed by their selection .
Problem 1 : the 30 day free trial was not really a 30 day free trial it was a money back guarantee which means they want me to pay for my internet and my last month of directtv and my first month of prism and then next month they will credit my bill for the overpayment .
I knew that my internet would be down for awhile while they installed the new wiring and set up the prism tv so that did not surprise me and i was able to schedule it for a day that was convenient for me ( i.e. not during work hours ) .
A week and a half later when they finally sent someone out to fix it ( on a week day during work hours and no , they would not let me schedule it like i did for the install ) i was without internet for over 3 hours .
I can not find it anywhere and they have no record of the repair guy taking it on accident .
When i canceled it they told me they would need to mail me a new modem / router to replace the prism modem / router because it would not work right once the prism service stopped .
I asked them if that meant my internet was going to go down , they said no just keep using the prism router until the other one gets there ... the next day , no internet and when i called them they said " well you need a new modem , the one you have does not work anymore " .
I asked them if they could cancel the one they were going to send me and i would just go to my local store and pick one up so i did not have to wait three days without internet for the new one to get here ... their response " we are not sending you one , the order to have one sent to you was never entered into the system " .
So i drive my happy ass down to the local store , pick up a new modem ( still no credit/ replacement/ acknowledgement of the one they stole ) which i have to lease from them for $ 6 a month and the internet still does not work so i call them again and they so ' oh yeah we need to send a technician out to switch you back to the old wiring because the new wiring does not work without prism either " ( no mention of that during the first 1 / 2 dozen conversations with them ) so i end up without internet for the entire rest of yet another work day waiting for the service guy to come out and fix my internet .
Secondly , because they also billed me in advance for the directtv service that i will not have next month despite the fact that it was canceled two weeks ago .
Oh but that 's not all !
It 's not showing up on my bill but when i called in they also informed me that they are charging me $ 300 for the prism equipment which they show as unreturned .
So they " can not " remove the prism tv charge from my bill that 's due on april 1st because it was not really a ' free trial ' it was a amoney back guarantee ' so i have to pay them for the service even though i had it for 2 weeks and for 11 of those 15 days it was frozen and did not work and then they will give me an $ 80 credit on my next bill which will print on april 9th .
I had to call directtv about their portion of the bill because centurylink said they have no control over what directtv bills me for even though i signed up for directtv through centurylink and all of the charges show up on the same bill which is sent to me by centurylink .
We can not thank happy endings enough for taking a miserable situation and making it bearable .
Everything was handled gently , sweetly and we felt like he and his assistant truly understood this was a family member , not just a dog .
I can not imagine ever doing this any other way again .
This is not a review for comedy , as i did not get to see any , but a review of food and venue .
It 's pitch black in the comedy room , so if the show has already started , stfu and stand wherever you can because finding a seat in the dark is obtrusive to the performance and the room is tighter than a ... i do not know .
I asked the bartender what time the next show started , but she did not know .
I accepted the fact that i would not be enjoying any comedy that night , and since i was famished , i ordered food - mac & cheese .
It was not good .
I must not have been the only person who thought so , because just now when i went to check the website for the exact price ( i recall it being ~ $ 9 ) , it was no longer on the menu .
I would even say it was offensively bland , but i was so hungry i plowed through exactly 1 / 3 of it - and i do not exactly scoff at anything with the words " baked " and " cheese " in the description .
You do not want to go to denny 's or waffle house , or jack - in - the - box , you want something good .
Sure , they sell bongs and beer and corner store items , but i am not about that life -- for me it 's all about the amazing food in the back .
As other reviewers have stated , there were so many employees standing around and talking that it made us uncomfortable and no one seemed to have anything to do .
The bar is not a large area so there was no avoiding their conversation .
A friend of ours ordered the brisket , and got nearly an entire piece of fat , which they replaced for him at no charge .
Even when they did not have what i was looking for they willfully pointed me in a helpful direction . customer service is top notch ... as another example , for a nominal fee they will even clean - up and prepare potted plants purchased from plant nurseries , home depot , etc .
No carbonation , no ice unless you go to the counter and ask for it .
The installer was courteous and in and out my home at a no time .
I use the services now for 4 months on my desktop , 5 laptops 5 smartphones , 2 tablets and 2 smart tv 's with no problems and only $ 33 a month .
Not only that , these guys also have a street - style mexicali take - out restaurant built - in to the store .
That shizz is bomb and it 's not expensive .
I am never disappointed when i get to eat here however ............ they are closed on wednesdays and ....... sometimes they have been randomly closed on other days too , seemingly without warning !!!!!!!
This special dish that you can not find at most vietnamese restaurants ( because it 's very time consuming to make ) consisted of rice paper ( you have to wet it in the warm water , to soften it up ) , which you use to wrap the bbq pork sausages in along with vermicelli and choice of vegetables / herbs .
Never let 's me down .
Do not let the appearances dissuade - the food is quick , cheap and tasty .
I hope to stay out of the hospital , but would not hesitate to return to arrowhead hospital .
They told us they do not install on saturdays and can not switch from other carriers on those days so we would have to take time off work during the week to re schedule .
We told them no thanks !
The burger is pretty much the same but does not have cheese in between .
I had to change delivery instructions at the last minute ( i felt bad about this but i had no choice ) .
So i rushed over to the next closest place , the dancing dandelion , and got there 5 minutes after the same closing time and the woman was just finishing up with a customer and told me not to worry about the closing time .
- patty was not salted so better to put the sauces and topping to get some taste - cheese in the middle of patty a good touch - if you are into burgers , this is a good place - a little on the expensive side @ $ 11 + per combo
I can not say enough positive things about my experience with happy endings .
I had never been here before so i was nt sure what to expect .
The place was busy , but not super packed .
I was not sure about the extra skinny shoestring fries at first , but they are really good .
This is not just another fast food place !
Get there early so you do not have to stand around while you wait .
The fries were not the greatest , they were soggy .
After looking around this is definitely not worth coming back for .
Food is not so great .
Anyway , i would highly advise others to keep an eye on your payment method at all times here because the bartenders are clearly not organized enough to do so .
It seems the international burgers are not customizable in any way - meaning no ketchup or mustard , lettuce or tomato on the mushroom and swiss .
Will not be back
I called them 3 times , and they never updated their notes or kept record of my call .
Everything each customer service rep promised was never done or followed through with this company is terrible
Will not be returning here .
It does not get any better !
I do not have high expectation on service at any asian places , so i am pretty happy with their not too pro service .
Sherry the highly regarded nurse ( by her own standard ) comes in after i had been pushing call button for 10 min , they had put me in a chair to sit up and my tubes had gotten under my foot i did not want to step on them so i was having to keep my foot elevated to do so , my foot and leg after 10 min of holding it up was very painful , i was even start to yell out of room for help , a great nurse ( russ ) there came in moved the tubes and pushed the working call light and left room took about 10 - 15 seconds , so sherry comes in and starts by " what 's your problem " , i try to tell her about call light and she blows me off saying no no the lights work , and i try to explain the button i was pushing did not work , this go 's on and on not to get too detailed she is yelling at me and now i am really upset that she is calling me a lier , sherry ends up calling in my surgeon ( calls in one of the best and in demand heart surgeons in the state ) for a broken call light .
In the end i almost moved hosp for recovery ( wish i would of ) sherry was told none of the call lights on the beds in icu worked that 's why they , installed the buttons on a cord , sherry did not even know that , i feel this icu unit , have a old single women in menopause that abuse patiences .
Do not go there .
There used to be another location but that was closed down due to i assume not enough business .
Not the best care on the inpatient side .
Do not switch to centurylink !
Do not switch to centurylink !
Not as consistent as cox but more affordable through the offer .
They could not renew my offer and on top of that charge my parents an additional $ 15 to disconnect the line .
First , they had no lunch specials , which for a student like me is gold !
Not sure why that took so long .
And it was not even that tasty -- was actually quite bland .
I took a peak through the rest of the menu and they did not offer many choices that i liked .
For instance , they had only chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice -- not beef , no bbq pork , no yung chow .
Also , the prices were not particularly cheap .
I probably would not return .
If i could put no stars that still would not do this company any justice .
I am tired of getting ripped off by cable / internet companies and i will never use this company again .
I am in touch with a high rate of new " las vegans " every year and i will make sure to tell them to never use centurylink .
I already had problems with their customer service but to have someone in the retention center yell at me because i inquired about the high fees for " termination " which is not my fault i have to terminate is unacceptable .
I have talked to has been unprofessional and they do not have to worry about my services ever again .
I just really do not like the set up of this venue at all .
It 's a very small room and not a lot of seating , with lots of the tables having bad visibility of the small stage at the front .
The show we saw was not particularly funny , but it was a special event and it was free , so i do not think it is a reflection of the regular line up at comedy bar .
I would never want my animal to go any other way and i have to thank happy endings from the bottom of my heart .
Unless , you have been in la , you do not understand .
It will not fill you up unless you have like four orders of it , but think of it as bacon .
You do not want to fill up on bacon .
I am not taking a date here .
You also do not get a lot of the beef for your money .
Seriously , it 's not a gourmet japanese restaurant .
I do like pho hung across the street -- the place with the cow - head on the logo -- but you can not get the speciality do - it - yourself rolls that you can at ahn dao .
They also have a wonderful sour soup ; not for everyone but super tasty for those who like sour soup ( me ! ) .
No apology or acknowledgement of her mistake .
I really do not understand these terrible reviews .
Billing has not been a problem for me and the internet is unbelievable !
No problems here for me at all .
Do n't walk .
Not true .
I made an appointment last saturday and waited 7 hrs for a technician to come only to find out that no technicians work on saturdays .
I was then rescheduled and given an exact appointment time only for the technician to lie and say that he came out when he did not .
I said , " what happened to not serving homes on a saturday ? " to which the rep said , " oh , he will make an exception for you . " do the math .
The technician never came .
Back to my opening statement , do not walk .
They will tell you a lie with a sweet voice then waste your time with no apology and no empathy .
There are not many places that can do just one thing , and do that thing well .
This is not a place you spend hours at .
Do not ask for your special to be cut in half , or for any special requests .
There was no wait in the er and he was seen quickly .
Note that the word quickly will not be used again in this review .
This doctor does not know what is wrong with my husband , nor does he seem to care .
There does not seem to be any communication between doctors and nurses .
The doctors - not so much .
... can not remember clearly ) were so funny and creative .
Apparently some guy behind the counter was not too happy with that .
I think the only thing on the menu i did not eat is a hot dog .
They never even let me see a doctor .
After explaining everything ( by the way , i forgot to initially mention that the pa they gave me knew nothing about my issue and spent most of my visit looking things up on her phone ; eventually she told me that everything was " normal " ... yet still gave me referrals for several specialists ) , the lady i spoke with assured me she would call me by the end of the day ( which we all know is pretty much universally translated as " you will probably never hear from us again " ) , and that was the day after i posted my review .
Still no callback .
An urgent care facility advised me to visit the er. the er would not let me see a doctor , even after the inept pa knew nothing about the male anatomy , spent the majority of my visit conferring with dr .
Another fine example of a company looking at patients as dollar signs and not providing any decent level of care .
I go for the fries because they are hot and spicy , but you have to look and make sure it s not the ones they cooked already and doubling dipping in hot oil again .
Lukewarm french fries , and again , i was not impressed with the burgers .
The people that work there are friendly enough , but i guess i am just not a fan .
The patty was not very lacking and loose .
They grill it so it s slightly crispy on the outside which is not my preference at all .
You certainly do not get a feeling of fullfillment and satasfication after the meal like you would a good burger .
No medical staff member washed or alcohol cleaned their hands upon entering my room .
No problems though with them coming into my room to collect my deductibles .
I was discharged with no follow up care information .
Always good to take a beef bowl home .... it s aways good hot or cold not to mention the best hangover cure !
I feel that a lot of the biggest detractors of this venue may not see it for what it is -- a kind of alt - comedy stomping grounds .
It is not the polished club they were expecting , but it does not want to be .
I have not tried any of the flat bread pizzas , but i overheard other frequenters raving about them .
The seating is not bad but the restaurant itself is not in the best shape .
The line up for the main stage is right beside the bar which is not ideal to say the least as everyone waiting in line to get in is in the way of everyone else coming and going at the bar .
If you did not think to ask the ticket person which stage your show is on you are left having to ask around until someone sorta knows because there 's no indication once you are inside .
If you are drinking and sitting you either have to hold your drink or put it on the floor and hope no one knocks it over because there 's no tables to put your drinks on in the main area .
Also no servers during the show so you have to get up and miss part of the act if you want another drink .
I am not sure if he was drunk or high or both but it darken the mood of the whole place and on valentines day you think he would have eased up .
His 5 + minute tirade on a girl got to be quite uncomfortable and i can not imagine being that couple on a night out on valentines .
I emailed management later to briefly state our dissatisfaction with the comedian and not asking for anything .
No comp tickets and further emails were ignored .
We really could not care less about the money or getting free tickets but if you are going to offer something follow through with it .
Will never go back again and will make sure to not recommend this place to friends .
But hey , this is a sketchy little store right next to asu so you can not expect perfection !
In all my years never had i had been told to go look for myself .
Mediocre product , and ever changing bill , random charges for no reason , having to waste and hour of my life every month or so with their terrible customer service ...
I can not wait to switch when my contract is up .
I inform them that i am not paying that and to pass me to whoever it is i have to talk to to deal with that .
The charge is still on my bill and now i am getting a $ 7 late fee each month for not paying that .
I am told the late charges will be removed and i will not get them anymore .
I keep getting them and not paying them , nor the $ 90 charge because it is in dispute and i was told not to pay it by their rep .
They did , however they sent it to my old address that i have not lived at for almost 2 years and their company installed my service at my new address .
Never on my life have i dealt with a company that made it so hard to keep their service .
I can not wait to switch .
The fries were tasty , but the burgers did not live up to the descriptions nor the photos of the options on the wall ( which showed 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 pound burgers ) .
The enormity of the gf buns was not helpful ; they dwarfed the toppings and meat .
And the concretes can not be beat by any ice cream place around .
I was not expecting that !!!
That was not the case here , true to their word burgers were fresh , juicy and tasty !
Do not do it .
I do not even have the energy to relay all the drama and problems i have had with them since switching from cox .
I kept the phone because they cut the cable phone line when they installed theirs , and i was told i could not keep my number if i we nt back .
I was gleeful calling to disconnect thinking they could never annoy me again .
I have moved a dozen times and never been charged to disconnect a home phone by any other company .
Rice was a bit dry --- not as moist as other yoshi 's .
I can not complain . showed up on a thursday at 11:30 a.m. not crowded at all .
I can not complain . showed up on a thursday at 11:30 a.m. not crowded at all .
The owner said that few people like this place , it is not making any money , so he decided to close it .
Ordered from here for the first time last night and got ta say not my favorite mexican food place personally .
Not the worst mexican food by far .
But will not be my new late night mexican food place either .
I have never had to wait that long for my food or to order and they always have all the condiments as far as the peppers , soy sauce and ginger filled .
I also love how they have the peach iced tea in their fountain and i am not much of a sweet tooth but their flan is a must ! :)
The tacos here are excellent also the chimichanga gotta have it excellent this is not a sit - down type of restaurant is the little store with the mexican food stand in the back of it
I really did not have much of a vision , so i told dan a little of what i wanted and gave him creative license .
Can not wait to go back .
Dark place with not a lot of customers and no real enthusiasm on the part of the staff to take your order .
Fries were ok , not quite a " large " size ; more like a medium .
( if i had not wanted premium , there were three other packages and all were very nicely priced . )
Also , there is no channel - change delay ( something that drove me nuts with cox if i wanted to quickly flip back and forth between two channels ) .
It 's certainly possible that some sales reps are not as honest as others , but my sales rep bobby ( 1 ) waived all the installation fees , ( 2 ) informed me that service rates were promotional for 1 year and would increase by about $ 20 / month in a year ( still cheaper than cox ) , and ( 3 ) gave me his cell number to make sure i get good customer service ( which i assume is good for him as a rep of the company ) .
( also , when i called century link to see whether i could pay for faster internet speeds and was pretty disappointed to find out that i could not because it 's not available in my area , the service rep took another $ 20 / month off my bill through the end of my contract .
I was considering selling and the guy said no problem , just move the service .
I asked what if there was not gigabit service where i moved , they said they 'd waive the etf .
They say i did not get a promise of gigabit , just " service " .
I talk the buyers of my old home to take over my account , call centurylink , they say they can not just move the service into the new buyers , they have to mail a letter .
I tell them the buyers are jumpy and might switch to cox if they can not get internet right away and i ask when the letter would be here , they say it should be there by friday ( it was tuesday ) .
I say lets go ahead and turn service back on , i do not want the buyers to back out of the deal .
Installers do not show up thursday , letter does not show up friday .
I am on hold for hours where centurylink keeps telling me they had previously turned on the service so did not need to send an installer even though i had told them multiple times that i had moved all the equipment to my new house and the fiber line was damaged so needed an installer .
Letter never comes .
I had never had a bad experience until today !
The nurse comes in did you take your iv out no i told you 20 minutes ago it came out .
They did not seem disturbed by this roman catholic coming in for some chow so it was cool .
Never thought i would see a halal burger joint but here it is .
Allah has certainly blessed my plate the day i ate here and i can not wait to come back and have more .
Now , obviously , compared to the yoshinoyas i visited in japan this is not the same thing .
So after ordering a large beef bowl , with nothing else ( no veggies , no sides , just the beef ) i closed my eyes and indulged .
A good time for $ 20 with the groupon deal , for sure , but i would not be as impressed if i had paid regular price .
No need to beat that joke to death .
Definitely worth $ 20 as an opportunity to do something different or fun with a friend or date , but i would not want to become a regular here .
I am the type that does not add hoisin sauce into my soup and yet it tasted like a whole bottle had already been poured in .
Unless you like sweet broth , i would not recommend
I can not think of a better way to spend a couple of hours on a " school night " .
I no longer live in toronto and checking out a venue like this really made me miss the great activities toronto has to offer .
Scheduled 4 setup appointments that all got rescheduled until they finally showed up on the 5th appointment just to tell us they could not hook us up because of something to do with the outside lines .
So supposedly some guys came and worked on the outside lines several days later , then after 2 more scheduled appointments that they were a no show for , ( no call , no apologies ) and after us having to call them we finally just thew in the towel and said we do not want your service .
After all was said and done .. they never even hooked up one wire in our house then had the nerve to send us a bill for our first month of service ( which i was told would be free btw ) and this was for a service that never got connected .
I have absolutely no clue how this place gets good reviews ....
I was there late at night and maybe the cook was new but i am still upset with myself for not complaining ...
I will go back but i hope other reviews are sincere and not friends of the owner .
I can not believe it .
All customers were frustrated because no one understands what we are asking for .
I will not be back to this location .
Not impressed !
So they do not make it the way most americans would like it !
Sure they have some different things one the menu here that they would never eat in japan , but the important thing is that it is just as good as the gyudon in good ole japan .
I got it delivered and when i called them to tell them i am missing items they first just said so like they did not care then they blame the new staff that they hired .
Never again will i order from here , and i will make sure to tell everyone not to order from here .
The employees were rude and i will not be back .
The burger is pretty yummy , fries not so much unless you get the tornado fries which is a better choice .
If you plan on going there make sure you take out as it is not really a dine - in place .
They lie about their deals to get you sign up and then all the sudden your 24 month deal disappears and your bill is 150 percent more than what you were quoted and when you call they say that special never existed ???!!!!
Please do not get this service !!!
And to top it off you can not cancel , they threaten an early termination fee for both prism and internet !!
I only wished they have a location on the west side of the i - 15 , so i do not have to drive 20 - 30 minutes to satisfied my gyudon fixing .
Not a fan of their chicken bowl .
Skip the combo , i do not like their veggies .
Great for unlv students , not so good for me .
No tax portion etc .
I added up the price and it did not add up .
I was very disappointed that they would charge you for the sauce and not letting me know that they are extra cost when i asked for it .
Also they did not even put that down on the bill .
No tax portion , no extra items that was also charged on the total .
I was going to give extra tips but after realizing what they did , i decided not to .
Shame on you for charging extra sauces and not notifying the customer before hand and charging them on the bill without identifying the extra charges .
Worked well together though the bacon was only crisp on edges as they cook the bacon on the burger and not added later .
It taste nasty no seasons .
Thanks but no thank you ...
Not bad but certainly not awesome either .
I am not a big fan of bologna to begin with ( not sure who is ... ) , i felt almost bad because the staff is pretty watchful , but i could not get through half of it .
Not for me .
As for the service , i feel the owner ( or just the chef ? ) are pretty chill with what they are doing , not super hospitality but it was not rude at all .
So if you are expecting super attentive service here , you will not get any of that .
But if you would prefer no one bothers you while you are eating , then yeah .. cash only , which can be a bummer sometimes ......
Paid for it all , not a huge deal , but nothing too special .
I did notice the restaurant did not have a distinct hostess seating customers .
All that somehow did not break the homemade tortillas ... magic ?!!
It weighed in at 2 lbs , but could have been heavier had i not deleted the rice .
They obviously do not care about their long time customers .
But they do not even want to install it .
I will not lie on that .
But i do not know if your staff has issues in kitchien , with each other , because they are working over time , or they are tired and it is sunday night , or they have a bad life but do not bring it to the customer .
I am paying $ 15 for a meal i expect a smile on the persons face , a thank you and not to kick me out at exactly 9:59 ( yes i looked at the clock ) that is extremely rude .
You can ask me we are closing , you can wait clearly just wait as i was done .. but no your staff kicked me out .
Not from your food but from your service .
I know for a fact i would never ever refer you to anyone not bcus your food was great but your service was so bad it pissed me off .
I do not give a shit if it s 9:59 or 9:58 if a customer is sitting there ..
Either their service is bad , food or they are high priced for no reason .
Just got my first bill after all the service fees setup fees and what not ... and guess what ... it s not $ 45 a month its 64.30 .
Not much difference .
Cheap and cheerful drinks with a good selection of top shelf vodka and bourbon , great draft selection , good snack menu made fresh w good ingredients not weird fake food or prepackaged garbage .
There is no need to go with anyone else .
No need to write anything else that has not been written already .
I could not have imagined a more respectful compassionate , beautiful transition for my cat .
There was no anxiety for her , no pain only a sweet release .
Maybe if the place was packed i would understand why it might take a while but the diner was barely at 30 % capacity so i am not sure what took so long .
( i get the patty melt which is sour dough and swiss but i switch to texas toast and provolone as swiss does not sit right with me ) other than that always nice staff and always fast service ( does slow it down when they make it wrong but it 's well worth the wait ) i would get a concrete every visit if the small was not so expensive ..
So sadly i do not get it often !
I did not think their would be anything positive to come from this situation , but i can honestly say that the positive part of it all was happy endings , from start to finish , they were incredible .
I do not think i stopped crying in the 2 days after that leading up to it .
The fact that is was done in home , not on a cold vet table , but where sadie ( and i ) felt most comfortable is so awesome .
I asked the doctor is i could play music and he of course said yes ( i wanted her to fall asleep to a nice peaceful sam smith song ) , and i was able to hold her , hug her , kiss her , right up until the end , and they did not administer the final medication until i was fully ready .
Sadie did not feel a thing and was so relaxed and comfortable , thanks to the sedative they administer before the medication that i have heard is not always given in emergency or veterinary office cases .
I had heard horror stories about people putting their dogs to sleep , and also about people not doing so and their dogs dying in pain and suffering , and i am so happy i was able to give my dog a final gift of a peaceful and painless sleep .
I really felt at peace after it was over , and i am not sure i would have felt that way had we done with another route .
If you come here for any else , you might not be impressed .
Actually , i am just gon na say it , do not come here for anything else people .
Just come here for the nam nuong and you will not be disappointed .
The cooks are super chill , do not let the fact it 's a hole in the wall fool you .
I am not a big fan of the small frys but that will not stop me from coming back to try the hot dog .
Wilensky's is everything you want in no frills dining .
Do not know why people like this place so much .
The beef was tender , and i do not mind that it was thin , but it was almost all fat .
Can not lose .
Try the canada eh. note that the fries are not gluten - free .
They also did not know the manufacturer of the gluten - free buns , nor whether the buns contained milk products .
They thought udi 's , but they did not look or taste like udi 's to me ( they were soft and delicious , nevertheless ) .
The burger was very poorly seasoned and overcooked , the bun to burger ratio was very poor ( meaning too much bun , not much burger .
The onion rings were very greasy , not a pleasant experience .
Definitely , not a repeat , even if you are in the area and craving a burger , go somewhere else !
Omg when you go hunting for that late night burrito look no further .
Do not let the convenience store front throw you off , nestled inside alongside the bottles of booze and baseball caps for sale you will find the best little burrito kitchen around campus .
Not to great .
Never go to this location .
She kicked us out & we did not even finish our food .
I repeat never go to this yoshinoya in las vegas off of maryland .
That 's not what i meant , i meant is either one more tender or flavorful because it 's about the same price .
Sauce is just drenching all over the meal ( not a good sign that they do not really marinate their meats ) .
The rice was not soft but more of an undercooked texture and taste .
I was frustrated with cox and them not honoring my old price structure when i moved .
Century link told me prices and i asked for them in writing and they would not do that , just verbal promise on the phone .
Then i call to confirm my set up and pricing the day before installation , since i got no written confirmation .
All of a sudden the internet speed was slower and the speed i agreed to was not available in my area .
She informs my she does not know why as she too can see i applied on 2-14 - 14 and that i have all the services required .
For not much more than the same price i can go across the street to east boy and get a decent chicken bowl with green beans , seaweed salad and nice rice .
Yoshinoya is the first place around unlv that i will not bother to return to .
I liked all the meats except i did not care for the sausage .
I am typing this with tears in my eyes but i could not not write something about these amazing people .
I can not imagine doing this day after day but the love dr .
I did not hesitate for a second when we realized bella 's time was no longer " quality " and she seemed to struggling through so much .
We were never disappointed with the quality of food , everything tasted really flavourful , broth is great and they are generous with the other ingredients as well such as the mint and bean sprouts .
Not only that but the waiters do not really come around that much to refill water or anything , we usually have to raise our hand to ask .
The drinks are cheap , the food seemed like a decent price , though i did not order anything so i can not speak for the quality , and i would say it was a successful night .
None of us had every been to an improv show ( only stand up comedy ) , and i did not quite know what to expect , but it was definitely an enjoyable night .
I was not in stitches the whole time , but i * was * wiping tears of laughter from my face more than once over the course of the 2 hours .
This is a classic for me i grew up in this stuff .. ok so i am thinking the bad reviews are because people do not know how to eat here so here let me help you out .. large beef bowl ( add chilli. powder , ginger , and soy sauce ) clam chowder is a must if you are really hungry get some sesame chicken wings that is all
I dk why yelp says it closed on days it 's not .
I know it happens , no biggie , but i do expect someone to offer an apology .
I do not know about anyone else out there , but after spending $ 40 on burgers and fries for 4 , i like to know that my business is appreciated .
And in this case , they did not do that .
I would not go with centurylink if they were the last telecommunications business on earth !
Prism tv was blurry , internet service was dsl ( which they never told me it would be when i signed up ) , and they had no problem with continual harassment via collection agency 's .
I will never , ever recommend centurylink to anyone ... friend , family or otherwise .
He tells us that this place has not ever changed , and i agree .
I never did .. but i saw that this one had opened up !
The chicken was a little better .. had a little more flavor but there was a lot of skin and not as much meat as i would have liked .
I prefer l&l mac salad but they are two totally different recipes so that s not fair to compare i guess .
I wo nt come back here to eat .. just not my cup o tea .
Some people are nice , but they are not allowed to help you .
Our " fast " internet does not allow for streaming half the time .
But you do not see your last bill until the middle of the next cycle .
Just do not do it !
Could not have asked for more .
The atmosphere is relaxed , the service friendly and the drinks prices on par with any other place ( nice to not get hosed at a performance venue ) we saw a friday night improv show ( $ 10 at the door - cheaper than a movie ! ) which was a ton of fun , despite the fact that i am really not a huge fan of improv .

Seating was comfortable enough and the audience section was dark , which i appreciate , since i get self conscious about not laughing enough , or laughing too much .
Never use this hospital .
I called and spoke to a very kind customer service representative , but she was unable to lower my bill because i was not a new customer .
The only thing they could offer was that she would put a note on my account that i was never informed about the fee .
Not very helpful for me .
The gravy was rather bland , and the cheese was not anything i have ever seen on a poutine ( i.e. not curds , and not grated mozzarella ) --
I am not quite sure what it was , but it did not work well on a poutine .
It is always served with mustard ; it is never cut in two .
Do not ask us why ; just understand that this is nothing new .
No tips necessary but if you do , it will be put into donation box for the heart and stroke foundation !
I am vietnamese and for years did not like vietnamese cuisine that much because i was really into italian food and also growing up eating westernized cuisine made me shy away from anything asian but this place changes anyone 's mind , it is so good , try the rolls that you wrap yourself and you will in heaven : )
Thank you so much for offering this service dr fixler , we have others in our pet family and will be seeing you again , hopefully not for quite a while !
Tried the juicy lucy with jalapeño and like it 's name says it was juicy and really tasty , but there was not a lot of heat in the burger .
Always love freddy 's food , but tonight on monday oct 1 i went through the drive through with my girlfriend and she specifically asked for no whipped cream and cherry on her concrete .
After waiting at the window for 15 mins , my girlfriend got her concrete with not only whipped cream and a cherry , but also some nice paper to choke on .
Needless to say we will not be returning workers do not care about customers at all .
Thank good ness we did not opt for the ' extra ' offered tests that were unnecessary .
Our insurance did not pay any portion of our bill as we were out of network .
Apparently " abrazo " does not lower there service fees for self pay patients and refused a pay - out even though there bill was only projected to charge at one - third of what was billed .
We did steak , but the meat was cold and not cooked fully , it was nice to add on all the fresh toppings !!!
I can not imagine euthanizing a dog any other way .
Dr. and mrs. fixler could not have been more caring , understanding and professional .
Fixler at happy endings , as there was no way that i wanted my fur baby 's last hours to be made worse by a car ride ( she hated those ) and in the vet 's office ( disliked those visits as well , like most cats ) .
My family and i knew that our lab mix could not make it to the vet & she was always so terrified going anyway even for routine appts .
Sending your pet to the rainbow bridge is never an easy decision let alone task , but dr. fixler and his team will get you through it -- one step at a time .
We let our dogs come in and sniff tiger , so they knew he was no longer part of their pack ( recommended by dr. fixler ) .
I will not be using this er or hospital in the future
This is no light lunch especially if you take down three of their special salami sandwiches .
You may need a three hour walk after leaving that block but a can not miss in montreal .
And do not forget to order one of their custom sodas , cherry coke , creme soda , etc .. to wash down your salami .
I have called them multiple times and they assure me they are issuing checks , which i never receive .
I can not wait for this contract to be up !
Do n't get you 've been warned the service is horrible ....
I have never been admitted to this hospital before .
But i do not think i will ever come back again to be admitted .
They did not have me down for any meals .
Robin sat and listened to my concerns and reassured me that this was not typical nor acceptable of the hospital .
I will not refute what others have said about the small buns .
It 's one of those setups where you pay and then do not really know where to stand .
No one knows whether you are in line or waiting for your burger .
It 's also small enough that i would not want to eat - in .
It 'd be too noisy and cramped , and i do not like the feeling of people hovering over me as i eat .
I do not know that i would ever buy their burgers at full price , but that 's what makes their varied deals so great .
The crispy deep fried latke added an amazing crunch to the burger that i did not know i wanted .
The onion rings were better , but i feel like you do not get enough .
The nutella heaven shake ( nutella , banana , frozen yogurt & coconut milk ) is great if you like nutella because i watched them scoop giant spoons of nutella out of a bucket into the blender , so do not worry ; you get plenty of nutella .
No complaints with the food , just make sure you order ahead to ensure you are not waiting 20 or more minutes for food .
The queue was unexpectedly long and there 's not much room inside when waiting .
The seats are not great for watching a show .
Me and my brother - in - law thought of the only two good things in this hospital ; the ice ( that is at the perfect level of frozen when i did not know there was such a thing ) , and the supervisor al .
We will definitely never be visiting this hospital again .
I ordered a spray for my wife on our anniversary ...... i was not sure what to expect since i did not see samples in person ; so , i just went with the recommendations and hoped for the very best .
Thank you to everybody at dancing dandelion ... you were beyond belief and i will never hesitate to use the shop again and recommend it to anybody in need of florals ..... amazing !!!
Our server did not seem to care when one of our friends told him that her noodles were too spicy .
I will not be back .
We can not say enough about the wonder service happy endings provided our family .
She layed right by the front door , her favorite spot and was no longer in pain .
Bouquet i ordered was exactly like the picture both times and prices are not to high .
It is not over powering and is not too fatty or rich .
Anytime your on spadina stop by , and do not forget they are not open wednesday 's .
We went for beerprov and bought tickets in advance ... but this does not mean a lot apparently .
The email receipt we received did not say anything about picking up tickets .
It 's not cool to oversell tickets and even less cool to not be clear of what to do when you get there .
It 's not like you can identify staff .
Lol. the space is " different " but definitely not grungy or dirty in anyway .
She could not have been nicer , patient , efficient and absolutely delightful .
Ok y'all , so i am not sure why the ratings for this place are so low .
This is certainly not 100 % equivalent to the ones in japan , but i keep myself from reviewing sushi places in sf by comparing them to ones in japan .
Side order options ( not very og ) : macaroni salad ( odd , not an option in japan ) cheesecake caramel flan chocolate cake from an excerpt from the japan times : " it was delicious , " said tadashi ishigami , 23 , one of the first to mark the return of the dish , downing a bowl at an outlet in tokyo 's yurakucho district .
" i do not care ( about the safety of the beef ) as long as i can eat it . "
But they do not , and that 's okay .
What 's not to like ?
Poor care , understaffed , if you have a senior with health issues this in not the hospital to go to .
Did not seem to think the elderly are worth the effort to save .
Nurse advised against feeding efforts and not to try save him if heart or breathing stopped .
Some staff cared some did not .
Not a hospital for the elderly if you want them to survive , imo
I hope they never raise the price or change the way they make this perfect bun !
You would never know that there is an amazing mexican restaurant inside of this store !
Apparently your credits for the packages you sign up for do not apply to your first month .
Does not quite add up .
They also serve a mean egg cream soda ( n.b. contains no actual egg or cream ) .
I would not reccomend comedy bar to anyone looking for a good night out .
Had a installing show up to install wifi service scheduled for 2 days before on saturday but they were a ( no call no show ) call after call after call to service center and we were assures us the tech would arrive at 6 pm ( wihich never happend ) then just showed up at our door .
( the orignal install was suppose to be 2 weeks prior on thurday ) once again no call no show !
Never ever again after this experience !!
Not to mention the fact that they had my valentine 's day order delivered before 9 am on valentine 's day !
I reread the description of the burgetta burger and realized that i did not even get the fried eggplant !
I would give this company an a for creativity but i will not be coming back for an undersized meal with an oversized pricetag .
I was cruising down williams field the other night and freddy 's just kinda jumped out at me - had never noticed it there before , apparently because it just recently opened .
It was not bad , but i was not terribly impressed either .
The burger patties were thin with some weird consistency that i can not even describe .
Not sure how long it sat before we got to window .
Do not bring your baby / toddler here for er care !
Besides being put in a dirty room , ( i have pictures , and baby 's mom and i both got sick 48 hours later ) the staff had no clue how to deal with a 2 year old with dd issues .
I knew she needed iv fluids , that was why we were there ; we had her to urgent care hours earlier , and we went to the er per their instructions when she would not drink , continued to vomit , and had no wet diaper in over 12 hours .
They handed me three little bottles of pedialyte , no nipple , no sippy cup .
You can not explain to a kid that they are nauseous from being dehydrated and need to drink !
The staff could not find a vein , used a portable ultrasound unit for 20 minutes .
When he did , he did not strap her arm down to a board , then complained that she kept moving !
We have had good care in the past for adults , but i will never take my granddaughter there again !
Upon completing my first trip , i could not agree more .
I washed it down with a chocolate egg cream , a true delight not nearly served enough these days .
But i surprised when i saw the bill with full amount since provider is not working with my insurance .
I used services from many different hospital across us and have never encountered such situation before .
If not they should inform the patient and share the estimate of the cost before giving service ; considering the financial burden after the treatment .
This test was not emergency case , hospital staff could have discuss the cost and avoid this situation .
I spoke with hospital customer , also sent a complaint letter but they did not bother to response from hospital .
This is one of the worst experience i had ever .... so we have decided not to take any service from the hospital henceforth also not to recommend to anyone .
If you want to order rude with a side of laziness and sarcasm , be sure to order from : vero , who does not seem to enjoy her job .
No , of course not .
In 2018 there is a huge portion of us who do not carry cash ... walk a bit to bank machine , pay 2.50 at grossmans for withdrawal .
No debit , cc in 2018 is lame .
I never liked the fluorescent veggies .
It was alright and not as good as i remembered them .
It was not good .
I would not recommend eating it the next day .
I do not think i will be craving this for a while .
I desperately needed a last minute corsage and no one could do it .
Did not enjoy it at all .
They even did not mind our other pets around to say good bye to their sister ..
Do not under any circumstance go to century link .
I have been yelled at my their customer service reps several times for questioning why my service was turned off for no reason ( i have always paid on time ) .
I do not know if it was because i was starving or because i really wanted a burger but it was definitely better than i expected from such a small space .
I love stargazers and even though the arrangement did not come with them , they added a few anyway :)
The special is an all - beef salami / bologna sandwich with light mustard served on a bun , on top of a single napkin ( no plate ) price $ 4.70 , no tipping .
The sign says light lunch and this is precisely what it is , more or less an excellent snack , and no frills .
Anytime that i am in the plateau / mile end district i stop by wilensky 's for a special and nostalgic blast from the past of a montreal i remember not so long ago .
May or may not go back ...
There was no wait time .
We can not thank them enough .
My boyfriend and i moved to to in october and one sunday night we had nothing to do and i have always wanted to go to a comedy show but never had the opportunity .
We had no idea what to expect but we decided to go for it !
If people were confused that was their fault , not the bar .
I can not say enough good things about the comedy bar !
Now i am not from socal so i might not know what 's good ( apparently if i was from there i would definitely know and be sure to let you hear about it ) but that 's not the carne asada i am used to - it 's unlike steak and it 's incredibly salty .
Still though , it was a really good burrito ( again , not from socal so take that with a grain or two ) but wonder what could have been with better carne .
This is the worst burger ever , i never had this kind of burger in my life ....
People giving good reviews they do not know what is the burger ...
Just because it 's fast food , does not mean it has to be cheap food .
Thank you jacksons for added some quality food to this city that does not break the bank .
Do not sweat the small stuff people , try to enjoy the quality that jacksons offers .
At 4 years young , this is something i thought i would not have to do for my old english sheepdog bentley .
One of their signature burger i supposed , but i do not really know what the history or description of this burger since i had to put my own toppings on it anyway .
Was it delicious , it was not heavenly but good enough for me to finish and wipe it clean .
Was it worth the wait , i do not think so .
I would suggest a harder bread that would sustain itself after the toppings are place so it does not breakdown .
Sloppy burger just does not do it do it for me , but might be really good for others .
( we did not leave a single fry survivor , we killed them all . ) and her frozen ' dirt cup ' vanilla custard with gummy worms and chunks or oreo cookie was creamy , smooth and perfect for curing post - shot frowns .
They bonded immediately , could not be separated and did everything together .
I came to find out that we were his 5th family and that his first 2 years were not happy ones .
I spoke with alicia who was not only very informative but was extremely compassionate about what to look for when it was time to call them and that they could be at my house very quickly if we needed .
Dr. fixler inserted the catheter after hank was under sedation so he would not feel a thing .
I did not have to worry about anything .
They will do things out of habit and you will see them remember that their friend is not there to do those things with them .
Be patient and do not force them into having a new friend too soon .
Went beyond my expectations and i can not wait to try the rest of the menu .
I am only giving it a 1 because you can not give a 0 on yelp .
Nasty fried bologna sandwich , flat pop , staff that watches you when you eat , basically hovering over you ..... pressure you to order more , etc ..... no thanks !
Abrazo save my life i had a life - threatening deep vein thrombosis they immediately took care me with great care outstanding experience i would absolutely recommend this hospital anybody doctors are great nurses were awesome can not say enough good things about him and i am alive today because the doctors and nurses at abrazo
Do not be mislead by the prices , the portions are large .
The bun was also good , but not spectacular , but at less than $ 6 it was a great deal .
I dumped all of the side sauce and added a little soy sauce and chili sauce which made the bun much more tasty and not as dry .
Word of caution , do not eat the fried spring rolls first !
I would not be alive today if i stayed at this miserable hospital .
I would not recommend that anyone go to abrazo , especially if it is a life or death situation .
Ahahhaha this place may be strictly a childhood memory favorite but i hope they never change & never go out of business because if i become a mom & do not wan na cook & just grab a simple meal that i know my child will eat ... this will probably be my go to over mcdonald 's or any other fast food joint .
Do not help with returns or package change , unless it is to upgrade .
Never will deal with century link again .
The burger was ok , i mean it was not that great but edible , the burger in it of itself would be a 2.5 / 5 .
However , however you do not mess with the poutine .
Fries with gravy and cheese curds , not shredded cheese .
The burger was good , i did not really care for how thin the patties were .
It was good once but i do not think i will come here again , stick with smashburger or in and out .
Not the normal fast food burger .
Mind you i would of never bought a burrito with french fries in it but i decided to go in the next night and buy one ..... i took it home .... it was huge ~!
I went back 2 more times during this week and it was just as consistant and as good as the first time .... now i will say i would never have gone in this place if not for the referral ..... it 's a small store and i did not even know they made burritos and sold hot food till i we nt in ...... this is a definite well kept hole in the wall secret .... nothing fancy ... very low key .... very casual ..... but damn good ~! and furthermore i will continue to eat my french fries in my california burrito ...... pure awesomeness ~! ;)

Phone : no issues .
It 's a little annoying that the main box does not have the time on it .
Internet : good speed for surfing , etc and have not had any disruptions yet .
That 's been a little frustrating but i do not watch things often enough where it 's really affected me yet .
I have yet to receive the bonus incentive , which is not slated to get here for a few months .
Also , the salesperson at centurylink , who was very nice , offered to credit us the amount of the installation , which i will not see until we get our first bill .
Not wanting to stress her out in her last few hours with us , i did an online search for vets who will provide in - home services and i found dr. fixler .
Andie was not stressed and the family felt comfortable at home .
I can not sing enough praises for dr. fixler and alicia .
I have never used an in - home pet euthanasia service before this .
Saying goodbye is never easy , but dr .
If i can avoid it , i will never again say goodbye to one of my pets while they are scared and stressed on a cold metal table in the vet 's office .
The services is a little indifferent but it does not detract from the food at all ( for me anyways ) .
Not much filler added - which is a bonus for me .
Not as sour .
Definitely would recommend but i mean it s not like burgers priest or holy chuck but it still holds up on its own if you are in the area .
Contemporary burgers with truffles , diamonds and pearls and all of that jazz just is not what a burger is suppose to be .
I think bold and unique flavors is not necessarily a bad thing and i would not mind spending over $ 100 on a burger * cough chokes bymark , but that type of spending should be a rarity .
This is definitely a divey type comedy bar . pros - tickets are cheap - on bloor street so easily accessible by subway - there are 2 - 4 shows everyday so no matter what time you arrive , you should be able to see a show cons : - small venue - wine seemed watered down - the seating is all just basic chairs and you have nowhere to put your drink ( i.e. no cup holders ) .
I found 4 of them funny , but the headliner did not impress me much .
Something to do if you can not find anything better .
Wait times can be a little long , even during non-rush hours , but if you are not in a rush , definitely worth the wait .
Executive summary : food 's not great , but it 's quick , it 's really , really , really cheap , and it fills you up .
No , yoshinoya is not the greatest food .
It 's not haute cuisine .
I got a mostly chocolate custard plain first and when i said sumthing she dumped some oreos on top and by the time i mixed them in there was no vanilla .
Custard was not good , tastes like soft serve .
Roomy did not receive his drink and said the hotdog was alright .
Visiting from california saw all the great reviews place did not disappoint fantastic !!!
This company could not be better to help ur animal pass .
No one wants to say goodbye to a pet but when u have to this is the way to do it
Their customer service is terrible and not helpful .
I do not know that i would go back again for a burger .
We never received the label .
I called them and they say " well you did not cancel auto pay " ... what ?
How about you do not charge me until you have investigated enough and put my account on hold , regardless of auto pay ?
Nurses will not listen to her .
You just can not make this stuff up .
We presumed we 'd go to the vet , but then i thought that the idea of driving to and from the office and having him put to sleep on a cold steel table was not what we wanted for our special friend or for us .
I can not recommend happy endings enough .
Fatty and did not have a smokey bbq flavor .
No happy hour as of now .
It was not .
I did not have a custard of my own my the wife did and it was good .
He was a very tough little dog and did not want to give in but dr .
Mac n cheese not tasty not served warm.
My wife had pulled pork not served hot very dry .
I had never had yoshinoya before but someone at work told me they were big in cali , it 's kind of like japanese home cooking .
Wow , not bad at all !
I know , for the low prices you should not expect 5 star gourmet cuisine but for what it was it was not bad at all .
This place is not the cleanest of places ( check the bathroom ) but at least the dining room is clean right before a late night food rush .
In case you did not know , yoshinoy a serves japanese food bowls , almost like ramen but instead with rice and meat .
They were completing orders quickly because it was not too hard to assemble one of their bowls or combos .
I can not stand pepsi .
No wonder the place was full of students that night .
Do not save this stuff for leftovers the next day ... it can be nasty !
It just does not taste right unless you eat it the same day you buy it .
If you are not in the in -n- out mood , give yoshinoya a shot .
Just do not blame me for a sore tummy if you eat your leftovers the next day !
It was unfortunate that everyone could not get a seat .
Everyone had paid for their ticket , so i expected us all to have seats but this was not the case .
We did not stay to drink here as the lounge area was packed but i would definitely come back to try their regular comedy shows .
They are not crazy greasy and it was juicy and everything you imagine a good burger to be .
I do not think the burgers are worth their full price because for the size ( i am strictly taking about the specialty burgers ) .
The buns , beef and bacon were not greasy and heavy at all .
The main room recently added tables to every other row , so you do not actually have to hold your drink the whole time anymore .
Being from denver it s not something we get to enjoy .
Good fast food but this location does not take coupons !
This place .. no joke has the best tacos i have had since moving to arizona !
Will never use any other florist in vegas to send gifts to my family - amazing !
The components of my hotdog were handled by three separate people all of who were not wearing any gloves .
I do not want to give anymore of a reason for these french fcks to dislike americans .
I did not want to add " bitches about how i make food " to their reasons they can be rude .
Be careful , i would not start any kind of service with them .
They do not take care of any of your issues .
I am deeply saddened by the loss of my grandpa but since the day we got there i can not help but think what could have been done differently if he we nt somewhere else .
We were told by the rn that my grandpa probably would not make it to hospice ( meaning he would not make the ride there ) so it was best for him to stay at the hospital and pass .
The doctor did not agree .
I told the doctor that the rn did not think he would make it to another facility and what his thoughts were .
The doctor replied , " no there 's a possibility he will not " ok ...... then why would we move my dying grandfather and make him suffer ?!?!?!
Our hearts are hurting enough ... all we wanted was for him to pass away in peace surrounded by his loved ones , not in a van or ambulance .
The rn apologized for that doctors unprofessional behavior and said " do not worry , your grandpa is not going anywhere " the rn said you do not worry about what he said , you guys spend the time left you have with him .
I do not understand how a human being can be so selfless and cruel .
He does not care about people .
I do not recommend coming here but if you have to i hope you do not see this dr .
I will not post his name because i do not feel that 's right .
We had a bad experience with one just one rn. my grandpa said he could not breathe and instead of listening to him she said " you know what that means ?
She did not listen and shoved large pills down his throat when she was told he could not swallow big pills .
That was the last day i saw my grandpa awake and i did not know that would be the last time we ever talked to him or saw him with his eyes opened .
He said no i do not want to be sedated , but she did it with no explanation .
Tiny burgers and staff can not seem to understand add - on toppings .
Got a regular to add this butter chicken sauce ... never got it .
It was not even busy all , too busy talking .
Not even full ... he will a&w could do better
And she loved them i could not be happier i would recommend anyone to do business with them .
I actually could not finish my food .
Nem nuong is not sweet , it tastes rubbery , reminds me of doughy fish cake / fish balls , actually it does not taste like real meat at all !!
So decided to take the whole family out for a saturday bbq lunch at some place we have not been .
My only complaints with it was it was a touch on the salty side and there was almost a half inch of cheese on top that had to be cut with a knife ( more is not always better ) it took away from the other flavors of the poutine .
The sausage was dry and was not spicy and least seasoned .
Burnt end were second least favorite very salty not much fat and they were mostly jerky from over cooking .
( again more is not better it would be perfect with a very light sprinkle for the golden crust ) anyway over all it was a good experience service was a 5 food was a 3.5 leaning towards 4 , some restraint with salt and cheese and what i had today would be 5 star bbq !!
I have been to this location multiple times and have never felt that much pain from an iv stick .
She did not want to move the station to the other side and then blamed me for my vein getting lost while she was hurting me with the needle fiddling around inside trying to find the vein .
But both nurses failed to get me the nurse call button and i was not searching around the room for it so i had to undo my own hook up to be able to get up and use the restroom .
When i went to do so and notified them , the rude nurse who did my iv pointed at the restroom door like i was stupid and did not apologize for not being there to help .
I never want to work with this nurse again as my c section is suppose to be at this hospital .
Not only have my symptoms continued after the experience .
I did not get my baby checked by ultrasound following my multiple concerns .
Just because my dilation has not changed does not mean a mothers intuition is not right .
The food was good , so was the custard but i will will probably never go back due to the price .
First time trying this place out for lunch and definitely will not be my last .
Their location looks very nostalgic , with everything looking like it has not changed since they first opened .
The food was quite declious , but not sure why it closed ?
Would not go there again if they paid me .
I do not recommend this place a ton of other places serve better quality for less if not same price ..
I was curious about the chicken but i can not ever not get the beef .
Flavorful , tender , juicy , crispy , not too salty or greasy .
The burritos and chimichangas are so massive and intense that i can not ever even eat half .
The cheetohs get soggy obviously but it 's still a delicious spicy nacho- cheesy mess ( and do not get lettuce in it either that 's weird ) .
Not great vegetarian options if you are not in the mood for fish .
Originally , he did not have an opening for 2 days , but then immediately worked us in .
Never seen anything like this before .
The seats were not unlike your typical pub seats : uncomfortable prison - sex posterior probes .
Small complaint , but hey , if you shift around long enough , people will assume you either have ' roids , or you are trying to do drugs rectally , and that 's just not cool .
For 10 bucks , you can not go wrong !
I did not sample the food that night , and points got knocked off because of a confusing layout ( i mean , come on , a sign with the word " stage " and an arrow will not kill you ) and anal penetrating chairs , but i otherwise loved the place , and i can not wait to return !
Dr. fixler could not have been more kind .
Buddy kept trying to crawl closer to him to be petted which he never does with the vet .
I do not live in the area , but ordered some flowers and balloons for my uncle who just got surgery through their online portal and everything was executed perfectly .
Promo and tax included my friend and i payed a little over $ 14 which included 2 fish burgers no drink , no fries .
Which i disagree it says stuffed with shrimp not stuffed with one / a shrimp .
I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they enjoy over paying for flavorless food .
There 's no other way to describe it .
It 's impossible to not like this place .
Extremely slow and dirty , not a good experience at all .
I can tell you hes not making much money at $ 4.99 a burger .
The guy opened the door and did not greet us .
He did not even seat us .
Just because you are a grown man does not mean you could act however you like .
I will not deny it , the pho was delicious .
I am not lying , this was so fishy that it was so difficult to eat .
My family loves fish , my dad is from the south and is a fisherman , but this fish was on another level of fishy , the type you want to spit out and barf canh chua ca bong : again , we are a fish fan , but not only that we care about the broth .
Canh chua is supposed to taste sour because of the tamarind , however we did not taste any tamarind at all stir fry chicken : the chicken was extremely dry , dry to the point where when you eat it you either drink water , or you will choke to death inside the restaurant this is the worse vietnamese restaurant experience ever .
It is truly a crime that i have never been here until now .
Adam and i take lots of late night walks and this place closes at 4 pm and is not open on sunday and it 's cash only !
A recipe for me never being able to go basically .
Our pup was such a huge part of our family , and i could not bring myself to drive him to the vet to have him cross the rainbow bridge , and return home with nothing .
The dr. and tech were so professional , and did not rush us .
I never wanted to have to search in home euthenasia , but im glad yelp steered me in the best direction yet again .
No other place could take him , called the walk - in places 3 hour waiting list .
From time he got there to back home 3 hours not bad at all !
He is fine , not appendix which we were worried about , ( kidney stone , ouch ! ) but honestly , if you have insurance coverage , do not waste your time with the walk in clinics , they would not have been able to do ct scan , or proper testing anyhow .
He is fine , not appendix which we were worried about , ( kidney stone , ouch ! ) but honestly , if you have insurance coverage , do not waste your time with the walk in clinics , they would not have been able to do ct scan , or proper testing anyhow .
I also explained to him i would be moving in 3 - 4 months to an area centurylink did not service so unless the bill would drop below $ 100 , there was no point in keeping the tv service .
No the next bill i received was $ 130 and i assumed that was the bill for the month prior so i paid it not thinking much about it .
Next bill $ 130 after spending about 3 - 4 hours on the phone with different people that " could not help me , " they finally told me i had to sign a year contract to get the discounts .
I explained to them not only did the guy not tell me this , why would i sign a year contract if i am moving in 3 months ??
They finally told me there was nothing they could do and they could not remove any charges ... so ...
Turns out they not only cancelled that too , they failed to tell me i would have to get a separate router because that router i had only worked with the tv service .
Funny thing is the guy never actually cancelled it and they billed me yet again .
Not to mention my service would occasionally go out and or mess up , and i would not be able to use the tv or internet .
Food - 4 stars service - 5 stars desserts - 4 stars if you are in the area and are looking for a quick yummy burger than go no further .
Do not go to the er here .
They released her with bp at 160 and was still unstable and her potassium levels were critically low around 2.0 and did not give her anything for the potassium .
I am not exactly sure what happened at abrazo arrowhead .
If i could give them no stars i would .
I was not sure if this was unintentional or was some sort of bonus for particularly good customers .
In any case , a bug or two in my food never bothers me .
This rating is not for the hospital itself , but , for it s billing department which is in another state !
However , one of my payments was never posted to my account and is not reflected in the hospital billing statement .
They will not call you to confirm receipt of documents .
I have never heard of a billing system that can not confirm receipt of faxed documents !
Do not bother .
When you buy a voucher for this place they will not tell you anywhere that they have a cap on how many people they will allow in on a voucher .
Been there more than a few times , but never ordered food ..... until now .
I saw no other customers , so i was not sure if they were still serving food , but one of the guys there said he will be right with me .
Service : the cook , cashier and a random worker were all friendly and did not get creepy vibe at all ..
This place is good any time of day and not just for those late night after partying food cravings ... well maybe that too :)
They kept him over night and would not allow him to eat .
That next morning they would not release him until surgeon saw him again .
He called me and said he is very hungry , they would not provide food , and the doctor was not available to see him .
I do not know how or why they are so good ... i have tried to make them , and it is just missing that certain jenesequa .
Had to order there custard for dessert and i was not disappointed there either !
I actually do not mind the wonder bread bun .
If you can not finish both , go find a friend .
Right next to the door to the bar area and holy mackerel you can not hear a thing other than the bar .
One of the comedians that watched a portion of the show from the back turned up the mic when he went up to perform but to be honest that was not any better .
It is not worth visiting there if you are sitting in the last 3 rows .
There are a nice variety of entrees to choose from - some have spicy heat - some do not .
I do not drink beer , but noticed the nice variety of offerings .
I have used dancing dandelion many times and they always do a great job , but this time they even exceeded their previously stellar deliveries and execution i ordered flowers for my daughter 's birthday , to be delivered to her work , but i what i did not know is that she was not working that day .
The delivery person attempted delivery , found she was not at work , called her , found that she was at unlv ( she 's a student there ) , tracked her down on campus and hand delivered them to her .
The staff has an " i do not really care kind of attitude " ..
No apologies given when order was messed up .
Good pho , but the vietnamese crepe pancakes did not wow me ; as they were quite flavorless without added hoisin sauce or fish sauce .
Really crispy , but just did not taste like much !
We were there on a friday night and we did not even have to wait for a table .
This was never something i wanted to write a review about , but d. fixler and his wife were so incredible that i wanted to not only thank them , but also make sure others knew that they could be comfortable with them when the time comes to make the gut - wrenching decision to put your pet to sleep .
He was sympathetic , kind , and compassionate with not only my husband and i but moose and our other dog , dolce , as well .
He did not do anything without telling us first .
Please note that i later tried it pre-made and it was not nearly as good .
This rating is only for the custard and not the food .
I get forced into signing up for century link because it bundles with directv , not only did i hear bad things but i decided i would give it a try for myself .
They sent out many technicians within two days then to tell me that my area does not support very good internet .
So within about less than a week i canceled my service after they told me it was not supported in my area and now they are trying to get me with a $ 245 cancellation fee .
It was extremely crowded and our show was supposed to start at 10 but did not start until 11 .
My fiancé was not as impressed , only because he was more looking for stand - up vs. improv.
Her quality of life had gone downhill ... she was vomiting a lot , and could not drink enough water .
She also hid under my bed frequently , which was not her style .
She was on two medications daily , and i could not continue to do this to her , and the various vet visits for the follow - ups/check-ups ... it did not seem fair to her .
Dr. fixler , and eric were so caring , and gentle with her ... i could not have asked for more .
It would stick to their beef bowl as their chicken was not spectacular .
I have had prism for 2 months and could not be happier .
Also , the wireless router has worked perfectly for 2 months with no resets .
Although jacksons burgers ' themed burgers are delicious and original , they are daily specials are now only available during a short window of time so we have stopped going there to eat as it s not convenient and paying full price is not worth it when there is so many other affordable options for burgers downtown .
Would not be canadian without friendly staff and great service !
Not to mention the close to 10 % taxes they did not mention when signing up .
When i asked why not they said that they area a national company and they do not know taxes in every state .
At one point the nurse practitioner yelled at me because i was crying and she could not understand me .
Just do not go alone , it 's kind of scary .
Seems like they are doing pretty well for themselves for being located by asu & in a not so pretty area .
You may ask to have it with kraft singles cheese or swiss . ( you can not ask to have it cut in half , or without mustard ) .
But do not worry , you can take it to go .
Tip : order each sandwich as you go , no need to order all 2 or 3 for yourself at once !
None the less i will not go here as often as i would like because of the high prices .
I like yoshinoya because it has atypical fast food ( i.e. , not the standard burgers or tacos ) .
Could not eat meat for religious purposes the day i went , only one seafood option .
When my boyfriend went to ask if he could order one with " no spicy " the register woman told him it was not spicy , and it we nt back and forth with her ( " spicy , no spicy " ) for a while until he said , " do you want to taste it !?
All i want to do is buy another filet with no spicy " and she said that they had no filets that were not marinated .
Wow . how have i not gone to this place sooner ?!?!
I do not know how the managers go about their hiring process , but they are doing a great job .
You will not regret it :)
I was billed two bills from the centurylink company in which i do not have service with .
Companies that mostly use this technology avoid interactions of customer service complaints and they do not want to solve complaints that pertain to financial matters .
This company has leadership and managerial problems in which is demonstrated through the action of their employees . i recommend that centurylinks senior representatives and stakeholders sit down at the table and start with a new management risk plan , because the actions that are displayed are a risk to the customers of taking a chance of putting their finances and trust in a company that does not deliver on their products and services and make grave mistakes .
The food was good and pretty good value and i manage to stuff myself for under $ 20 which was not the best idea as i missed out on the food at the following event .
It is not a flash place but then again not many of the good joints on spadina are .
The lady working who may be the owner was overly rude and did not have any people skills .
She told me out loud " we do not have cups ! "
This is the first time i have ever experienced a restaurant tell me they do not have a cup .
Never again would i come back and would not recommmend this place .
I have not tried anything else on the menu but jucy lucy ( stuffed meat patty with cheese ) is delicious !!!!
Fries - not so great customer service - needs improvement
The dr looked at my throat and told me that it was not that bad and to follow up with my pcp .
I went to the er and after feeling my ankle and taking an xray the dr gave me a boot and told me that my tendon was just strained and i did not have any broken bones .
He then said that if it was not better in a week i should follow up with an orthopedic surgeon .
I will never go to arrowhead hospital again .
We waited for 35 mins before we got our order ... the burger was good but not that great .
It was not as juicy i thought it would be .
Not a place i will take my kids ... maybe with friends who are burger lovers and wants to try different flavour burger .
You have lost your hair , your belly is protruding , you do not remember the last time you actually said : " wow , this is delicious ! " , your children have all grown up and moved far away from you ... well , then , this is the best place for you !
Crudy old resto , that has not changed in the last 40 years ( probably ever ! ) , their food is what a 2 year old would love to get their hands on .
Comfort food for people that have not developed any sophistication or taste ... old waitress throws the food on your place at the counter , and rolls her eyes if you do not drink a cola and want water or do not finish their disgustingly tasteless cheap " food " .
Lived 2 streets away from this place and went there cause a friend dragged me there saying her father used to love it there as a kid , well he 's dead now , do not know if it 's related to his terrible eating habits , but it definitely did not help .
There was a line going out the door , in a place you would never even check twice .
Not only is the burrito a humongous in size , but it has a warm comfort to the touch .
The food is not scolding hot , but at the perfect temperature where the ingredients cool it off for a nice refreshing bite that keeps you chowing down and asking for more .
Here they do not charge for the guacamole , it is actually included in the california burrito . the place does not look like it would be serving this high quality and tasting food from the street view .

The place does not have any sitting area within the convenient store , but outside there is an area where one can sit and eat , but the food is so good that i usually walk and eat it .
The chefs definitely looked not only like they enjoyed their job , but the hustle life style that the shop provided them .
Organic is like ..$ 6 , if the bar is not busy i will happily get a cocktail [ pretty much whatever the bartender wants to try , why not eh ? ] and i have never had bad food .

On mother 's day at noon is not the time to shop for flowers .
Now if wife never sees this review i am home free .
Drop by when you are in the neighbourhood , find a seat at the bar ( if there 's none free , it will not take long for one to free - up ) , and order a " special with cheese " and some pickles .
There are not big - hey , the place is called " light lunch " - but after two i am usually good .
We decided not to eat here ( kind of regretting that now after seeing the food ) .
That being said , when we left our show and the people for the next show were coming in , i could see why they would not want much seating because se the place was packed .
And like i mentioned , not many seats if you had food that would be hard to eat on your lap .
I can not figure out which i like best .
The prices are not amazing - their fried rice / noodle dishes are downright expensive at around $ 12 , and their condensed milk coffee - always a favourite - is an unjustifiable $ 4 . the main dishes themselves are more reasonable at around $ 7-8 .
Only issue is with the female order taker / cashier - i am not being racist as i am a different shade of brown but seems like if you are not her shade of brown the courtesy and manners are out the door .
The menu was small and i did not really read over what they had .
The quesadilla was very good but i am used to chunks of carne , not shredded carne .
Did not try the fries but the boy devoured them .
I am sure but it is not something i was crave .
It was not packed , but the performances were fun to watch nonetheless .
They served more than a token salad or veg soup ... given that their menu is not as expansive as some non-fast food joints , pretty impressive that close to half of the items were vegetarian ) .
Will not take long at all to get the bartender 's attention then . * note , the kitchen closes 15 minutes after the start of the last show .
The onion rings were not crispy either .
Will not be going back any time soon .
4 stars vs. 5 because the i am never a fan of how jam packed it gets when crowds collide in the bar area between shows as the train of post show people come out and the " line " to get in can not get in either .
It 's especially frustrating when you have a 10:30 pm show that is yet to start letting people in around 20 or 30 mins prior to showtime ( does not always happen , but yeah i have had a few late starts that have been frustratingly slow to get going once you have been standing up smooshed up against strangers .
I think any comedy fan should not give comedy bar multiple visits , shows are also super affordable and makes for a great night out !
Ps - do not rely on them to provide a good dinner , while they do have a food menu , it 's pretty lacking .
I am not going to hold that against them too much since that 's now why people should be coming here for .
When i got up to find out what was taking so long , the worker said they did not have my order receipt .
Horrible first visit , never got an apology or anything , will never go back .
Can not wait to try the new menu - those perogies last menu were fab .
I had an idea of what i wanted , but could not exactly put it into words .
He actually steered me into my inevitable direction and created a bouquet that even my crazy imagination could not brew up .
Everything went very smoothly ( and i have to say i was very nervous and apprehensive having never been in a hospital for anything at 75 years old ! ) .
I simply could not have had a more incredible experience .
Timing is everything ... but when the restaurant is empty and passed the prime lunch and dinner hours .. my showing up was not the most exciting thing that can happen to the staffs ... when all they want is having their afternoon nap ... zzzzzzzz spring roll and bbq beef bun ( $ 5.95 ) - i heard a lot of microwave beeping in the kitchen when my food was being prepared ...
Not really a good sign , so now my food is being heated up instead of cooking ??
- spring roll was freshly deep fried .. since it can not be that crispy if it was just heat up in the microwave - i do love the mix of lettuce , basil and coriander in the noodle , giving it a more complex flavour i did not find anh dao restaurant really amazing but is a-ok for the price .
All the acts were pretty good and the venue not bad at all .
Overall not a bad night , i can not be too hard on any of the performers as they have a tough job trying to make us laugh and overall they were good !
I 'd been using dancing dandelion for roughly a year or so for my every occasional needs , as well as the bi-monthly single lily , so it was a no brainer to use their services when the time came to wed my lovely fiancé .
I was not sure what to expect , but i loved the intimate lay - out and feel of the cabernet room where i show took place .
I pay for 4 mps , i am lucky most of the time to get around . 43 mps , that is not a typo .
No one likes when the decision to let a pet go is placed at their feet .
We saw no reason for her to climb this hill any longer .
It will never be pleasant but the comfort and care in this situation can not be expressed in words .
I am not really a big french - fry person , but the shoestring fries here are too good to resist !
My kids got the t-shirts and get free frozen custard every visit now .. kat , who 's the manager there , is kind enough to remember us and told us we did not need to drag the shirts in each time .
You can not go wrong here .
The food was not too bad .
I do not understand how they are able to be in business .
First of all , do not believe the sales person .
So please people do not be fooled !
Then i realize i am not the only one upset .
I am like do not you have a work order ????
He said i am able to cancel if i am unsatisfied with the service with no charge .
I feel that they are unethical and i would not want any of my friends to endure the crap i went through with century link .
This place was good but i would not categorize it as amazing with the best burger i have ever had for that you have to go to downtown and either get food from burgenator or ozzie 's .
The food was good did you see lucy was delicious but there was not too much cheese on the inside of the burger .
It was not too busy looking .
Words can not express how happy we were .
Her cervical checks left me screaming and begging her to stop - and she never stopped .
It was so horrible my husband and mother were hysterically crying not knowing what to do or how to help !!
And this was for a normal , low risk , healthy pregnancy and delivery with no complications !!
After baby was born , they placed us in our room and never came back for 6 hours !!!
We had no diapers for baby , no personal items for myself .
Their c section rate is so high , their nurses are miserable and they are not accommodating at all during one of the most important and vulnerable times of your life !
I can not say enough about these wonderful people !
Five stars is not enough .
But , some things will not happen , at any price .
Any tipping goes straight into a donation jar for charity , not to the house .
Ordered a hot cheetos steak burrito from here on 6/13/18 and it was not great .
The only extras i asked for were sour cream , cheese , pico , and rice but it seems like they put everything on it and the meat was minimal and not very meat like , it tasted how wet cat food smells .
I have never eaten there but all of the alcohol poisoned frat guys i have partied with enjoy the food
No bark or burnt ends .
They have 3 sauces you can add , all were ok , not great , but you should not have to .
It was not unpleasant but odd and with a very grainy not meaty texture .
When i rolled up to this freddy 's the parking lot was empty and i could not see anyone inside .
I figured - location , location , location and this poor little buddy went down because it did not have a good location or something .
These may have not been made out of raw meat , but they seemed like it .
I had never had custard before ( gasp from the gallery , i know ) so i wanted to try that before i left .
I already love ice - cream , gelato , fro - yo , and shaved ice so how could i not like frozen custard ?
I really tried to fix things with their tech support ( or shall we say no tech support ) .
I filed complaints and never was any follow up contact made .
And if you do not need wifi then this is definately the company for you .
The special does not seem all that special -- what , surprise luncheon meat grilled with some mustard and maybe cheese ?
It 's small and not very filling , though , true to the name of the restaurant .
Mustard - haters , do not worry about the strict requirement that the mustard goes in your sandwich .
They do not put in enough to clear the sinuses of a baby hamster .
Their website is not the best and the options they had on display were pretty limited and pink due to valentine 's being next week but i called them and was able to figure something out that was more appropriate .
I was very very impressed with them for calling me and sending me a picture prior to delivering them so i could tell them to change it or whatever but i ended up loving them and did not change a thing .
Do not do it !!!!
This time i had internet , unfortunately it did not work properly and after two week i called and canceled within their 30 day money back guaranteed .
Many other better option around this is not for the store !
I am not a huge meat eater but was pleasantly surprised which the bbq on my first visit .
Also , it does not appear to be the cleanest of establishments .
And do not forget to order a fountain drink . an institution ( sometimes in more than one sense ) , and not just because of the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz .

Luckily , i am not however it was extremely irritating to get excited thinking i got a chunk of oreo only to find out it was a pecan !
Not cool bro !
It 's never a good thing to have to put a beloved pet to sleep , but dr.
Really , i can not say enough good things about this practice .
Everytime i go there , no one is giving us menus and ( most ) tables are not cleaned .
I am always left sitting there with no menus etc etc .
I am so tired of this - not going back anymore !
I give this hospital no stars .
When it 's 11 pm in mississauga on a sunday night i usually get stuck stopping at either pizza nova or pizza pizza , which is not a terrible thing , but sometimes it 's just not what i want .
When i came in the place had a group of people and it took the employee a few minutes to acknowledge me , but hey , she was alone and she had burgers to make so i ai not mad .
I expected a pretty basic bland burger but what i got was an absolutely delicious , scrumptious , and juicy piece of meat between 2 patties that left me kind of sad i did not get a second for the next day !
This place definitely far exceeded my expectations and i can not wait to come back again to try a different style of burger !
It is a melt , goody , delicious burger that you will definitely not forget !
If i say that they are made with baloney and mustard , you may not be impressed .
Somehow , i think the fact the place has not changed in close to a century makes it very warm and homey .
I am not a soup connoisseur so i will leave it at that .
It was $ 38 for the two of us , which i do not imagine is normal .
I did not feel like sitting in an upright chair .
Again , we did not pay , so i was fine with it .
Been at unlv four years and now i know why no one ever mentioned this place .
I can not say enough about abrazo .
I can not remember atm .
Also i rank this a bit lower cause of the portion size , as well i do not like the advertisement of " two minute walk from y&d square " yeah maybe at midnight , if your doing a fast walk .
The food was just so - so , it was not really cheap either and the service was very , very bad .
Definitely not going back .
Service was just okay , really not worth it .
We take solace in knowing that luxor did not suffer , even a bit , and was spared having to be transported to the veterinarian 's office .
I ordered a curry beef satay vermicelli - ok and imperial rolls - not even close to my top 5 viet spring rolls .
Not a memorable pho .
I do not know what they put in which sauce , but i did not pay for this type of high .
Needless to say , i would not go back .
Not much filler added - which is a bonus for me .
Not as sour .
Definitely would recommend but i mean it s not like burgers priest or holy chuck but it still holds up on its own if you are in the area .
Contemporary burgers with truffles and diamond and pearls and all of that jazz just is not what a burger is suppose to be .
I think good and unique flavors are always good and i would not mind spending over $ 100 on a burger * cough chokes bymark but this place is reasonable for day to day beef cravings .
That was beyond disrespectful , and she would not get admitted until she walked to get dilated .
She was taken to the maternity unit around 3 am and it was not until 8 am that she was offered an epidural , this is the first baby in the family so we had no clue what to do , nothing was ever explained .
The nurse was awesome but the hospital sucks , very old furniture , the doctor on call never showed up .
No wheelchair l ?
No instructions , nothing !
If you are having a baby , i strongly suggest that you do not go there !
If you have to pay more money , do it .... the lack of compassion is not worth it .
We will never forget you !
Waited half an hour for a burger and the taste was only decent that the wait was not worth it .
Not recommending this place simply because the wait time was too long .
The layout of the building is not entirely clear once i walked in , but wandering about and observing the crowd can give you an indicator of where to go .
The price of drinks is average ( not cheap , but not insane ) , and for a large iced tea i am happy to pay for it .
I did not know what to expect , but i do enjoy sketch comedy , and that 's what was playing that night .
( of course , i would not drive down to the city for the express purpose of visiting the comedy bar .
It s not the purple i had in mind but it worked out in the end .
They helped suggest what would look best ( especially since i asked for purple roses ) and what not ( hey i have nt bought anyone nice flowers in ages !
I did not want to be that guy who holds up the entire store from getting off work so i picked up the flowers at 3:30 .
I do not get it , mang .
I was taking some programming courses at lv ... and i swear , it was so surreal .... " i could have sworn this thing was not here this morning when i went parked .
I do not think i 'd come back again .
Quality : 7/10 . service : 8/10 . value : 5/10 . overall : 6.5/10 ( not an average )
First off , bonus points for having what looks like a milkshake ( did not try it ) ( only one option tho ... but it 's nutella ! ) , and awesome fries .
Now the burger , the meat is nicely browned , lots of toppings , and the bread is soft but not so thin it will get easily soggy .
Just the right amount of choices that make constructing a burger fun , and not overwhelming .
Never tried any of the " grilled cheese " bread options that some places have , usually because it looks too crazy , and it really takes it beyond a burger and into frankensandwich territory .
Tasted like a frozen veggie mix and boiled beef with no flavor .
Will never go to again
But this one just was not that good , i ordered the rice bowl and it tasted pretty plain .
I do not know if it 's just me or the restauranr but i overall did not enjoy this yoshinoya that much compared to the other yoshinoyas i have eaten in .
Not to say that it 's romantic or anything like that .
With that many comics though , not everyone is going to be funny , and one or two of them fell short fairly often .
Neither was bad , but they have no right bragging about them .
Loss of star because i am not a fan of their regular food , always just come for dessert .
My friend had just given birth to a baby girl and i wanted to send over flowers as i was not able to visit her that day .
Sometimes you can not always believe the hype until you experience it for yourself ... this was legit one of the best experiences ever !
I did not know they had funnel cakes until my recent visit .
Ok i know it s not really mexican food but it 's still good .
I am not standing there for 10 mins trying to pick what to eat .
I we nt today around 5 pm and the freddy 's original tasted good but was not very hot .
I could not eat the fries , they went in the garbage .
My dad passed away , and they would not let me disconnect his phone .
They gave me such a problem and kept giving me such a problem saying i was not authorized to call about his bill even though he passed away , and kept charging his account .
The beef is never too stringy , and whether you ask for mild or spicy , they will make it to your liking .
If i ever ask to adjust a menu item ( by substituting something , removing something , or adding something ) they never hesitate and fulfill my requests with a smile .
The decor / overall aesthetic may not be anything fancy , but the prices are perfectly reasonable and the overall experience - from food to customer service - is always wonderful .
This is no yuk yuks .
No second city either .
Not all that funny , and kind of grungy for my taste .
Not worth it .
Not even worth $ 10 .
I would not be a second timer .
The chairs were not comfortable either .
Never coming back .
It certainly is not a classy place .
It is not gourmet at all .
And it s name does not suit the place at all : it is not a light lunch .
And you have to remember the rules : " when ordering a special you should know a thing or two they are always served with mustard they are never cut in two do not ask us why , just understand that this is nothing new this is the way that it 's been done since 1932 . " oh , and do not dare you give them some tip .

No followup care instructions given .
Not even the phrase : " follow up with my pcp " .
I am a insured paying customer who does not abuse the er , and will not return to this er.
I am generally not a fan of thin burgers , but i do love these .
I have lived in new york quite a long time and could not find any good vietnamese place .
Their steak burgers never ever disappoint !
I do not always like shoestring fries but theirs are crispy and very flavorful .
I do not know her name but she has an accent and deserves accolades .
Chairs are not too great , but serve their purpose .
You would think a hospital would have policies in place that would prevent the bathrooms from not having working soap dispensers ! disgusting !
Thank you greg for keeping your promise not only on delivery , but for the absolutley amazing arrangement our friend received !
You can not .
I have seen groups that formed during and after impatient theatre imploded and i am never disappointed .
Bf had appendicitis and was transferred by ambulance from emergency room of heart hospital to arrowhead for surgery - we were in a room for two hours before he saw doctor which means he had no pain mess and a raging fever .
In waiting room now and patient progress tracker not working .
Thankfully this is not a life or death situation - but i am not a fan of this place .
Once you have been to scottsdale healthcare you will not want to go anywhere else .
For those who have young children , they do not have high chairs however they do have booster seats for those with toddlers .
Due to the fact i am not a native torontonian , i can not compare others to this vietnamese restaurant .
I almost was not going to eat here cause i * just * had a bagel from fairmount next door but vacationing is not awesome until you have stuffed yourself to exploding capacity .
I did not expect much but i took one bite and holy moly is baloney or whatever is in that sandwich really that good ?
I really have no idea what i ate , but it was freakin awesome .
I did not really notice too much about the place other than the cup of dried sausage they had next to the register for 50 cents .
The act itself was hit -n-miss but imo definitely not worth the full price they were charging .
But it was not all that bad - what was killing the act is the most annoying yammering of the hosts .
You 'd think that if they managed to stay in business for 80 + years , they would have made enough money to refurbish the joint ( note : i did not say remodel ) .
And the short - order cook scratching his head right before he goes to town on a sandwich , let 's you know for sure this place is not a kosher - style deli .
We never felt rushed during the process at all .
It was not easy !
I am lucky that my buddy told me about it , as i usually never would eat at a hole in the wall place ( health concerns ) .
It was a blessing to be able to have this done in our home where my kitty felt safe and not a horrible ride in a carrier to a place she did not like anyway .
I have never been in the cabaret space , but the main space is incredibly intimate with capacity for about 100 people .
No frills , none needed !
I would like to add , however , that if you are considering in - home pet euthanasia vs. your vet 's office - 1 ) your pet will obviously be more comfortable at home , surrounded by family and other pets 2 ) you will be more comfortable at home where you can hold your animal on the floor , in your favorite chair , on the bed , wherever you are the most comfortable , and which place means the most to you and 3 ) if you are going to cry ( of course you will ) , you will not have to drive home from the vet 's office sobbing and bawling .
I will never go the vet 's office again for euthanasia .
The only differences from the past would be the fact that the chicken piece is no longer sliced in long strips .
No issues there at all .
Today 's experience had to do with the fact that the cash register did not want to work .
$ 5.69 large bowl + $ 1.80 for a large drink , when the special did not say what size fountain drink you had to purchase .
This yoshinoy a also does not seem to follow any standard rules .
Sometimes they charge you for extra sauces , sometimes they do not .
... i will not make a trip that 's out of the way .
Saying good - bye to our 19 - year - old cat mittens was so hard , but we were so relieved that her last memories were not of a frightening car ride to a vet 's office full of other animal smells .
These guys are always awesome hook up the best burritos on earth do not believe come in and take a look especially when you had a hard night drinking come here and ask for el paisano burritto and they do you a favor !
I 'd love to give a clear description of the premise , but to honest , i have no idea what 's so manly about mantown .
Put simply , the show just was not that funny .
But that 's not the worst yet after i refused and cancelled their one month off service they said they will mail my refund in 15 days .
It 's 2 months now and i have not gotten my refund yet and every time i call to see where my money is a dumber person answers the phone giving me the stupidest reason or how it could take long to get a refund .
Do not and i repeat do not even give them any credit card or banking information they are worst than those out of country fraud scams .
He wanted some freddy 's action which i was not about to argue because i wanted to try the chicago dog and chili cheese fries .
I did not care too much for the chicago dog but not because of the quality , turns out it 's just not my thing but i am glad i tried it .
Certainly not a heathly choice but c amon you do not go to a place like freddy 's for a salad i love their double california burger and the dirt and worms custard .
The sandwich itself is not greasy at all , but just crispy from being pressed ; the beef salami and the bologna were meaty and tasty , and i loved the simplicity of them only being topped with mustard .
The place has been featured on magazines and on food shows , but the fame does not seem to faze them at all ( there was even a local newspaper photographer who was there , just taking pictures ) .
" no - you can not bill me for a room .
They clearly have not improved as my 88 year old mother is there as i write this .
Further , our family members have had to ask - and go find - a blanket , socks , and they do not feed her in er. because our family members are currently sick with flu / strep / pneumonia - we are " rotating " visits among whomever is healthiest to be there and meet her needs .
It 's extremely stressful not knowing if she 's been fed , assisted with hygiene , etc . we have medical personnel in our family that have commented that while they understand the demands of the er , the personnel is only doing the bare medical necessities and lack compassion .
I checked in was told by the radiologist and the rn that they 'd be administering fentanyl and volume and i would go down and out quickly for a short period of time and not remember anything .
They tried to apologize only to get my palm in their face and i told them not to talk to me .
I was told they were getting a wheel chair and i responded with do not do me any favors .
They only recieved one star from me because i could not give them a big fat zero as they so caringly deserve !!
The male waiter there was not friendly .
Always seem pist off and does not seem to want to serve ..
Seems like one of those asian kid that their parents force to work for free until they grow up , but it seems like he was stuck there and never got out ... :-t overall .
I generally like freddie custard , but after going to this location today i will never go to this one again .
When i looked in my bag , the cups were not even full of ice - cream .
I would not recommend thus location .
I would suggest the location on baseline because i never had that issue there and have been many times .
After a 24 hour stay at an emergency hospital , we just could not get her to snap back at home .
She ended up with what the doctors thought was fatty liver disease and simply had no interest in food , treats , tuna fish , or water .
I could not be that selfish nor would i put her through the trauma of yet another car ride .
Dr. fixler and his assistant were very kind and knowledgeable and did not rush us with the time we needed with our girl .
Do not get me wrong , it 's still as painful as can be , but in the comfort of our home without the dreaded drive was worth every penny and then some .
( they are even sending us a paw - print of miss bailey , which was not expected . )
We found the emergency room of this hospital by accident , because your family physician urgent care would not see us and it is around the corner .
Man you can not beat yoshinoy a when it comes to finding a great value .
I mmediately when i entered the shop i was greeted by greg who determined my needs and picked out the perfect plant - but it was not in a suitable arrangement for gift giving .
Greg at first thought he did not have a proper container in which to present so he quickly searched his stock finding one lone wicker basket ( which needed some modifications ) , repotting it , and applying ' leaf shine ' spray . with 2 lilies about to open , the arrangement was beautiful .
This family run business is top - notch and i would not hesitate to call on them in the future !
Honestly not worth it .
I get that it 's no hormone and free range and stuff , but for a $ 11 combo i expect some seasoning in the patty .
I am an individual who gets a lot of sauces with my burgers and subs whenever i get the choice ( btw they do not even have honey mustard ) , and even with 3 sauces slathered on the meat still tastes bland .
In fact they just grind up fresh beef and do not add anything , it 's admirable commitment to healthiness , at the cost of taste .
Have not had anything bad here .
I hope the staff keep up their good work and do not succumb to overbooking and swearing at me .
Upon entering the sweet smelling little flower shop , i was not disappointed .
If you order soy milk , make sure you ask for it with no ice .
Sometimes it is not .
Not stuffed with soggy veggies like other places .
I also got the miso soup which you really can not mess up .
It 's not about the interior decorating ( which is not even old .... )
I am not low - maintenance and they went above and beyond .
Keep in mind no one likes visiting hospitals alright ??? :)
Gets pretty packed at night but never takes to long .
Words really can not describe how wonderful they are ... the way they handle the process is so gentle , kind and compassionate .
For the first time in my life i was faced with the decision of keeping her alive a bit longer or allowing her to peacefully pass with no pain .
The decision was ours with no pressure just gentle advice and compassion from dr. fixler .
Not sure what all the hate is on this place .
I ordered orchids for my aunts birthday she could not believe how beautiful they are , the most beautiful she has ever seen .
I thought it could not get any worse , then we ordered centurylink prism .
Picture was not great .
The burger was stuffed with cheese and jalapeños . while i did not like the fries they were fresh cut not packaged frozen .
The kitchen is towards the rear of the restaurant and makes you not want to know how your food is prepared .
The beef was not the best , but the noodles and soup base were amazing .
I think that they should use larger sized rice papers as there is no way you can properly make a roll without it falling apart .
I was not a fan of the short grain rice as it gets progressively harder to get off the plate - even with a spoon .
I would advise that you stick to the pho options on the menu as everything else is not really that great .
The burger was just minced veggies and a whole lot of oil and no flavour .
Toronto is lucky to have so much available talent that a place like this can exist and charge such low admission prices -- and still not gouge patrons on the beer and food .
So this place is not only a food joint but a market that sells just about everything short of car parts .
I 'd say the tacos are pretty good not the best but the price and the experience of feeling like you are a part of some food spiritual experience with the multicultural and diverse clientele shirleen experience everyone should have will passing through tempe shady eastern neighborhood .
I am not sure what 's with the negative reviews , but this place is far better than any other burger joint in the area , especially with the 2 - for - 1 deal .
If you are an east side or do not live within walking , cheap uber , or convenient public transportation distance of mabel 's , you should just check out smokin ' qs. i was totally impressed and glad i gave it a chance despite the low - ish rating on here .
The waitress was a doll , both a manager and the chef stopped by to ask how everything was , and i 'd eat the brisket poutine daily if my one super power was to be able to eat whatever i wanted with no consequences .
I thought that the amazing smell of the food would win out , but somehow it did not .
I would have thanked her and told her manager that she was a good employee , but i did not want to bring shame to myself and my family .
I did not even see the name on her tag , just got my refill and sort of scurried off in what i thought was considerate respect .
Whether it 's a pint or a sundae , it 's never a disappointment because their thick , creamy and flavorful plain or mix-ins .
Not your usual thick juicy patties used to eating , but flavor is good .
Just do not expect to get fully satisfied with the meal , especially when the fries are the thin shoestrings .
Unfortunately the fresh prawn spring rolls were not as appealing when we noticed the shrimp had not been deveined and was full of shrimp feces .
The first time we we nt here we did not love it , it was when it had recently opened , however , we have been back twice since and have had great experiences , the food is very good , the servers are attentive and the restaurant is great .
Really like the cornbread , have not had a bad side !
As far as location and interior goes , it is considered to be in a little bit of a " rundown area " but do not be so quick to judge a book by its cover .
I do not trust that hospital .
I have given one star because zero stars is not an option .
The place is a time capsule for diners of the 30's and they keep it the same as a principles : it 's impossible to get the toast without mustard , they never cut the toast in half and employees are not willing to accept a tip .
This will not be a transcendental experience for the taste buds yet the old deli , the lines of pressed sandwiches on the grill , decorated by very yellow mustard , and the home - made soda drinks makes you feel like in a live food museum - and that 's worth every penny .
The satay beef was nice and spicy but did not leave my mouth in pain afterward .
Definitely not a lot of english spoken here , but who cares ?
I can not express my thanks enough for the way t dr .
Not a good experience with my recent visit to yoshinoya .
The clam chowder that came with my rice bowl tasted better than the rice bowl and that is not saying much .
The clam chowder was too watery and not one single clam in the cup .
I hate their black walls , black floors like it did not reflect food factory as much as vehicles factory !
We had 3 juicy lucy .. we finished the patty and almost no cheese inside !
Baby high chair was not clean .
The experience could not have been more peaceful .
Though i was super sad that the end had come for my dog to be in my life , i could not have imagined a better or more loving exit than that .
Warning do not get this service !!!
I do not have any clue about how to hack this service but have been thrown under the bus by centurylink who said the could sell me a antivirus package for a monthly fee to avoid this , really ?
I already can get cheap gyudon from japan creek or just make it at home , so i never saw a reason to come here , though i worked within walking distance for almost 6 years .
I spotted yoshinoya in japan but never sought it out to eat at one .
I also sprinkled on some shichimi togarashi and though not traditional , some chopped green onion that was out for miso soup orderers ( only because green onions are my favorite vegetable ! ) the menu otherwise has some odd things ( i am not a fan of teriyaki type joints so i do not like the weird vegetables like zucchini in my bowls or stir fries ) , like vegetables , udon bowls , chicken and combo bowls , and grilled fish - i asked what type of fish and the lady pronounced something weird twice to me that started with an s , a name of a fish i certainly have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spell ... i did notice yoshinoya now has ponzu sauce ( not for the beef bowl but rather the fish ) .

These people never disappoint !
We could not have been more at ease with the difficult decision .
I could not have wished for a better first visit .
The beef was seasoned perfectly , tasted wonderful and was not the least bit heavy .
Shoestring fries could not have tasted any better .
My side order of gravy topped it off perfectly ... thick ( but not too thick ) and tasty .
Not costing much more than most other gourmet burger joints , i was more than happy to pay the bill knowing i was getting quality angus beef , farm - raised , grain - fed , with no added antibiotics !
Considering that dinner was at 11 pm , i am more impressed that i will not be going to bed with a heavy , sinking feeling in my stomach .
- cheap tickets ( better to buy via groupon in my opinion because i would not be impressed if i have to buy the regular tickets ) - easily accessible via subway - small af venue and if it 's crowded , you have no guarantee with getting a place to sit because the performer and their friends takes over half of the venue - the seating is all just basic chairs and you have nowhere to put your drink or food ( i.e. no cup holders and table ) .
But i left with more stones to pass and a prescription for ibuprofen & a very rude unsympathetic nurse who treated my like an addict when i requested something stronger so that i would not need to return for the same thing in the near future !
I feel that centurylink prism still can not deliver a consistent television picture to the southeast henderson part of valley , and until they bring more upgrades in all areas , i feel prism can not be taken seriously as a real competitor to cox or directv .
Getting back to the prismtv , i am only about 3 / 4 miles from the transfer relay station , and i should not be having knock off and freezes on my broadcast service , but it does happen about a couple of times an hour .
The picture quality is very clear , but watching football can be a little disheartening , because the refresh rate is showing blurs , and this should not be happening on my plasma because it has a 600 mhz refresh rate .
On the other hand , if it 's not a fast moving picture , the picture quality is great !
Prism is for you , because you can not record more than one show at a time , and also you can not watch more than two hd channels at the same time .
There is not any time warner sport network or cbs sport network , so if you are a laker fans or unlv running rebel fan ... you are out of luck .
Do not get me wrong , the price is right , but i personally need better service for my household .... sorry centurylink , but you need to bring it up a level . thankfully , prism has a 30 day escape clause , and i did excise the option to cancel on my contract .
Do not get me wrong , this system is perfect for a small household , but will not work for my household which has four televisions .
With centurylink , and looking forward to their upgrade .. update : centurylink no longer provides their prismtv to my part of the woods .
It 's beef bowl has a unique seasoning which no one can duplicate .
The few who did not like it is mainly due to the cut of their beef .
There 's no yoshinoya in larger cities such as chicago or any other midwestern cities for that matter .
So i will not comment nor do i order other items on the menu .
Chicken is not too bad .
I also love love love the fries but if you are not a soggy fry fan they might not be for you .
Do not try this place if you are in a rush the anxiety ruins the burger .
As i mentioned you are not getting out of there quickly so it quickly fills up with people waiting for their food and people trying to get to the cash and people trying to get out .
No chicken bowl , no vegetable bowl or anything else .
I am not sure why some people do not like it but i love it .
I could not believe how much i loved this sandwich .
It 's served not on a plate , but on a thin napkin on the counter in front of you .
If i sound like i am complaining about that guy , i am not .
As others have pointed out , there 's no substitutions allowed .
They did not find it unusual at all as we led them into the closet ( of all places ) to find our little kitty where he was the most comfortable .
Having to not bring our cat to the vet made it 100 % better because of how stressed he would get when having to go there .
We did not want his last memory to be in any way negative .
I ordered two combo plates and a large beef , the beefs were 90 % fat i would had demanded a refund if i would not have lived so far away .
I still can not believe how disgusting the beef looked , i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but it was like chewing half cook fatty bacon , do yourself a favor and skip this place $ 27 in the trash .
Asada was tender and had a good flavor , not to fatty .
If your not super hungry the nachos serve 2 people .
I really liked the atmosphere , food and do not even get me started on the fry sauce - yum -o!!!!!
Oh , but wait i do not think i can put fry sauce on that lol !
Not too much meat and not too much bread .
The meat patties are freshly prepared and even their fries are freshly cut-despite not being entirely crispy were still great tasting fries .
Procedure did not take ten minutes .
Needless to say never again will i step into that lousy place called a hospital !
I came here when a vietnamese craving could not wait anymore , and i needed something close to work !
The menu is actually pretty large , and has many items i have not seen at other vietnamese places in the city , however , the craving was for a hot bowl of noodles with bbq meat , and so i stuck with my usual vietnamese order .
Even though there were other groups it was so eerily quiet that i felt like we could not talk at all .
Overall , if the craving strikes again and i am in a desperate situation , i would not write off anh dao , but i certainly will not be looking to get back there any time too soon .
I have never been a smoked meat guy , mostly because it is so hard to perfect .
I do not know how to describe it any better .
The brisket can not be beat .
The patio is great , as long as it is not too humid outside .
I have eaten there and had food to go several times and it has never disappointed !!
I can not give the food bad marks , but would advise prospective diners to check out the menu and understand your tab in advance .
Do not count calories because you will lose count .
I had pho. it was not bad .
A bit on the salty side and left me thirsty , something i do not usually experience at xe lua .
Service is alright , like all asian restaurants but i was not expecting any more or less .
They just need to time the cooking of your food so your burgers are not piping hot and sides ice cold .
They were so professional and respectful , thinking of things that i would not have to make it more meaningful .
Do not be alarmed by the size of the place and if there are no seats when you walk in .
Ordered mushrooms at extra cost and when i arrived at my destination and unwrapped it there were no mushrooms .
Not worth the price for a four ounce patty , i asked the size of the standard patty while there .
Bun was not too thick and beef tasted fresh .
Not a huge flower person , but now i am a believer .
I tried their sour soup & found it was not sour enough to my liking ( bun saigon further south on spadina makes the best soup ) .
I do not know what the craze is .
Strongly not recommended .
I was fortunate as there were not many people there but they took me back instantly and i quickly received an iv and medication .
I was there a total of 7 days and the doctors would not release me until i was ready .
I do not like this place as much as second city but it 's still pretty good .
The window i was given was 8 am - 5 pm -- no i am not kidding .
But cl never showed anyway .
I was told my ovarian cyst ruptured and should not be causing me any pain .
He was very unprofessional and not sympathetic at all .
But freddy 's does not serve subs , you say .
It actually added flavor , but i can see how some people would not be a fan of that .
It would not be a meal if it did not end with dessert , so i ordered a mini vanilla custard with cookie dough on top .
If you care about your loved ones , arrowhead may not be the place for them and pray " tina " on the 2nd floor is not their nurse .
All fatty and stringy .. that s not beef by any stretch of the imagination .
Never wasted $ 7 on anythhing worse than i did today .
No crispiness or soft interior .
Overall have not tried the other burgers but i can see they are small .
Ingredients are fresh and that is standard as is the antibiotic - free beef ( all beef sold in ontario is antibiotic - free in that if antibiotics are given the animal products are not sold until they are cleared ) .
I ordered online for a delivery , i was not sure how this would turn out but my expectations were blown .
I feel good knowing when i order in the future , i do not have to worry if they will get delivered correctly or how they will look .
I would not make a trip out of my way nor would i pass up any number of other choices .
Not impressed .
It did not seem like there was much meat at all .
So , it 's not that i would not come back but i can not find a reason that says i am definitely coming back .
I do not know why there is such a hype .
Do not go out of your way but if you do , make sure you are paying with canadian dollars .
The exchange rate is 1 to 1 , and she will not give you american dollars back for change .
Overall , it was not a great experience .
In 4 calls over the last 3 days they have not been able to even verify my account in less than 20 minutes in order to let me tell them why i called .
I am not a stacked to the sky condiments type of guy but a decent burger for $ 7 and way better then the chains .
I do not see why they closed , unless colleges students are much ickier than i thought .
There is not too much on the menu , only a few selections so it makes things easier for indecisive people .
I took ibeprofen consistently but the pain would not subside .
They had no rooms when i got to the er.
The nurses and staff were very friendly so it was not a big deal .
After hours he did not even tell me how big the cyst was and gave no further information besides to take 600 mg ibeprofen .
When i explained that i had already been taking 800 ibeprofen for days and that 's why i came to hospital , and if prescription ibeprofen worked i would not have needed to come .
I started bawling from pain and frustration and he responded with " i am not prescribing you opiates " .
I work 70 hour weeks and i consider myself to be responsible woman , and i can not work those hours in this kind of pain .
I felt as if i was being made out as a person with a drug issue because i am younger ( 24 ) and ibeprofen does not work on me .
Especially by not even taking more than 30 seconds to explain what was wrong with me .
He did not even let me finish my sentence before he immediately got defensive , raised his voice , saying he told me it was a cyst and if i wanted to know the size then he would just show me the paperwork and then snapped that he would write me a different prescription and walked out .
I have been using arrowhead for quite some time but after today i will never go again .
I got basically no answers and felt like i was treated extremely disrespectfully .
Not an expert with asian cuisine but i know good food when i taste it .
Hate it do not recommend i rather drive to cali .
Plus they give small amount of meat it 's mostly rice and the price increase man i am so disappointed and i love yoshinoya not this one
That 's not the worst part of you can believe that ...
They promise they will fix it and it never happens .
They made a $ 4 k mistake and i caught it ... now , i can not get them to fix their mistake .
My honey bear could not have passed any more peacefully and i take comfort in knowing that .
Do not normally write reviews but this place deserves the 5 stars i gave !
You will not regret it .
Strongly recommend to anyone even if you do not live in tempe .
Per susan c's review , i do in fact give this my " white people do not eat here " seal of approval !
I have never seen before .
Did not seem to have a system or the system was certainly nit a great one .
You would think , one person is grilling , another is doing the fries , another is wrapping and serving ...... not quite everyone bumping around each other and not communicating or calling out to each other , and no leading the team order took forever , 3 people standing around looking at the cold remnants of fries , anyone think to put on fresh ones ?
No the call was to give us cold fries .
Anyway we ended asking for fresh ones the burger was ok , was thin and fairly salty , bun was good which is a surprise , but all in all not a great burger especially compared to five guys , but not as expensive as them .
No place quite like this i have ever seen or been to .
Could not help myself and struck up a conversation with what appeared to be the boss , and she could not have been more friendly !
I can see why they call this light lunch , do not come here if you are extremely hungry .
I did not have to ' know ' anything , as they walked me through the entire process .
Do not , i repeat , do not get centurylink for your internet service ... no matter what kind of deal you are offered .
I tried to call and after a half - hour in hold my phone died my wife was on hold for an hour and they said her name was not on the account .
Do not have anything to do with this incompetent company .
I will never use them again .
Coming back for a second time could not have been better .
Not spectacular but pleasant enough .
We can not say enough about the care our sweet buddy has received .
No ... it 's not the best of teriyaki bowls .
This is not a teriyaki place .
But i do not get it .
Unfortunately , i did not like the first arrangement they sent to her .
Although my girlfriend loved them , i was not happy and called the florist to complain .
No questions asked , they sent her another amazing bouquet and had them delivered within the hour .
Can not pay for better customer service .
I never even loved mustard until i tried it on this sandwich .
As far as late night food goes , this place was not greasy or frozen like fast food .
I was excited to try one of their delicious creations however as a vegetarian i can not eat a meat patty .
No matter how much i tried to explai to the staff member and no matter how much money i offered for the difference ( approx $ 1.50 ) they would not accommodate me .
With many other burger options nearby i will not be coming back .
I need not say anymore other then just go already .
I did not think that the food prices were out of line for the quality and quantity , though it seems a small piece of cornbread could come with the combo dinners rather than providing an indescript " brioche " roll .
I do not think any other high - end restaurant in the cleveland area charges nine dollars for a microbrew draft .
But you should not say you are available 24 / 7 days when you are not .
We needed someone at 330 am yesterday when our very large dog was suffering & we could not move him .
We called & got a recording that they were not doing 24 hr service right now .
There 's only 2 places in town that claim they are 24 hr at home care .... well the other place is not either .
Great people , great prices , great quick service ... and do not forget to grab a couple fireball shots for a buck on the way out .
I had to put in one star but this company gets no stars from me .
The best is the ass ---- on the phone laughed at me and said he would not remove the charge and would not get me a supervisor .
Never never sign with centurylink .
I have been coming here for years as a recommendation from vietnamese friends , i do not think i can go wrong ... when the locals recommend it ...
When you come here , you are not looking for decor and / or atmosphere .. you are simply coming for the food .. no expectations for seating and decor ..

I usually order the beef pho here and i am never disappointed in the bold soup base , spring rolls work well as a side dish .. when i come here with more people , it is good to share the rice paper rolls where you do it yourself ... it s somewhat interesting as i do not see this as often in other vietnamese restaurants ..

You can never go wrong with the pho here as it 's as good as it gets .... pricing is reasonable for the size and quality that you get ...
Their burgers are not the traditional type .
He just stared at me in stone cold 4 year old flare said , " i do not even know what that tastes like !
Do not even get me started on the fry sauce !
Suzi was a scrapper , no doubt about that .
With a background in internal medicine and orthopedic surgery , he told me while in general practice , he found a need for this type of service and thought it was always " the right thing to do , " but he could not always be there for his patients .
I did not get that when i lost either of my kitties .
I do not know who gave it good reviews but i would never go back there again !
I love their burgers and of course their fry sauce which i believe is mayo , ketchup , and their french fry seasoning not sure .
I just can not say enough how amazing this place is !!
Thank you for doing that because most customers do not want to spend over $ 20 on lunch .
I have ordered from many flower shops before and i was not as satisfied as i am with dancing dandelion .
No flavour yet so greasy .
Last night i was downtown and i seriously had to go to the bathroom , i saw jacksons burger on elm and seriously said to myself " ah crap , well i got ta take a leak , i will just buy some fries " so i go in , once again unfriendly staff , not rude or anything but not friendly , i order a poutine and diet coke , got no problem with 10 bucks cuz i know rent is expensive downtown . this poutine was disgusting .
Gross gravy , cheese curds that did not melt at all and lousy fries .
I never did get to use the bathroom cuz i think drug addicts were in there .
Ya right ..... never going back again .
I really like to give it a 3.5 , but i will be nice and since yelp does not have 1 / 2 star ratings , i will give it the 4 star .
Their burger meat is of above average quality , but it s not great .
I have tasted better , but i 'd definitely recommend this place to the burger lover that is in this area , i would not go out of my way to try em though .
I do enjoy them i am a huge poutine lover , and the burger factory 's poutine is not made with cheese curds , rather just shredded mozz .
So it s not a traditional poutine , but the one thing that makes this place is the gravy .
I will not go to some places because they do not have gravy or it s not good enough if they do .
For example , i love ' five guys ' burgers , but they do not have gravy so i do not go often .
The meat did not fall off the bone as they said it would .
Sadly do not recommend .
He could not have been more helpful and kind .
The beans were different , not bad but not what we were expecting as it was more like a soup .
Then she calls me back and said i did not pay for it and i would have to pay if i get another .
I can not say enough nice things about them .
Many good burger joints out there and this place did not stand out .
All they care about is making money they do not care about their patients well - being i felt violated and used i will never go there again did not treat my injuries from me falling off my ladder also lied to you to get you to do what they want which is extremely unethical be very very careful going to this facility they are extremely conniving and i can not caution you
My grandma turned 80 years young today and i was not able to get back to las vegas to celebrate with my family .
I always get nervous ordering flowers over the phone .. within 20 minutes she called me at work to ask if liked the picture because she did not want me to be unhappy .
I can not access my personal email email and was going to check in a couple of hours on my lunch on my cell which was in my car .
She was so happy and had never seen a carnation dog !
I have been to this location several times and though i do not typically review fast food joints this one definitely deserves some kudos .
I typically go here during lunch time when it is fairly busy and have never waited more than a few minutes for my food .. pretty impressive considering this is not like mcd 's where everything is already made and sitting under a warmer .

Even though it is not on the menu any longer you can get a burger dog - delicious !
Never have a bad night here .
I swung by on the day where the fish burger was on special , ( and regretted not researching what day i wanted to visited ahead of time ) , but i was still impressed with how close the burger was with the advertised picture .
I remember seeing the 3 pieces of shrimp in the picture and thought , " naw there 's no way there would be that much shrimp of that size in the fish patty " . but , lo and behold there were in fact that many pieces of shrimp in there .
First , the burger , was good but not amazing .
The so called p.a. that was taking care of her seemed like she did not care or want to take the time out to figured out what was really going on with her .
All she did was order a number of labs to be done then after they were done she came in said everything came back okay and said " some people just pass out for no real reason it s nothing to worry about just go home a rest . "
She just did not want to take the time out to figure out what could be going on .
Trust me i would not take a frog there for a band - aid .
The food is cheap and cheerful ( who does not like coleslaw now that our parents are not forcing us to eat it ? ) , and the kitchen is open late .
I like the peeps that hang around ( some girl i did not even know bought me a pint last night just because ) , and love that the space was built by most of the people who perform there now .
I had my son in the er early this morning - i am very unhappy that i was charged a $ 600.00 deposit on my credit card , when i only authorized a $ 100.00 deposit - i have called the billing office and the hospital direct to get this taken care of and of course , no one is will answer their phone - next step is to contact my credit card and dispute this charge .
Beware - they make you pay up front and if you are lucky enough to get a refund from your deposit , it will take months - also , you will receive an additional bill from the er doctor because he is not part of our insurance group - even though arrowhead is part of our insurance group .
He could not have been more respectful to our situation .
I do not recommend this hospital to animals !!
And many things that were done where we had to tell them what to do , and i am not in the medical field !!
Do not go there !!!
I do not get these reviews .
And they missed putting tomato had i not keep an eye on the assembly .
After it was wrapped up , they did not know which burger was which so they had to unwrap it to check .
Not at all impressed .
Side dishes expensive and not very good .
Do not plan on returning until waitress learns not to argue with customers .
Unless pricing , food quality , quantity and choices change , i will not be coming back .
Centurylink is not worth the hassle .
They were under cooked , clearly not slow cooked .
If you can not get the ribs right at a barbecue spot , that is not a good sign .
If you do not want the truth please do not ask .
Bun was not too thick and beef tasted fresh .
Do not get me started on the poutine .
There is really nothing more i can say that has not already been said by most every reviewer here .
I have no doubt that contacting happy endings was the best decision for my furry friend , and myself .
I think that 's because my little girl was sent off peacefully in a place she felt most comfortable , and i felt no guilt or doubt , wondering if i did the right thing at the right time .
Food was not prepared at all good .... no smoking flavor .
Food was not prepared at all good .... no smoking flavor .
While watching tv she would lay on the floor with her head on my feet to make sure daddy did not " escape " .
She never liked her trips to the vet so as the day grew closer i searched and found happy endings .
Dr. fixler and ryan showed up on time and showed so much compassion not only to rosie , but to my wife and i. there was no rush and he wanted us to also be ready .
She did not move as they prepared her and when the final seconds come i could feel the weight lifting off my feet as her sole left her body .
Got a 3 meat mix with chicken , pork ribs and sausage and a brisket with tips and slices with a side of baked bean cassoulet so we could try a wide variety and we were not disappointed .
Next time we bring more people to share the appetizer so we do not end up bringing half our meals home .
So l could not wait to try it .
Liked the openness but could not help but notice how dirty the floor was .
Not a hint if a smile or any effort to do anything than the bare minimum .
Never said a word , just picked them up and left .
Never had that happen before .
Passed the manager in the hallway as we were leaving , he looked right at us and never said a word .
No " thank you for coming or how was your food ?. " nothing .
It is clear these people do not want you coming to their restaurant .
Can not taste the ribs .
Corn bread was over spiced and took away from what could have been flavorful certainly not a good representation of good texas style bbq .
The pho broth is also really good , but they skimp out a bit on the meat and noodles , so i am not sure why they charge more than other places .
If i was rating the online promises and promotions that come from whichever state answers your call , i would probably give them a 1 . but if you contact or go to the office in henderson and deal with justina , you will not be able to get better service from any provider .
She never gave up on me and made sure i got the tech support i needed to get online .
No matter if you deal with cox , time warner , or century link , it is the customer service that makes the company who they are .
Not to start wwiii here ( i will leave that to our president ) but we make some mighty fine tacos in the central valley .
To be honest , most of the food was not very memorable , but you do not really come here ( or order uber eats from here ) for that .
Think it is not ?
Was my nurse in the ed at abrazo and i can not thank her enough for helping me as much as she did .
I can not make this up .
I did not know that it was possible to screw up a basic type of dish such as fish and chips .
I will not be ordering from this establishment again in the future .
It did not taste like the beef bowl i used to have in southern california .
I could not tell what was it but it just did not taste right .
I liked the soup as it was loaded with veggies and had no noodles ( hasta la vista , carbs ! )
I was about to give anh dao 5 stars , but i have to agree with some of the other reviews - the veggies on my plate both times were not very fresh .
The food was fine , certainly did not live up to the hype but it was good .
I felt like the baby back ribs were tough and the brisket was not really that smokey or memorable either .
I feel that i should mention that our server sarah had the absolute worst breath that i have ever smelled on a person , made me not want to eat anything , it was really really really bad - but all in all i would go back
If you want to fall head - over - heels - in - love - with - you with a hamburger , look no further .
Service at the counter was pretty good , although i have to say , the place was not very clean .
The patty was dry as the sahara , the toppings could not make up for the beef .
Likely not unless i get a hankering for some fries !
* the shop was featured on mind of a chef with anthony bourdain and david chang of momofuku * note that if you do not like mustard , do not come to this place .
They will not take out the mustard or cut the sandwich in half for you , that 's just how they have been serving since 1932 !
* there are not any fancy plates utensils here .
If you do not know what kind of cheese to choose , i would recommend the swiss cheese over the cheddar as the former is a bit milder , which would enhances the flavor of the sandwich .
I regret not ordering the pickles and their soda as i heard wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda , and there are so many flavors to choose from !
I will never go back !
Not only was the climate control broken for our room that we stayed in for days , but we were billed almost 3 times as much as they presented to us when we checked out , after we left .
Although i would never eat bologna as an adult , it was somehow okay in this sandwich .
Not actual food but drinks .
There was no really basic food ( i am more of a simple plain cheeseburger kind of person when ordering at restaurants ) except for on the lunch menu .
So we figured that we would not go there again .
We decided to get outdoor seats since it was a nice evening and we did not want to have to deal with the overly air conditioned indoor seating .
We asked the waitress to put us at another table and she did so with no attitude so we had hope for this visit .
The hostess had very long hair that was just down , which i thought was interesting that they did not make her put it up in a pony like they would do in most workplaces .
Plus we had fries as a side to our burgers and there was no ketchup on the table just hot sauce and bbq sauce , which was odd because that is a pretty standard condiment to have at a restaurant .
In the end we will never ever got to this place again .
I definitely would not recommend .
Also there was really nothing on the menu for kids so it 's not really an ideal family place .
I would not consider the burger really hot , but i am a fan of spicy foods so your mileage may vary .
I can not even begin to explain how absolutely wonderful the emergency room staff and surgery staff were .
Surgery staff : jennifer , colleen , dr. brotsky and many more that i regret not knowing their names .
Their customer service is absolutely horrible . 1 . wait time over 15 mins 2 . unorganized , so calling back to follow up is useless , they do not keep records .
3 . no support , they do not know what s wrong when your lines go down , and send maintenance that ca nt fix it .
It s always " talk to your phone vendor it s not us " i am trying to get my phone numbers ported over to another carrier right now , and they are putting me through such a hassle for over a month , that i decided to not even keep the numbers anymore . this is by far one of the worst companies i have ever dealt with in the country .
I have actually never gone to the hospital and left without a discussion of my potassium levels and supplementation .
I have no insurance yet the er was empty of patients so why was the care so rushed and devoid of any effort ?
The wait would not of been bad if the atmosphere was conducive to enjoy an evening out without having to scream to talk .
Do not waste your time .
This area needs better restaurants and this unfortunately is not one of them .
The only thing tasty was the pickles - not enough for a return visit .
Generally , the restaurant did not seem all that clean .
I am not one to give bad reviews when unwarranted , but it was stunning how bad and overpriced this place was .
I heard from some others that the food was mediocre , but thought to myself that those people really were not " bbq people " and it simply was not their type of place .
This place does not even compete with most places in town .
I really hope they turn it around or else that place will not survive long .
I am here at least once an month and really feel that the city would be much poorer for not having this venue .
The floors are beat up and look dirty , even if they are not .
Do not let her eat that anymore . " incident 2 : my daughter was 1 year old and had a fever of 105 that we could not get to come down .
Do not let her eat that anymore . " incident 2 : my daughter was 1 year old and had a fever of 105 that we could not get to come down .
The doctor could not figure out what was wrong and even had us hold her down to catheterize her so they could check for a urinary tract infection .
( yes , the doctor checked her ears when we were at the hospital and apparently did not notice . )
The np gave good insight / advice and we opted not to do a ct scan .
Not really so much like the ones in japan though .
And i did not think yoshinoya was one of the better gyu - don places in japan anyways .
I do not know why it s got ta be so damn yellow .
Horrible from day one , everything from customer service to the internet service , i was supposed to get speed of 25 mbps but all got if i was lucky 5 to 7 mbps , this was not enough to get wireless printer to work .
My smart tv became useless for 1 1 / 2 months i tried and tried but never got any better , got worst and worst everyday .
At the end i wanted not part of this company , so i requested my money back because of the horrible experience i had with their service and their customer service .
If you do not pay your bill on time they hit you late fees , but they play stupid with your money , still no refund so beware .
I do not recommend this service to anyone because of my own personal experience is been negative from day one .
They advertised it for years but everytime you ask , they replied is not here yet .
Overprice service for what you get in return , is not worst it the headache they put you thru .
The kitchen has not been open long enough for me to get a full sample of the menu , but i can tell you that it is both ambitious and impressive , and nowhere near your usual " pub grub " type offerings .
Not only are troupes performing nightly , but some of the city 's best festivals such as the fringe festival , the toronto improv festival and the toronto sketch festival all call comedy bar home for performances .
Then she calls me back and said i did not pay for it and i would have to pay if i get another .
The brisket was wonderful , the pork was very well done and smokey but did not really have any flavor and the sause is very watery .
I sat at the bar and the service was good but you could tell the staff was still learning the ropes and did not know the menu or have a good ordering system .
The brisket was tender and tasty but no charred bits .
I have been to this location multiple times and have never felt that much pain from an iv stick .
She did not want to move the station to the other side and then blamed me for my vein getting lost while she was hurting me with the needle fiddling around inside trying to find the vein .
But both nurses failed to get me the nurse call button and i was not searching around the room for it so i had to undo my own hook up to be able to get up and use the restroom .
When i went to do so and notified them , the rude nurse who did my iv pointed at the restroom door like i was stupid and did not apologize for not being there to help .
I never want to work with this nurse again as my c section is suppose to be at this hospital .
Not only have my symptoms continued after the experience .
I did not get my baby checked by ultrasound following my multiple concerns .
Just because my dilation has not changed does not mean a mothers intuition is not right .
I left everything up to them and told them no lily 's .
My mother loves sunflowers and this time i picked an arrangement from their website and asked for no lily 's .
I could of done with out the autumn leafs but never the less it was gorgeous .
The sandwich was not deep - fat friend and it was literally a bun heated on a panini with layers of meat and kraft slice cheese .
I loved it , but i definitely would not give it the best sandwich i ever had award like one celebrity chef called it .
The pa christina has no clue what she is doing .
I will never come back to arrowhead again .
For a $ 4.99 burger , it ai not so bad !
Pros : good location , good service ( not a lot of customers ) , and good variety of sides .
I also love the idea of fresh - squeezed juice , although i do not know how that matches with burgers ( weird ) .
Only eat here if you do not have another choice .
I would not call this a gourmet burger place because some of the items just do not make sense .
All in all - not a bad try .
I was not expecting anything more than average at this location .
I have used their service 2 x in the last 6 months and do not know where i would be without them .
The staff could not have been any more helpful and understanding .
I rescued him in 2001 as a 1 year old border collie / lab mix and we never left each other 's side .
I hope i never have to make these decisions in the future , but if i do , i will certainly use happy endings again .
You are legitimate kind spirits and words can not express my true gratitude .
Gluten free friendly - and easy to sub anything you can not or do not want .
Not the same at all there is someone cooking all day and happily doing it .
The meat was competently smoked but did not stand out .
When we went out for lunch with my other student the other week , she could not eat anything but fries .
The food was not halal .
It was not too busy .
They were crispy and crunchy , and not oily .
The latter is not breaded .
Dr. fixler and his assistant explained the process and allowed me all the time i needed and most importantly , sparky suffered no stress or trauma .
Will not be coming back to this location and will ensure my family and friends do not either .
It s on the drab side , not the most inspiring place .. but then again , not a lot of comedy venues are anything more than black walls and chairs .
It s on the drab side , not the most inspiring place .. but then again , not a lot of comedy venues are anything more than black walls and chairs .
I do not send flowers very often , but had two clients who lost their husbands in one week , so sad , and i wanted to reach out to them with something cheerful to send my love ...
Do not let your floral money be a waste , call the dancing dandelion like i will again and again !
It might take a little practice to perfect the roll , but once you get it , you will not be able to stop stuffing your face .
Never had a bad meal .
After i watch the documentary what the health on netflix i choose not to eat either one but not because they are not tasty !
I personally did not like the steak burgers or the hotdogs even when i ate meat but they deserve four stars just for the custard and fries !
A repeat customer and it never disappoints !!!!
They also had ice cream stuff , but i did not look closely at this .
I really did not want to work with a chain flower shop that did not care about the result .
I can not say enough about dr. littlejohn and how amazing of a physician he is .
The whole staff worked so hard and were diligent about not only my comfort but my brand new son 's comfort as well as my family .
We ordered an appetizer which we did not like ... we could not figure out if it was a mexican or bbq restaurant !
We decided not to order meals and the waitress looked at us like we were idiots .
Do not waste your time or money .
I can not believe this place has only 65 reviews !
There 's no huge lineup out the door , obnoxious service or sense of urgency - althought the hype whipped up by anthony bourdain and others has given the place a strange sacred aura .
They did not really ride any wave of the publicity , and you will never find their bologna sandwich sold anywhere outside of their shop - and i think i like them for that .
I usually do not like soda , but i actually really enjoyed theirs !
Burgers are not the greatest but decent for the money .
We could not wait to go to this quigliata bbq restaurant , it was one of the top 10 most anticipated restaurants to open this year .
There really is not any bbq places local to go , so we were really excited .
This is more of a tex - mex restaurant and not a true bbq place .
Our waiter was chomping on gum , never brought plates , a knife that could cut and several other requested items .
We ordered a full rack of ribs to split along with several other dinners and the waiter did not bring plates to go with it for the other two people to eat their meal .
We asked several times for the dishes and never got them .
$ 28.00 large fatty ribs and the bbq sauce was not good at all , it was a mix of bbq and mexican sauce .
It would be great if there was some other type of bbq sauce to try but there was not .
No sides included with your meal , those are extra .
We never got the fries that were ordered either .
The pulled pork was also very plain and did not have much flavor .
I could not put the bbq sauce on it since i did not like it .
We will not go back unless there are big changes made to this menu .
It is not cheap to eat or drink at this restaurant so these 6 people will not be going back in the near future .
If the food was good , i would not mind paying more but this was just not a good experience from the food to the service .
Compared to real mexican food i will not give more than one stars .
No one called no on showed up .
No one showed or called .
I called customer service to cancel service because no one knows what the heck is going on .
Ashley assured me that because i had been scheduled and the issue was not resolved they would put me in the rush que and move my repair date up .
Raymond the supervisor can not help me or move up the repair date so i am canceling service .
I would not venture off the strip , but " the bachelore " of our group required a visit to yoshinoya .
I have never been to a yoshinoya in the states .
Time kept passing and by 7 pm , still no sign .
It 's like a company with zero supervision , these guys do not transfer you to the right dept etc.
The only reason they do not get a 5 star rating is for their customer service .
Do not expect to be treated like a customer or " the customer is always right " kind of treatment .
The portions are skimpy and not nearly worth the price that is being charged .
The one side we purchased , fries were good , but again not worth the $ 5 charge after spending so much on the meats .
Small portions are fine , but you can not sacrifice quality and charge a premium price .
Do not get this service !!
When we originally called to sign up we were supposedly paying $ 60.00 a month for the fastest internet connection possible and we were supposed to receive a $ 50.00 cash visa card in the mail for signing up ( obviously that never happened ) .
I would not recommend their " fastest " internet for a five year old who wanted to use paint .
Look no further for a " knockout " flower arrangement for a special occasion .... or just because !!!
Magician greg not only made it happen , but spent a long - long - distance phone call with me because i am a perfectionist and over thinker .
Look no further !!
I also tried the cod fish burger , it 's like no other fish burger .
I do not feel guilty coming here as i can see the chef rolling the patties and using fresh ingredients .
The presenters did not care even after knowing that fact .
He did not even mention sex at all !
I have been in second city before , and well , saw some stand up comedies on tv ; and this show was not funny , it was offensive .
And i know that all these comedy shows at some point or another have some sexual content , but they were never that blatantly direct !
And i think it would be funnier if you just hint at it , not go on and describe the sexual act in itself .
Good that i did not go in a date or brought any kids , that would have been horrible !
I had a chicken sandwich where the chicken was so tough i could not cut it .
Heard the food here was not that good and expensive .. they were right on both .
I have two dogs and he told me exactly how to do this to not cause confusion for the partner of the one leaving , and it worked .
Boomer was sad for awhile but he never searched for his departed mate like some dogs do , because he knew she was gone from our physical world .
Dr. fixler also knew how to support me and my guilt of letter her go ( of course we know we should not feel this way , but we all do ) .
Lost 500 cc of blood that never got replaced .
The nurse 's assistant was rude and unhelpful , she was so horrible i requested she not come in my room for anything ever again .
I ended up going to john c lincoln 2 weeks after that 2nd week i was there and they found 2 large cysts on both ovaries that arrowhead somehow never saw even after getting a ct scan there .
I will never , ever go to that hospital or take my baby there !!!
I went there for lunch with neil " vietnamese food nazi " t. and he gave it his " white people do not eat here " seal of approval .
But we only got 7 links of sausage which meant that my last bundle was without sausage : ( i secretly think neil got greedy and pinched an extra link for himself when i was not looking .
The banh beo ( $ 5.75 ) , however , had that not - so - fresh feeling .
The little rice cakes were not steamed to order , and the dollops of mung bean puree had the tell - tale crustiness of having been left out too long .
Blech . and just because we had to try their pho , we ordered the special beef noodle soup ( $ 6.25 for one size ) the broth was fragrant without being too rich , however , the noodles are dried , not fresh .
I do not like quite so many ingredients in my pho ( rare beef , brisket , beef balls , tripe , " etc. " ) so next time i am going to try it with just two max .
[ 1 ] i still have no clue what this fruit was .
I did an image search ; it 's not guava , soursop , or jackfruit .
No prefab burgers for this chickie !
Where most restaurants would probably just cut the fat off the meat , he uses the fat to cook the fries ( yes , not vegan friendly , but this is a bbq joint ... sorry vegan friends ! ) , he wastes as little as possible . also , he is adamant about ingredient quality ... and it shows !
No velveeta here !
As per the funnel cake , there is no other time than summer to get funnel cake and the burger factory has it all year long .
I can not even imagine anything worse than these guys .
They literally do not do a single thing good or even correct .
I did not bother complaining - i am sure what i got was what they intended to serve .
I can not photo the food since it is already in their trash .
I am not optimistic that this crew can improve their offering ( it really is that bad ) so i guess i will just wait for their inevitable closing and see what comes next .
I will not be back until then .
If you have not had enough of the burger .
The bbq sauce was not my favorite , too watery .
Been a customer since 1995 .... when it was sprint ... i have had major issues with centurylink for 3 years .... it was so bad i over paid over 100.00 a month because i could not deal with spending days on the phone to get this corrected !!!!
I cancelled my service and they did not disconnect , instead they sent 2 technicians out the next day ( no idea why !! ) still could not get centurylink to un freaking bundle direct tv from this whole nightmare ( i like direct tv ) stop charging me for direct tv , that was disconnected 3 months earlier ... to which not only did i have to pay direct tv , but i also had to pay centurylink for the same direct tv ( like 450.00 i paid 2 times )
I cancelled my service and they did not disconnect , instead they sent 2 technicians out the next day ( no idea why !! ) still could not get centurylink to un freaking bundle direct tv from this whole nightmare ( i like direct tv ) stop charging me for direct tv , that was disconnected 3 months earlier ... to which not only did i have to pay direct tv , but i also had to pay centurylink for the same direct tv ( like 450.00 i paid 2 times )
I can not wait until i can get internet in my area other than centurylink ....... so frustrating dealing with such ignorance , such lack of communication , this company must be going belly up !!!! a nightmare !!!!!!!!!!
Unfortunately we do not have anything good to say about the billing / payment process .
I tried calling to speak with someone regarding the charges that we were given and i could not get through .
I left several voicemails with no call back .
After talking to billing team they told me i could dispute the charges since i was not getting a response back .
I was told when i disputed the charges someone would call to discuss each dispute with me , if i did not receive a call the charges were disputed .
Again with no call , no explanation , just another bill .
The hospital does not mind charging me but will not talk to me to walk through the charges .
In the end , we determined that the treatments needed to keep jilly alive were not in her best interest , least of all because of the severe stress she suffered on trips to the vet .
Dr fixler and alicia spent 20 mins on the phone with me , helping me to come to terms with the decision ( she was so young ! ) at no cost to me .
Dr. fixler shared with me a personal story about his own beloved dog 's final day , and alicia sealed the deal when i asked her how they perform the service they do , day in , day out , and i will never forget , she said " well , we cry a lot .
Dr. fixler , a fully qualified veterinarian , gave jilly a preliminary exam to confirm the time was right - they do not perform euthanasia when they when the situation does not call for it .
They did not mind that we had a chosen a makeshift bed of my fuzzy bathrobe and one of my husband 's supremely stinky work shirts ( two of jilly 's favorite things to sleep on ) and did not laugh when we requested that her favorite lollypop stick be cremated with her .
The in - home service is more expensive , but we will never put our pets down any other way again .
As another reviewer stated , dr fixler will be seeing us again , but hopefully not for a long time .
No additives or preservatives .
I do not find their burgers horrible , nor are they exceptional .
Sarah & liz were cute and silly with their improv , however ; the scenarios they used were audience members ' stories that marito literally just discussed moments before they went on , which was a little annoying since the girls were not paying any attention backstage .
My one suggestion would to get a server in the main room so people do not have to get up to get a drink .
To my surprise there was not a single veg - friendly item on the menu .
The beef rib , fatty , under seasoned , extremely chared exterior , no smoke flavor but as far as the little amount of meat that was under all that was nice , tender and juicy .
Did not taste any seasoning or smoke .
The pulled pork had no flavor and was super dry .
The spare ribs were cooked perfectly but again no flavor .
Mac n cheese had a great melted gruyere top crust , but once you get through it , the pasta was over cooked and the cheese sauce was runny and really had no flavor .
Now i am not a pit master and it could just be me , because the place was jammed around lunch time .
So do not just trust the reviews try it for yourself .
All i can say is do not do it !
Not satisfied at all very slow & sometimes does not even work !
They did not show up when they were supposed to and was constantly given the run around terrible service !
Not worth the couple bucks you save over cox !!
They do not open until 12 pm so we were waiting briefly outside until they opened .
I can not tell you how good it is to have such excellent service at my disposal , especially since my job depends on having a land line available .
I ordered 4 chicken and 4 steak , but i could not tell the difference between the two meats .
I was not expecting ground meat , and if i knew it would have been ground mystery meat i will go to taco bell next time .
Cilantro could have been chopped a little finer , not just picked apart and included the bottom of the stem .
Not a big fan of super thinly sliced meat unless it 's in a sandwich or in a broth dish like pho .
The condiments area was completely empty , there was only an almost empty container of pickled ginger that did not look pleasing .
There was not even any soy sauce or salt and pepper dispensers .
Good thing i did not do autopay !
After many calls and store visits i resolved this issue ( i thought i did ) by canceling service and with the 30 day guarantee i should not have to pay anything .
2 months later ( not sure why it takes so long ) i get the new revised bill with all my credits .
And i see that i have a 17 dollar charge .. for a phone line which i never signed up for ...
Justina helped me and i suggest not talking to her .
She does not know what modems are or how they work additionally other employees are not allowed to help you unless you signed up through them so what s the point of having more than one employee if they are not allowed to help the customer .
Century link is slow , poor customer service and worst of all they lie and cheat the customer and billing is a nightmare , not to mention they offer gigabit internet but know nothing about it because it does not need a modem .
I switched back to cox , it s a little more expensive but i got the internet installed the next day and accurate billing with no taxes with in a week .
Wow i have never had hd look so good the prsim tv is just faboulus .
You can not beat that .
If that is not great service , i do not know what is !!!
Dr. fixler & assistant ( in my grief i did not properly catch her name ) arrived when expected & gave me a call 10 minutes prior to arrival .
Tldr ; what a bbq restaurant would be like if it was opened by someone who did not know how to make bbq .
No technical skill in smoking department .
The pork had no bark .
I will repeat for emphasis : the pork had no bark !
For pulled pork to have no bark means it had no flavor too .
I did not catch a flavor of jalapeño or cheddar , but it was tasty .
The rolls were simple dinner yeast rolls , they did not have the light crumb or high fat content of a brioche ( as advertised on the menu ) .
The former had too thin a sauce for the noodle type , and did not hold flavor .
I can not say i plan on coming back to found though .
The first 2 i ordered were not available .
Unclear if they were not in yet or if they had already run out .
Will never ever try again and will never ever go to this crappie place ever again
I am not a bbq expert , but my food was delicious .
I am not sure of the amount of shrimp i received , but it was plentiful .
Sauce was not warranted but i tried all of them .
I tried many other places in mississauga but could not find better one .
I the food seemed fresh , but two bites in , my mouth was scorched and could not taste anything .
Not even sure why they have stores .
You walk in and they can not help you with anything .
If you want to see century link home security they can not help .
If you have questions about new services coming they can not help .
It is not the fault of the store reps it s the company as a whole .
Not a whole ton of care put into it , but i have not seen them make any major mistakes .
First off , do not come here expecting high gastronomy .
If you accept this and that this is not a healthy lunch , you can be satisfied with the lunch at wilensky 's .
I had 2 special wilensky 's sandwich , one with swiss cheese and one with no cheese .
One warning though , do not expect it to taste like your commercial version of the drinks like coca - cola or pepsi .
I did not try the ice cream but it does look really good , i will go back to try that .
I got a single burger fries and no drink because they do not have a sugar / caffeine free option .
I can not handle caffeine late and i really do not need the sugar in the evening either so i had water .
It is not .
Do not waste your time or money on this place .
And new forms of comedy are not afraid of this platform either .
The prices are fair , the beer is cold , and even if you are not going to a show the lounge area is a place to come and relax .
Normally i do not finish fries but so hard to stop .
Thank you for making a much - dreaded experience one that we can look back on not with fear , but with pride that we made the right decision for our beloved little girl .
I did have to wait for an inpatient bed , but the wait was not long .
There was absolutely no privacy between the two beds , i could hear everything discussed about the patient as i am sure she could about me .
I got no sleep whatsoever , due to all the commotion and constant visits for labs .
I have never waited any longer than 15 minutes as it seems as if the nurses have gotten nicer .
I just do not like that when they put you in the chairs your so close to your " neighbor " ...
I m glad why i am here in personal i would not want the world to know ...
It 's not fun when the person next to you is here for personal reasons tho !
Roses lasted 3 days before they wilted and never opened up .
I never recall having to scold her .
Not your bill ... but the bill we had to pay with our heavy hearts over her loss .
You and rayana covered every base and never missed an opportunity to do the process properly .
You could not have done it any better .
How have i never noticed this place before ?
I 'd never had nem nuong before and i really enjoyed it .
First bill $ 50 credit did not happen .
They do not put anything in writing when they come to sign you up .
Do not reccomend .
Kind employee , wrong prices on drive - thru board , overpriced ( over $ 6 for their basic burger ) , super greasy meat , soggy bread , did not try the fries because they are shoe - string and i am not a fan of those in general .
No need to worry about emanating eau de burrito after ordering here !
I did not know a beef bowl with vegetables could be made so bad .
I just do not get how it 's so popular .
Will not be back , way better options all over the gta .
Dr. fixler did an exam and we discussed lucas ' symptoms and care and he told me right away that he did not think lucas was presenting like a dog at the end of his life .
I can not imagine a kinder , more lovely way for any of my animals to be treated - to be given an easier way onward , in surroundings they know and love .
Lady claims to cancel my order and not deliver it because she did not have chicken for 2 out of the ten items i ordered
Good service and delicious cornbread are not enough to recommend the successor to fisher 's .
The menu is extensive and maybe there are items which would have been better , but half of our group vowed never to return to try them .
Fragrant broth , good cut of meat , not too salty .
Now , you do not get a choice of sizes which might be a problem if you are big eater or get full too easily .
I could see why ppl think service is not as good as it can be , since it seems the sons who are primarily the waiters are just there to do their time for their parents .
At the end of the day , like most real authentic asian restaurants , it s about efficiency and not being that pesky diner .
If you have not tried this place , i highly recommend it .
They could not find our order .
I will not critique the show itself , which was pretty damn funny , if still very much a rehearsal , but i will say that the venue was great .
When you are about to have surgery , you get pretty anxious and just sitting there waiting does not really help , especially when you do not get called in until less than an hour before the surgery is to start .
If i had a choice , i do not think i 'd come back here again but would not mind it either .
Gave no explanation .
The server even crossed out the beer they did not have ..... i have to say the food was good tho !
The only thing which was slightly off was the bun , it was not strong enough for all the toppings and juiciness so got pretty soggy at the bottom .
There are not enough stars on yelp to reflect what i feel about dr. fixler 's service .
This is not a sob story about the most amazing family dog / cat / gecko / ferret to have graced this planet - god knows there are enough of those tributes to sort thru here .
( ollie is arguably the best protector and friend our family could have been blessed with , though .. on top of being the best dog * of all time *.. ) .. plus i do not need to choke myself up again ..
Not a pretty picture .
They never left ollie 's side .
Not factory made like some of the other burger joints .
The meats have no smokey bbq flavors whatsoever .
Second is the price ... i do not mind paying $ 22 for a full rack of ribs , but i was hoping for a big rack and / or large side portions .
One of my go to places for takeout for a quick dinner when i am not in the mood to cook !
You really can not beat the $ 4.99 price for a beef burger .
My stomach did not feel overly heavy after eating it .
The fries were not half bad either .
When i called and asked for fresh lavender , they said they would ask their distributor but could not guarantee this as it was not in season .
But being as it was coming from out of the country , they could not guarantee the quality .
Long story short , the fresh lavender quality was not top notch .
They still made the bouquet but did not charge us full price .
To be completely honest with you , i was not on hiatus from yelp all this time ( i know my reviews were starting to become missed about these parts ) .
After some deep soul and brain searching , i asked myself is there no better place to review other than arrowhead hospital ?!
Nope , i think this choice tops about everything ( that is that i have not already reviewed ) .
Yet , i hold no grudges for it , i just simply go get fixed up and put back out here in the world .
I think they have got it ok , but i only base this from outward appearances and have no non - er testimony of my own .
You are still alive and kicking , in moderately good health and not the most noticeable scars ... and you know what i say in response ?
Numerous ( no , not just one ! ) medical bills that were paid for by my insurance on time , but have their stamp of delinquency in my credit history .
There is another thing i would like to add to my list of things you do not mess with about me .
I am an adult now , and it s really important that i do not have things like that lingering about , please and thank you .
I used their services this evening and could not be more impressed with their care and handling of my dog .
But it is not my first option at all .
I might try it again but not in the near future .
I do not recommend it that much but it worth to try it ) .
If you can not have something specific on the burger , just ask them for without .
I like this place because it does not make a dent in my pocket .
The latke was hard and i could not taste the coleslaw .
Seating area is not big , but people clear out pretty quickly after their meal .
So finding a spot to eat should not be too difficult .
I though for sure these flowers are not going to look like as they do online .
It was not enough .
He was 16 and though i was not ready , it was time .
I know today 's arrangement for my assistant will not disappoint .
I wish i could give the dancing dandelion a 10 star rating because 5 stars does not cover the unbelievable experience we had with them .
The attention to detail was impeccable , not one thing was overlooked .
I sat at the bar for a hour and watched three waitresses literally do nothing but complain to each other while doing no work .
The food is awesome , open really late , big alcohol selection and the guys are cool , can not beat this place
Not a huge selection but enough to fit my needs on short notice .
Not sure why i have never been here before but i will be from now on !
We drove by this place over the weekend and i did not know what it was , so i came back in for lunch .
The fries were awesome - i do not normally like shoestring fries , but these were cooked perfectly .
I am not sure what exactly it is , but for a person like me who normally mixes ketchup with ranch dressing for her fries , this stuff was yummy .
The waffles at lo - lo 's usually have a slight cinnamon flavor and are crispy , but we all agreed that the waffles here were soggy and did not have a strong " waffle " flavor .
The syrup was not thick either and was really runny .
They were thinner than i remembered and did not have the seasoning on top , but i still enjoyed them .
Do not live here !!!
Repeat do not live here !!!
I lived here back in 2013 when i first moved to vegas and did not know any better .
When i lived here the managers ( who are still the same rude , unthoughtful , down right horrible people and specifically i am addressing sandy and desiree ) would make a million excuses for why things happened but never would fix the issue .
Leap 2 years forward and i have learned never ever to be associated with rebel place and my friend moves into the complex ( even tho i warned him how horrible the managers sandy especially and units are ) .
Upon moving in they did not have a storage unit ready for him ( which he had preordered in advance ) and the apartment was a complete mess .
I m not being dramatic like trash all over the apartment , floors were filthy , lightbulbs missing smelled horrible .
Took us two days to clean his room alone ( then we had to clean the common areas because the manager said it was not their responsibility to ensure the apartment was clean when you moved in .
Next , one of his 3 roommates was being evicted for not paying rent .
So my friend was locked out and had no clue why .
Sandy the manager said she could not do anything other than call pest control .
She did not offer any form of alternative relocation in the mean time and kind of dismissed the issue .
Further , sandy said " this is student housing were not held to the same laws " when i was addressing tenant rights .
Sandy is a liar they are not considered student housing and on top of it neither my friend nor his roommates were even students .
Topper ** so my friend and i go back to the office to speak with sandy about how he had mentioned how dirty the place was when he first moved in on his checklist ( which is also a liability form to address any prior issues to the apartment so that he 's not held liable when he moves out ) and guess what " they lost it . " liars !!
They did not want to be held liable for how filthy the place was . this is one of the worst places to live in , in las vegas .
I am not kidding , it looks nice on the outside but it 's filthy .
The jamaican jerk was not to my liking .
I felt it was not spicy or seasoned at all .
Dana suggested mayo with it , and i said no thanks , but do you have something else ?
I had to be honest , i just told her i did not like them at all .
When the owner found out that i was not satisfied he immediately came over to our table to talk with me .
I never got a bill so i had to asked dana for it .
To my surprise there was no billed because the owner took care of it .
He did not have to do it , but he did and for that courtesy i am so grateful .
If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you will be a happy camper .
No longer .
I do not want to go back !!
It 's not the greatest deal in the world .
But trust me the folks here understand that spicy does not necessarily have to be super hot .
The wonton soup was a disaster ... it was thick with mushy pieces of pastry with not one wonton to be found !
I 'd never go back to this restaurant nor would i recommend to anyone .
The menu items are similar but you will not find the exact same thing if you frequent visitor to the restaurant ( limited menu ) .
Seasoning on the food was not so great and the waffle was a little bit flat .
It would be nice to if they could do orders to be served on a plate versus being in a box , but i get it when you are at the airport as you never know when you have to pick up and run .
If your traveling through and did not get a chance to dine at the restaurant , swing by and judge for yourself if a returned trip is required .
For a lunch during the work day , i 'd probably stop by china tango again , but i would not go out of my way to dine here .
Oh , i am sorry ... i did not realize russian gulag catering was a category .
I can not say enough about the mystery meat since i am not sure what it was .
It was not chicken , and it definitely did not taste like chicken .
I love the blackened chicken pasta most of all , but have never had anything here that i did not love .
It 's not too greasy , too salty , and has the perfect amount of flavor .. and i do not feel like sh*t after .
It 's not too greasy , too salty , and has the perfect amount of flavor .. and i do not feel like sh*t after .
I mo , the hot hot fish curry ( if you do not mind burning your mouth ) is awesome !
Not sure why , my husband would not let me ask .
Not good business .
This place will not last with the current menu and service .
Plenty of people working , the place is not big so no excuse
While the waitress we had was great , the restaurant itself was not up to expectations .
While we have eaten at other restaurants in this chain before and will likely stop at one in the future , we will not go back to this one again .
Sure there is not " lo mein " on the menu , but if you actually know your chinese food like i do , you will realize that this is not a cantonese style restaurant -- where lo mein is usually served .
If you are not familiar with hunan or szechuan style food , you will not understand sesame inn.
I had no questions or misgivings about his intent and felt he made an honest deal .
The shuttle leaves exactly on time based on shuttle schedule so be sure not to be a minute late - you will miss it .
Both of which do not do any patrolling whatsoever .
Are we at navy pier ( tourist trap with overpriced food for those who do not know ) .
Do not get me started on the pathetic pulled pork slider ( $ 8 ) .
If it was not , then it must have been toasted & sat around for two hours .
The egg was actually the best part of this dish , but let 's be real here , a deviled egg is nothing special - not anymore than any other deviled egg i have ever had .
Not a knock on their food which is still great .
This had not been my first time at texas roadhouse , but it had been my first time in my adult life .
I honestly do not remember them being this good when i was younger .
When i called the owner all she said was we are busy and that 's how we do it and if i did not like i should not come back ... i will not be back .
I was not all that surprised how my food turned out .
I really recommend other spots to have a sandwich , but this place did not disappoint because my expectations were not all that high to begin with .
Not much to talk about as i said , there 's really nothing special about eating at this place .
Wifey loves it and does not share ! :(
While the broth still flavourful , the sausage did not taste fresh at all .
Everything else is ok , they do not skimp on the portion and tables are still being turned efficiently .
The did not know me at all , i only moved here to phoenix in february .
They not only let me drive off with my new sporty red mazda 3 the next day , they did it without seeing my trade - in and they are patiently waiting for me to get my trade - in turned in to them .
I am sorry , there 's just no nice way of saying it .
Do not recommend for those who love a good chinese spot .
If i could give no stars , i would .
When i showed up to move in , the floors were not done .
Maintenance does not respond to issues with the apartment ...
Do not rent here .
Have moved out of the area but can not find another pho that compares .
My disclaimer is that i never had great expectations prior to going in and you should not either .
I will not say the food is mind blowing in any way but it does the job .
As if that 's not enough of an incentive , they offer all guests a free dessert at the end of your meal .
The desserts they serve are not the rejects either ( unlike most places where they serve those red bean / green bean porridge crap that noone touches ) .
No complaints .
To be honest , just not the same .
Unfortunately we were not very happy with how our food tasted .
I do not think i will return again .
The dough had a great buttery taste from the ghee ; i do not even want to know how many calories were in this thing .
The accompanying condiments were all good ( i was not a huge fan of the coconut sambal ) but otherwise these were great to dip our crispy dosa in .
The butter chicken was a pleasant surprise too considering that it is not a south indian dish .
The chicken was served in boneless chunks which were quite large , the gravy was very creamy and not very spicy , this dish was very enjoyable .
Our young waiter seemed intimidated by our group of 7 people ; it was clear that most of our table was not familiar with the menu items but he did not offer any explanations or provide us with any suggestions .
If you have not been before , sierra gold is a upscale version of the pt's you find everywhere else in the valley .
Two stars simply because they eventually brought our food that was not good , after spilling soup across our table .
The soup tasted very salty and was not good .
My salad was not good .
Close to unlv , the airport , and the strip so no complaints about the location .
I did not have much interaction with the office staff but they were friendly and helpful when i did .
Did not have the vents cleaned or anything , just called it a day .
Still have no idea what that was but it was disgusting .
Overall , i would not highly recommend rebel place or tell anyone to stay away .
I was especially interested in the ones that said the sesame chicken was not good since ashley l. said that was her favorite .
This is not my normal favorite as i do not like tofu and it is usually unpleasant if i get a bite .
It is mostly the texture i do not like but the tofu was smooth and tasted like the broth and so i ate the whole bowl .
I was not expecting this much food .
I can see why some people were put off by the sesame chicken as it is not prepared the way it is everywhere else .
Is not a fan of chicken but loves this chicken and i can see why .
It was perfectly prepared with no fat globs anywhere .
I do not like fried wontons usually because they make the mouth feel like is has been greased yuck .
These did not have that horrible side effect .
The egg roll was perfectly crisp without any of the guminess that can occur if not cooked properly .
I do not know who our waiter was exactly because it felt like everyone was waiting on us .
It was not terribly busy but there was great teamwork .
Our tea never ran out no matter how fast we drank it they always filled it before we could finish it .
We never felt rushed to leave and even after the check was on the table we were checked on frequently .
I can not wait to become a regular here .
Pls do your self a favor and do not choose to go here .
The funny thing is it was not even enough for one person .
I asked the waitress why it is so much for just one mutton kothu rotti , she did not have an answer for me .
I would never go back to karaikudi .
I was disappointed with the blue cheese , it was very runny and thin with no chunks of blue cheese to be found .
If you are in love with pf changs ( which i do like ) or some other new fangled version of chinese food - do not come here .
If you are under 30 , you may not like this place because you want hip and excitement and do not even know what chinese food from 25 years ago is like or should be .
This is a nice family owned restaurant and i have never had any rude experiences .
The staff here can not comprehend english .
The last time i came here , we did not make reservations so we had to go up to the lounge area ( still pretty awesome ) .
I love chips that are not just your regular potatoes .
Seriously , a much larger portion than you would expect , pictures do not do it justice .
The only personal thing i would say is to not order the picada if you can not handle it .
This is not your typical dimmed lighting dining space , this is a well lit and fun dinner space .
My experience was not bad but i was supposed to be getting two $ 100 referral check for the two people i sent .
Never got my first check but that was a few years ago .
I call every other week to check up on it and i am always getting another excuses why i have not received my check .
Here is just a few of them : manager had a heart attach , check printing machine is broke , lost in the mail , have not had time , check writing department is closed for the day , and more .
I am sick of it and will never be back .
Pricey for what you are getting , and though it 's carefree / n.scottsdale area , it just does not quite justify it .
Food is not bad , but not great either .
You will not regret it .
This was an above average restaurant experience , but not great .
Did not even bother to look at the online orders ...
No longer as good as they were .
Honestly i regret this decision because the food was mediocre and not worth the price .
I would not come back again , this place is only nice for pictures .
Had we not had out of town guests we would have left the whole order .
How can they not add correctly as we were on hold for 5 minutes waiting for the total .
Never order from here again .
I 'd go back here to have a drink or shoot pool , but never to eat .
So i have not ever given anything a bad review in my life but for you , rebel place , i will make an exception .
The atmosphere is very exciting , this is not a quiet place .
We got to our table and the waitress was there in no time telling us about the specials and took our drink order .
We love mexican and latin food , and this place did not disappoint .
My boyfriend , myself and a friend went , we all had the onion blossom , pretty good , the fried pickles we are better then expected and of course a few beers and stawberry banana margarita , can not go wrong with any of those .
Everything seemed to taste fine , so i can not rule out any one part of the meal that caused it .
Not for sure .
So as far as my review goes , the food tasted fantastic , but i have never felt worse after eating .
But the last few years has led to uneven dishes , and sauces that have no subtlety or are just plain greasy with little flavor .
Last but not least , the sweet potato pie and pear cobbler served with a cute little milk bottle full of cream .
Can not think of a thing that could have been improved upon .
I come here at least twice a week , not even lying .
The decor is not exactly fancy shmancy , but the food makes up for it .
I am not a huge fan of the korean food , but mainly the chinese dishes are spot on .
I really do not know what else to say about this place , but ...
If you have not been here , you got ta go !
This place is not for those with a fear of loud noises and crowds .
Now for some notable highlights / lowlights : very limited beer selection - first , there 's no shiner bock or texas beer of any kind and the rest of the beer offering reads like a frat house mini fridge .
Chilled mugs are for floats not beer .
Not a bad deal considering i got dinner for the next day out of it , too .
Alternatives for those into swine - if steak is not your thing you can get ribs , chicken and even fried catfish .
Not covered in sauce the meat was tender and juicy with just a hint of smoke .
It 's loud and it 's country - i personally can not stand country music of any kind so i had to go to my happy place while i was here .
It 's blasting out of every crevice of the restaurant and there 's no escaping it .
Not normally a fan of chains , texas roadhouse is a solid , middle - of - the - road steakhouse with good service , good steaks , and killer rolls .
If you are part of the " i love this bar " crowd you will feel like you just came home and if you are not you can grin and bear it for a well - cooked piece of meat and a damn good baked potato .
It 's old school , not like " fusion " places that are rampant as all get out .
Sesame inn does not use celery , as far as i know .
As i tried to get it , i had no idea this sandwich shop was actually inside red rock casino .
I have not had an italian sub this good since i lived in eastern pa. the meats were good quality and the bread was amazing !!
Not busy on my visit , and yet my simple food order takes a very long time ( remember , this is an airport location with a limited menu and no seating ) .
When we arrived on friday night we did not have a reservation and we were 6 people .
When i go out it 's usually with clients so i do not have too many opportunities to visit in spots .
I genuinely liked almost everything here , but when i tried to return a dish ( dessert ) which did not reach min standard ( not sweet at all which by basic purpose has failed ) they refused to do that , which i really felt unhappy about .
It looked 100 % better and no hassle at the rental car agency .
This shop does not specialize in auto body work , but they kicked ass for me .
I am not sure .
Our entrees were not much better .
No , no .
Apparently there is a usual wait , however the employee never gave notice of that .
I understand things happen , but why not try to correct the problem and try to rush an order , to try and turn the customer experience around ?
I drove 45 minutes , and was told the last call was passed , so they can not seat me .
Do not even try wasting your time !
We had virtually no wait !
I asked one of the guys how much i owed them and he told me that since they did not find anything wrong with my car , it was on the house .
I asked if i could pay something , but they would not accept anything from me .
This place has great food - i heard about lolo 's at the airport but i was never able to go due to the normally tight connections - well today i had time and lolo 's is in terminal 4 just before security so i popped out and had a great meal - the chicken was hot and crisp - i am not a waffle fan but it was good too - i definitely went for the chicken and was not disappointed - i had to wait a little bit but fresh , hot fried chicken was worth it
Arrived on a packed friday night , no meat for lent my booty !
What i love about julep is that you do not feel rushed .
Terrible & rude customer service will not go again ; happened on oct 25 2017 10 - 11 am .
Then i paid with cash , and then she said , " do not play around kid " .
I did not care because i can not legally use it in canada and it is inconvenient .
Not only do they have a cocktail lounge on the second floor with trendy wall art , the entire main level of this restaurant makes you feel like you are somewhere down south .
Plenty for two people but so tasty that you could not not finish the entire dish .
My recent visit was the top that has convince me i am not going back to this restaurant .
I did expect it to be slow ( as usual ) but not rude .
Anyhow , not long after we sat down , someone else ( known to the staff ) came in ( a party of 2 ) and sat where i had requested to sit .
2nd strike - generally you get kimchi & soya beans as starters but this time we did not so i asked for it .
The first person said they will bring it but never arrived .
We do not have any & it 's too busy .
The food which is really why i am tolerant , did finally came but it was not good .
Everything was under seasoned & had no taste .
Would come here for food but not for anything else in the future till it 's run a little bit better .
Never too busy .
Food service took forever to arrive , was cold , and not up to par for a slop house .
They did adjust my bill which is to their credit however i will never go back there again .
Finally made it on my most recent visit to phoenix and i was not disappointed .
It 's extremely popular now but that has not spoiled the upbeat and organized service , and , most importantly , the great food .
The food here is ok but the service here is horrible i would not return .
The one waiter we had was great but the manager clearly does not care about retaining a customer base or anything even close to such intentions .
They did not have any vegetarian soups , which is fine , except when i asked for just hot water in my pot , they said they had to charge me 2.50 for it .
I was completely ready to pay the 23.99 + tax for hot water and vegetables , but half of their items on their menu were also not available .
I will definitely not be returning and will be advising others to go elsewhere .
That 's just so ghetto , ai not it ?
Now here 's a case where what you do in phoenix may not stay in phoenix since who knows what would come out of you after the " fasten seat belts " light comes on .
What may have not been a great sign is that i had to cajole the server to come out of the kitchen to take my order .
Do not judge me .
I was hungry because they did not serve lunch at my business meeting .
Not pretty .
Service - 2 stars ... i did not get a lot of phoenix love here total - 2 stars ... southern by southwest ?... hmmm , not really

Do not rent from rebel place !!!
I was here for not even 2 weeks and within the first week my boyfriend and i found these huge bites on our back that were itchy .
Also , because we did not notify rebel place that we had an infestation within 48 hours of " moving in " ( even though i had not been living there for a few weeks after " moving in " ) , it was not their responsibility .
We were not even allowed to contact global pest control to ask about the report or how much the treatment would cost and turns the inspector they used was totally working with rebel place .
The report said that there was bed bug feces , yet no bed bugs found , therefore rebel place is not responsible .
He basically said in his report that he found evidence and then later stated there was no evidence of bed bugs .
The whole time mandi refused to do anything because " there was no evidence " .
- the security guard is a joke , they do not even kick out the homeless people .
There even was a wrecked car that sat in the back of the lot , and tons of cars are parked in the visitor spots that have not been moved in weeks .
- fro nt desk never answers the phones even during their " business hours " .
- upon move in , apartment was filthy and obviously had not been cleaned .
They claimed to do an inspection to ensure all appliances and sinks were working properly but blatantly did not .
Kitchen sink was leaked not only on top of the counter but also under the cabinet causing the wood to have severe water damage and pools of water .
Washer was broken and shower did not work .
- when moving in brandon in the front desk did not explain how anything works and not even which keys belong to which doors in the apartment .
I never found out what mailbox number i was .
I attempted to let guests in numerous times and never once did this method work .
I talked to the office countless times and was ensured the problem was being fixed a.s.a.p. ( guess what , it was never fixed . ) whatever you do , avoid rebel place at all costs !!!!!!
Folks are usually rushing in airports , but not here , and definetly not catering to the " flying public " .
I chose this area because it is close to unlv , however , the benefit of being close to the school is not worth the trouble of having to deal with all the difficulties that come with staying at this place .
Second , the management was not accommodating at all to their tenants ' needs .
Save yourself of headache , do not stay here !!!
I dropped off the truck with an electrical problem with the blinkers that they could not solve in a day and a half .
They really just did not have enough time .
They told me what they had discovered so far and did not charge me .
I fix alot on my own vehicles but will take them here when i do not have a lot of time .
Also they do not take credit card , make sure you bring enough cash or have enough funds in your debit .
Just do not expect to be impressed by the food anymore like in years past .
No big deal right ?
Oh but wait , when i asked the waitress lisa she insisted that hey never make it with breaded chicken and walked away .
As i was on my lunch so i did not have a lot of time , so i thought to myself i 'd just order a small side of chicken tenders ...... but when i " inconvenienced " this waitress by asking for a small order she said that the smallest she could do was the lunch portion , which i did not want to pay another 10 for .

Very disappointed with this place and would not recommend others coming here .
Eventhough my husband does not want to eat !
I do not recommend this !
Will never come back here
2.5 stars i got the malay chicken curry - comes with potato salad , bun ( good ) , vegetable soup ( good ) , milk tea ( ok ) - curry was spicy but no hint of malay flavor or coconut ... - chicken was tender but personally i do not like previously deep - fried chicken ... - rice was super hard and dry price is about $ 1 more than other hk style in the area ..
I can not in good faith endorse this place .
Although the place did not look particularly clean in that dirty dishes were not cleared , and service not friendly , we were still going to return until we got the bill .
No itemization , no tax , and it was wrong .
We questioned but got no satisfactory answer so we did not feel liking fighting so we just paid what they asked and decided never to go back .
We will never never return to this restaurant .
I am not going to speak of the expensive prices as i am okay with paying for quality .
This was not quality food .
We were not compensated for the ceviches , however we did incur additional charges of $ 4 per person for cutting our cake .
I am completely disappointed and can not believe the lack of professionalism at an establishment that i have heard so much about .
Our group of friends and family will not be returning to this " restaurant " nor will i be recommending it .
The 1 star was given because there was no 0 star option .
Not sure if they are always like that or if they were undercooked .
My steak was just okay not the quality that i was expecting and my baked potato a little on the not done side .
When the bill came we were charged for both entrees and no adjustments were made .
Not the experience that i have had in other texas roadhouses .
If you are reading the other great reviews for lo - lo 's and hope to catch a taste in the airport ... please do not let this small kiosk style location taint your experience .
This smaller lo - lo's is definitely not on the same level as the location we visited in scottsdale .
For example breakfast and desserts were showing on the menu board but are no longer available ( ... and my wife was tuned up for her some red velvet cake too ! ) .
I do not know what they were talking about , per se , because i was too far for my nosey ears to hear .
The vegetables were cooked nicely but i was not a fan of the sweet and salty flavors .
My taste buds were like , no por favor , dude .
And that 's something i do not get about fast chinese food and probably never will .
Had they lightened on the sauce ; added more onions and cabbage ; and not cooked them for too long , i would have eaten more of it .
Should not fried rice and chow mein be charged extra because you are using extra man power and other ingredients ?
I did not sample the latter but it was a sweet gesture .
If china tango bistro wants to strive for a modern and chic like their décor , they must have food and service to match that , and china tango bistro sadly does not .
And that wait was when they were not busy at all .
I do not think that pre-cooking and holding chicken and waffles would be an appetizing purchase so to do it right you have to wait - assuming you can .
I can not begin to explain my frustrations .
I bpught a car from these guys 3 weeks ago and currently they have had it more then me with all the problems i cpuld deal with that part , but i am currwntly waiting for the manager jason graves to call back about it gping in again for the third time for the same thing , still not fixed .
These guys have had me buy their loaner cars , 3 tanks of gas , one was so bad it did nt have enough gas for me to get to the gas station to fill ot for them they tried to have me take it through emissions when they realized they had nt yet , the original problems are all still going on , they haf me make a list , fixed nothing , took advantage of my wife not knowing , and told her they were nt fixing a headlight that was broken when i bought it .
I have to say that my first experience with capriottis was not a good one .
Not necessarily a bad one either but it did not make me want to come back again .
My first visit was just not impressive .
I was spoiled and ruined for any other philly i ate there after lol anyways although it was not even comparable to the philly my bf 's grandpa made it was still quite good :)
There are not many deliver options close to my house in summerlin but china tango is across the street and a great choice for the hot nights that you just can not bare to cook !
Let me tell you we used to love lamb briyani from karaikudi , but seriously what we have received today it 's not even close to briyani simply yellow rice with some lamb pieces !!!
Not gone order anymore !!!!
We arrived at 8 pm and did not get seated until 9:15 pm even though most of tables who arrived after us were already seated .
As i mentioned before , we were not very happy with the service here - we had to ask for water 3 times before it came , our soups were only refilled once and that was towards the end of our meal , and no one really came to check up on us throughout the meal .
I am not even sure what we ended up ordering because they just brought out a whole bunch of stuff .
One good thing about this place is that they do not charge you extra for the good stuff ( aka seafood ) .
All in all , morals is a good place to eat if you are a fan of hotpot and do not mind a wait / subpar service .
Do not expect anything too fancy it is a traditional hk cafe style located in an old plaza that has seen multiple restaurants that has gone through there .
Overall impression is not bad .
The vegetable soup had real ingredients ( lots of veggies ) , the tomato sauce has real tomato not a suace made of ketchup so it actually taste proper .
It 's not too bad here for the price that it is !!
Not too shabby !
Can get rather pricey though if you are not drinking the drinks that are on special .
The setup is not what you would normally expect with what comes with a southern diner ( this is not a diner but a hip yet homely atmosphere ) .
I am not lying when i say that i have never had a dish i did not like here .
The food is never greasy , never oversauced and never overcooked .
I seriously have no complaints at all .
Little or no msg in my opinion since i do not get thirsty after drink the beef broth .
Do not expect much !
Not an ideal environment to spend time at !
If it is not , it 's certainly in the running .
I could not hear the person sitting next to me .
This is an ok chinese restaurant , not the best nor the worst .
Food is okay , but really not special or made specially well .
I ve had breakfast , lunch and dinner here before and it 's like they do not put much care into the way dishes .
Would not recommend this place and would not really want to return .
Nice for those evenings when you just do not feel like cooking .
If you have not had the pork chops you do not know what your missing
Half of the size as if somebody already ate half of it ... not sure what happened ....
Sister of ming kee in scarborough but methinks not .... tried this place yesterday with famiy and i was extremely disappointed .... in service , price , quality and everything else ...
So , i ordered the porkchop rice with tomato sauce and cheese , which is something safe and slightly easier to do .. it clearly said cheese with tomato sauce and porkchop on it ... when it arrived ... there was no cheese .. whatsoever .... so i asked and they said ... " oh , if you order the tomato sauce there is no cheese because we feel cheese does not go right with our tomato sauce " so why did you put cheese in the menu ... that s called deceiving customers ...!!!

Family member ordered steak with spaghetti , it was tasteless ... and black pepper sauce only had the colour ... no black pepper sauce taste in it whatsoever ... the pricing is more expensive than some of the popular places in the area like phoenix and congee queen ... i am 100 % sure you will get better food there ....
After going home , i felt sick and the food felt like it was not digesting .. even until the next morning .... i have no idea what they put in the food but i am never going back ...

This place is not very good at all .
Please save yourself some money and do not eat there .
We could not even finish our food because it s so nasty .
Why am i get served and ends up not listening to my customer service where i am not going to eat this place where i am not going back there again .
I end up there with various groups on occasion , but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years ( more frequently in my first years in madison , less so now ) .
It 's not that there are vastly superior authentic chinese options ( although i prefer p. f. chang 's , recognizing its limitations ) , but one does better with other asian options when in madison -- particularly thai / laotian , but also indian ( with many new options in recent years ) .
Glad i was not on that level .
We come back not because the food is good but because of the staff .
We sat in our favorite seat and the place was not too busy .
She would not look at us she kept telling us to wait before we could have her take our order ( 20 minutes we waited to place an order ) .
She obviously does not enjoy her job and made it more than clear we were not a priority to her .
When we finished our meal we were discussing if we would get dessert when she shoved the bill holder in my arm and stated , " you were not getting dessert were you ? " as she walked away without waiting for our response .
We should have never left her a tip but we left her less than 10 % .
She is so bad for your business and you should really think about giving her less hours to be near customers or maybe she should work in the back where she has no contact with people !
She will not stop us from coming in because we love it there but we will make sure we never come in when she 's the server .
I told them i had a time limit because i had to go to work and she did not care .
When they changed the locks both our keys did not work so we went to the office and they were on lunch like they always are .
After they saw we were not leaving they finally came over and we told them we were locked out with groceries and finally after 15 minutes they got maintenance over .
They never did so i called friday and the worker said :
Guess what they did not come and maintenance is only monday through friday .
So i called and talked to them on saturday and they said maintenance could not come because it was not an emergency .
Thanks rebel place i had no dishes and my house stunk for a good couple days .
She has no consideration for others .
I would love to put her in my smelly apartment for a day because she does not care that are garbage disposal is broken .
I have never wished someone would lose their job before but she is seriously an awful person .
She told me i did not pay my rent 22 days after it was due .
Do you really think i am that stupid i would not pay my rent for 22 days ?
She talked me to me like i was stupid and worthless and did not believe me when i said i had already paid it .
I hope nobody ever considers moving in here and eric do not comment on post i do not want to hear it you have awful employees and nothing you say will change my mind i only put a portion of my issues on this place on this review .
One of the bread items was suppose to come with condensed milk , and she did not bother notifying us until she served the dish .
Will never go again or recommend .
We did not have any drinks but hope to sample a few next time as we will definitely be back .
He did not know what to say when we asked .
Second the bartender did not know how to make a whiskey sour and he was over changing us !
Bartender in the speakeasy part ( escobar ) refused to serve drinks to people who would not start a tab ( " i do not want to keep having to process one by one " ) .
And was not keen on providing water to dd drivers ( i guess for lack of tip ) .
They give you half the food , no noodle things , and still charge the same amount .
The tea tasted bad - i guess on the account they do not have filtered water .
Will probably not be caught in there again -- too high of prices for small portions and old food .
We reserved a booth well in advance but we were short one person so they said they could not seat us there and ended up giving us a table near the front of the restaurant .
The prices are cheap here and food is ok , not great , but you really can not expect much for the price you pay .
Er , no i have not been back since .
Not any value for your money ... run away from the place if you think it s vegetarian friendly !!
The vegetarian items are so over priced with meagre quantities ... i spent almost 14 $ on entrees which had spartan snacky amounts ... would not come back here ... sorryy !!
The car is still under warranty so it did not cost anything but there are two things that make me appreciate the service .
My wife has a honda which had a small leak that we were aware of and we took it to san tan honda for regular maintenance and they could never find any leak .
The mechanic who did the work and reported the leak to nick should also be thanked but i did not get his name .
I got one waffle , two small chicken wings , and a side of greens for 15 $..... that 's a lot of money for such a small amount of food with no drink
We both got the pasta salad side which was very good - lots of veggies and lightly dressed so it 's not your typical pasta salad ( at least from a jersey perspective ) .
I liked this place a lot and wish we did not have to rush to the airport to return home - i would have happily stayed for another round of drinks and maybe even dessert .
We would not have known about it otherwise .
Never wanting to spend that much for my car it went untreated for years .
Tj took the time to listen to what i thought was wrong and also explained that they provided a free diagnostic without having to agree to repairs if i did not want any .
A very nice no pressure approach that was very refreshing .
Service is pretty standard , we had no problems and our food came reasonably fast .
Granite counters and nice size stove for the inner baker i am ! ( except i live with 3 nasty roommates so it s not really rebel place for that , now is it ) cons : there have been quite a few times i have woken up at 3 am to someone blasting kid cudi threw there window which echos if you have a room with a window in the small quad area .
It s not rebel place for this .. it s the people who bring the wrong crowd here but we have had the police here about 4 times since i lived here each time someone who did not live here got arrested .
It s not rebel place for this .. it s the people who bring the wrong crowd here but we have had the police here about 4 times since i lived here each time someone who did not live here got arrested .
If im not mistaken one of them even dislikes me cause i am black and she is used to be the token black girl or something ....
People often get stupid in leave trash bags in the elevator which is not only disgusting it s unsanitary .
Overall i would nt be outside with a sign saying omfg you got ta live here but honestly if you want that dorm experience , party life , social life , or anything where not just some boring homebody ... this would be a great place for you !
Do not forget to order a biscuit !
I come here a lot because it s close to home and they have a few good wing flavors , but everytime there is a problem , shorted us a bucket of wings , gave us the rest of the order wrong , they do not make orders you call in and pick up , apparently they forget they took them , i will continue to go here and never leave a penny for a tip
I can not really rate it poorly , aside from the extremely non-tradition preparation .
I love lolo's ; however the food at this airport location was not representative of the lolo 's brand - not by a long shot .
Not happy with my $ 20 investment .
They have great specials and although you are able to smoke there , it 's not a smokey place at all .
Every place i have been this weekend has given me a nice birthday surprise , and sierra gold was no different .
The menu is somewhat assorted asian and offers many chinese favorites , some not so common chinese , some thai and a few other asian dishes .
They were in a tasty not too spicy gingery , garlicky sauce .
This dish had some heat but was not as spicy as szechuan .
I would not recommend this place .
I was a little concerned about having to pay a full month 's rent when he did not actually move in until the last week in aug .
I also would prefer not to have to sign a full year 's lease , in case he needs to move out or if he decides to come home for the summer , we will still have to pay through july .
It would be helpful to know in advance that there is no tv provided in the units ( even though they are fully furnished this is one item that does not come with it ) .
The down side to this was we were not able to see his unit prior to signing our lease agreement , and they need to give the current tenant 24 hour notice that you will be moving in .
Now , i do need to note that our son 's 1 roommate was still living here but had gone home for the entire summer vacation , so he was not aware of this , and apparently 2 of the old roommates had moved out and left the place a mess .
The issue was that somehow the unit was not properly inspected after the move out and we came into a mess .
I am giving rp 4 stars only because of the problems we encountered during the initial move in , but feel confident that this will not be continuing now that desiree is there and making the appropriate changes .
Kitchen m is a huge unit and there 's never any wait time no matter when you come , though the restaurant itself is lively enough and has plenty of customers .
There is a button to push for service but it 's better to just wave the waitresses down portions are very standard and even a tad bit larger than congee queen , but i would say the quality does not match congee queen or golden pheonix up the street .
They do not go light on the alcohol which is nice knowing you get what you pay for .
Would totally recommend this place and can not wait to go back to it next !
The lo - los at the airport is not the same as the remote location .
The waffles were not the same and the chicken sort of tasted like chicken from a knock off version .
It had no seasoning and i was not happy with the meal at all .
We ordered a viet coffee on ice and it came in a take out cup .. which is quite small and not filled up .
Overall pretty standard pho place w no bells and whistles and just some good ole pho or bun !
This is not a place for good customer service , beautiful decor , nor is it a place to seek for smiling faces .
I have been going here for years and i never get tired of it .
They made multiple calls to california to make sure we would not have any trouble transferring the car to our daughter .
Have not checked out escobar yet , but i heard it 's more of a scene now .
My only criticism is that they do not call back or have a good reservation policy .
I think the vegtables are frozen , not fresh .
I would go back with co-workers if someone picks it for lunch , but i would not pick it .
Do not move here !!!
Luckily i was not home , but i found out later that management declined to file a report with the police .
I understand that the apartments are not in a good area , but maybe try to balance that by offering security that does more than check their phones .
There is no screening process with the tenants they allow to move in , nor is there any requirement to move in , i.e. you do not even need to be a student .
I have seen other reviews were management says they have signs up that ask tenants to clean up , but offer no grounds maintenance .
Before i moved in , i was told that i would be moving into an apartment with girls that had been living there for years with no issues .
Rebel place is after your money and do not care what happens to you after you move in .
It took two of us to get the nasty roommate out of the apartment ( who had been living there for a year ... no problem ?
There is no buyout option on the lease and they do not show you the actual apartment you will be moving into .
They lure you in with their " amenities " but the fact of the matter is that amenities do not compensate for the disgusting , repulsive nature of these apartments .
It has been extremely stressful dealing with the chaos and that 's not something anyone needs to deal with while trying to go to school .
I was ignored ... not for 10 , not 15 , hell not even 20 but for 30 freakin minutes .
And never even asked what i 'd like to order .
You can find the manager but finding the oldest lady there who happens to be the most clothed ( she 's the one not wearing the vest and shiny beaded belt but rather a buttoned down khaki shirt and slacks .
The service at apache joe 's is far more courteous .. not always consistently the same people but at least the girl bartenders notice you are there !!!
It 's one of the few restaurants in madison that 's not a burger joint that 's not " too spicy " for my mom .
On to the meal , there were six of us ( ironically dear mother did not make it ) .
This is not a chinese place with bold flavors .
They will strong arm you and will not negotiate for used vehicles !
All prices and fees are set and they will say that they have no power to negotiate and that they are making no money off this deal ... what a bunch of lies .
I am not paying 33 % more for fees - the bulk of which are their dealership fees that are non-negotiable .
If these are set , non-negotiable fees that are this substantial , then why was not that included in the original posted price ?
I do not appreciate false advertising .
The lunch specials were nicely priced , but i was not impressed with the serving portion .
However , there was not a bounty of vegetables in this garden , which left me a little disappointed .
If i were hungry and in this shopping center , i would not rule out stopping back in , but i think there are spots in down that do what they do a bit better .
He had his guys check it out but the problem is still there and was not there before .
No other complaints !
3.5 stars not quite up to a 4 star , but pretty close to it .
I ran into a bit of the language problem holly mentioned in her review but it was not a big problem .
Of course , my wife 's was gringa -- no spice to speak of in the asparagus chicken .
It 's only a mile from home so it 's no big deal .
When we are expected to pay the full price , i did not like the discounted service and food selection .
Large menu with not only lots of pho , but good choices of vermicelli dishes ( bun ) and rice dishes .
Not fancy , but hits the spot .
We will definitely never go anywhere else again !!
They do good work at kinkade 's and they are well priced , but it took almost 6 days to get my vehicle back and i had to keep calling asking for updates after absolutely no communication .
Sells lemons - scam artist - do not buy here !!!!
I feel compelled to blast their b.s. so no others get taken advantage of .
My sister went to morals village tonight with her frds , a total of 5 ppl and she waited 1 hr for a table , but that was not the issue .
When my sister asked why they could not get the table she said because the table offers 6 pots so she could not just leave that one pot space to waste .
Never go to this restaurant !!!!
Do not waste your time !!!
They are amazing -- i can not recommend them enough !
As a sports bar it is lacking , they do not seem to have a full selection of nfl games available .
I could not disagree .
Just because you live in the sticks does not mean you rate something a 5 for simply existing in your town .
Disappointed as it is in a nice location and we really do not have very good chinese places in the area but the search continues .
Do not get me wrong , the restaurant offered a wonderful selection of fresh and good quality food ... what made me give this place 2 stars was the service .
We left hungry and disappointed , definitely will not be coming back .
Come here for a cozy / nostalgic atmosphere with commendable comfort chinese food and you will not be disappointed .
As we seated ourselves i could not help but notice the sanitary state of the place .
We ordered 1 iced tea 1 pork pot sticker 1 pork , shrimp , egg , chive dumpling the food was not great but not bad .
If their milk tea sucks , then i will not be coming back .
I remember when they first opened it was a bit lacking and the choices were not as great .
After dinner we moved upstairs to the lounge which was ok but not amazing .
On the inside you would not know where you are .
Not my scene .
It 's not far from where i work and that 's a small problem .
I was not expecting much , i have to admit .
Our service was good - the place was busy on a saturday night - so maybe we did not get as much attention as we would have liked ( drink refills , etc ) .
They are located before the security check point near gate d , so you can enjoy a meal before your flight with friends or family ( who are not traveling ) .
It was not soggy though , so they must have addressed previous complaints .
And well cooked and not greasy .
Not worth making a special trip for but decent if in summerlin and they do deliver .
It certainly will not be our last .
Charming atmosphere , not too noisy .
They call helped us with a crap car we had and did not screw us with the prices they were completely honest about everything .
We had a huge 1,500 fix and we could not pay it all tj , the owner , worked out a payment plan .
I seriously have love for these guys and all they have done for us i will never go to a different machinic .
Below is a photo of the new " parking policy " - breaking it down , it means they can not have a visitor over after 6 . yes , 6 pm for a college student .
It was illegal , and most definitely a horrible business practices so friends , do not rent from this shady , scam of a company - please , for your sanity and your wallet , go somewhere else !
The salt and pepper wings have become half the size they once we are and no longer come smothered in chile 's and green onion .
Not to mention peanuts , a bread basket , three 3 oz medallions , rice , and two sides easily makes two meals out of one $ 20 entree .
They are always super busy so it can be hard to flag down your server ( not an issue the past time i was here ) .
I did not care for their chili and would encourage a different side .
Lastly it 's a popular birthday destination and the " yee haws " make me cringe , but hey , maybe that 's just because i am no fun .
If you are looking for a great steak and not looking to break the bank or dress up for a fancy establishment i think you will love this place .
Dustin kees is patient and understanding will explain everything with those two you can not go wrong .
I will never go anywhere else
I have eaten there many times and not been disappointed .
Why can not the airport vendors keep good standards and reasonable prices ???
Not the best place , everything is greasy and the service is terrible .
They also have chicken , beef , and lamb options for a dollar or two more if you can not , or do not want to , eat pork .
We ordered a few non-dumpling dishes , but did not find them particularly interesting .
Never came , i asked again , never came .
For kids who do not like what s popular , they do have deep fried wings and fries , and sandwiches .
You are getting your moneys worth , yet the food was not bad .. service was bad ..
We have waited one hour and no table for us and instead gave it to ppl at the back of the waitlist !
Retarded host named silver cause she does not know how to be a host !
I own a restaurant and this should not happen !!!
Never going to be back again , and if by anychance i did ... that s because im complaining to the manager !
The host did not even acknowledge us for a solid ten minutes , even though she saw us while she was watering tables for servers and doing various other things .
The restaurant was not busy on a monday night , about a dozen tables were seated when my party of three arrived .
Again , the place was not busy .
But i definitely will not be going there again , nor will i recommend it to anyone that does not want to pay a lot of money for pretentious food and terrible service .
The prime rib was so tough i could not cut through it .
I stuck my fork in it and i could not get my fork out .
I never received my mushrooms .
The food was delivered and no one ever came back to check and see if everything was ok .
I can not get enough of this place .
The hostess told us there was a wait but could not tell us how long " i do not know " !
Would not be returning !!
I regret i moved here from ca to goto unlv , i did not have any family or friends to show me the ropes .
Not to mention the walls are so thin you can hear other people poop and pee .
Signed , a current resident that can not wait to get the fuck out .
As other reviewers have said , they are in a hurry to get you to commit to a purchase , perhaps delivering a vehicle that is not quite ready to leave the lot .
It 's not an uncommon practice , but i have been to other dealers who strive to deliver a perfect product , where you end up leaving feeling like a customer , rather than another sales number .
Not a big deal , but an 80 mile round trip to the dealer is inconvenient .
I would not tell someone to avoid cardinaleway , but i have to believe there 's better mazda dealers in the valley .
Service is better at their chinatown location but i have never had great service at a hotpot restaurant .
On my last visit we were seated behind a very typical summerlin family with a teenage twit who felt it was her job to make sure everything was 5 star quality ( " what do you mean this chicken is not free range ?
Why do not you serve bling water ? " ) and never once did the waitress lose a beat or let the level of service for the rest of her full section drop .
Why do not you serve bling water ? " ) and never once did the waitress lose a beat or let the level of service for the rest of her full section drop .
I am not sure what it is - perhaps a combination of the smell and ingredients that are higher quality than most neighborhood eateries - but the food here is simply amazing .
They close at ten , but will not seat you at nine .
Wish i had been able to take all i did not eat , as i was so hungry i way over ordered .
Steak was cooked perfectly , and you 'd be amazed how many folks can not make a rare steak .
Go , just go , it 's great service from people happy to see you show up , not grumbling because you will make them stay late at work .
Seriously i ca n't deal with them anymore .
I am not even a resident here and i am still having issues with them .
They told me to call pinnacle ( former management when i was living there ) because they did not have those files with them and are with pinnacle 's management group .
When i called pinnacle they told be that they did not have it because the files are to remain on rebel place property by law for at least 7 years .
I can not tell but i wasted a lot of time calling back and forth telling them what the other said and i asked if they can contact each other to sort it out but they refuse to help me at all .
Do not put your money into / get yourself into their unorganized , dishonest , and horrible company .
Can not speak for the food , but the drinks were refreshing , strong , and delicious :)
Not only that - they are super nice !
Not very appetizing .
We were not that hungry so we got the chips and guacamole , a pitcher of sangria ( which by the way can easily be split between six people ) , and the empanadas .
I was not very hungry so i ordered a small italian sub .
There was a ton of meat and the bread was soft ( not like some other places which i will not name ) .
I still do not care for rebel place .
I typically do not eat steak , but it 's so good here that i get it every time .
So why not give it a try for myself ?
I came here on new years day and it was pretty busy , but there were seats available so i was glad there was no wait because the place itself is very small .
The workers did not seem to friendly because there were running around everywhere , plus it took about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us .
I have not seen hot and sour soup with seafood in any other place i have gone to .
Do not let the newly refurbished decor fool you .
We do not eat meat and are so happy with the tofu offerings .
The best dish was definitely the octopus - even one of my girlfriends who is not an octopus fan enjoyed it and said she would have it again .
It was pretty busy but we did not wait long .
And i am not complaining about the peanut shells .
Looks like the place has not been dusted for a year .
It is called out on their menu with a ' warning ' red pepper , but there was almost no spice in it at all .
I had called in advance to see if i could reserve a table ( knowing it would be busy on a friday but was told that they do not reserve for tables of 5 people and should just drop in .
It 's not a big deal but the girl on the phone was not very pleasant to talk to .
Finally , we had to just order soy sauce with no menu items to make sure we could get that sauce .
I use yelp all the time to find restaurants but have never posted before .
First off , entering the restaurant , the manager is at the counter on the phone , and does not even look up to acknowledge the guests as they enter .
Our server was typical for this type of establishment , so no issue there .
But 1 item was so off putting that the rest did not really matter , and here 's why .
It left a garbage taste lingering in our mouths that we could not get rid of ( imagine the smell of stinky tofu , but in your mouth ) .
The many other dumpling houses in scarborough / markham certainly do not taste like garbage or over fermentation .
It 's not supposed to taste or smell like garbage !
When the waitress came to our table to collect our money , she did not even bother saying anything to us about the 13.5 out of 14 pcs of dumplings left untouched at our table .
I do not care where i live in the valley , this is my spot .
This impressed me because in the many times i have had work done on my cars over the years , that 's never happened .
I do not mind sharing my spot .
I do not care how much stuff you put into a sandwich .
Waitress does not accept new customers at all when they are busy even there 's free table !!
The korean pork stew dish is quite good too , although would not be a dish you 'd eat in front of a date as it can be kind of messy .
Not exaggerating ... this was the worst chinese food i have had .
Maybe i should have reorganized the food in the bag tetris - style but i am not a huge takeout person so the thought never occurred to me .
Well , it did not .
The broccoli and carrots were fresh and crunchy but i did not pay $ 15 for broccoli and carrots !
They were already closing up , as in they were cleaning up and seemed reluctant to let us in , but they let us in anyways , they rushed us in ordering which some of us had no problem with because we knew our order but some of us did not and proceeded to get mad we did not order within 2 minutes .
We did not appreciate the service so me and my boyfriend paid and did not leave any tip , but the lady who cashed us out looked at the receipt and proceeded to say , " wow , no tip ? " .
Lol no thanks , we have not been back and found better places than this .
I recommend viet house , they are absolutely the sweetest servers , and we never got a complaint about our tips there .
Well i love capriottis but this was not the best experience i have had by far .
First off i do like the caps on sahara and my hubby asked if it was the same owner ... the girl told us no and we explained how we go there cuz it s close to work ... her response ?
" im sorry " and then went on to bash the owner of the other place ... i understand competition but that was just not professional .
I was actually going to give this place a better rating but then i found myself getting stabbed in the gums by a turkey bone from my bobbie ... i have a picture but unfortunately i do not know how to post it :(
I m by no means bashing this place but hope the staff will learn to have some class .
They do not let you share at this location and make sure you order enough for the amount of people there .
They were very rude and said that not enough for three people .
Never coming back here
They changed their breakfast potatoes ; they are now a little thicker , not so crispy , so i get the fries instead .
Update : children are no longer allowed at sierra gold because of the liquor laws .
Some may call it a " dingy hole in the wall " , but beyond the old furniture , the few utensils that have not been scrubbed hard enough , and the somewhat questionable washroom , it houses very delectable dumplings .
We came with a party of 7 and there were no difficulties with seating us .
Aside from chinese fare , this restaurant also serves korean dishes , but i do not believe these will be on par with dishes served in k-town .
I did not get the chance to ask what the broths were made from for the vegetable dumplings and only turned a blind eye towards them when i was previously on a vegetarian diet .
For those who are wondering , the meat is cooked through and i have never come across a batch that was under-cooked .
Funny enough , my favourite dumpling here is still the bok choy dumpling , even when compared to its meaty counterparts now that i am no longer vegetarian .
I do not particularly enjoy sweet and sour sauce , so i am sure you can guess which dish was my least favourite .
The servers speak a mixture of english and chinese ( mainly mandarin ) , so communication will not be too difficult , especially since customers have to write down their orders themselves .
However , the servers never checked up on us throughout our 2 hour meal .
This was not unexpected though because many smaller chinese establishments tend to leave clients to themselves until they ask for assistance .
You see , it does not look very good when i had to wave down a second server after the first completely ignored me ( after she made eye contact with me and walked past my table twice ) .
We are not asking for our servers to go over the top with emotional labour , but we do appreciate polite responsiveness .
I will definitely return , but i have my fingers crossed that that particular server will not be there next time .
Although the service here is almost non-existent , and the place is not really nice at all .
Dumpling village never disappoints me , and i am usually stuffed silly when i walk out of the restaurant .
Do not rent from here !!!!
Bbb did not even rate it !!!
Build your own salad is my favorite , i ve had it 2 - 3 times and it will not disappoint .
This is one of the best places for hotpot , i have been to many of them but it 's not the cheapest .
I never had anything like it before .
It 's similar to chosunok but different . can not quite place the taste but i am addicted it now .
As for the dumplings , they are fairly good . washroom is in the basement : not recommended . :(
Mostly i like their vegetable dishes ... not your usual korean resturant in the gta .
I can not even begin to express my love of this service team !
They are phenomenal and i know i am able to trust them 100 % , steve is who i work with normally and he is not only super helpful but pretty dang hilarious and always has great stories to tell !
My family does not eat like pigs ) .
Quantities are not always very big .
I brought my truck to them because it was leaking coolant and had never run quite right .
I could not be a happier customer ; i would not hesitate to bring your car or truck to kinkades .
The hostess told us there was a wait but could not tell us how long " i do not know " !
Would not be returning !!
I will never come back to this place .
Then our server complained their tip was not enough even though he did not really serve us .
This place definitely has no morals in my opinion .
It is not greasy , crispy on the outside yet the meat is not dry .
Seasoning is not salty .
Not too many latin restaurants in the city , but this is one of them that does it great .
The service was a bit sporadic and we never had our water refilled throughout the meal .
The bar looked like a great place to grab a drink but i may not return for dinner in the near future to let them work through the menu and service a bit more .
You can not teach some people to enjoy their jobs and let it show .
We only ever go for their lunch special - so that 's what this review is , i have not yet gone here for dinner .
The imperial chicken is really good ( not breaded like someone else said , but it 's great ) , the sweet and sour chicken is definitely a " miss , " the mu shoo pork is great , although a tad greasy , the fried spring rolls are fantastic , the egg rolls are okay .
We never walk away from lunch hungry .
Not only did they not pay off my trade in fully and are now saying it is my responsibility .
There are not enough words to explain how bad these people are .
Do not buy from them .
Not to mention if you get an option of santander consumer as a lender run the other way .
Worst customer support ever and most of them do not even speak english that you can understand .
The sesame inn does not have lo mein on the menu - wtf kind of chinese restaurant does not have lo mein ? - but the hostess ( i was ordering takeout ) recommended chow mein instead .
The noodles were spaghetti noodles , not chinese noodles .
The sesame chicken was nothing more than a fried , sliced chicken breast with some kind of watery soy sauce on the side to pour over the top , absolutely no chili paste or thick sticky sauce .
I can not believe i wasted $ 30 on this crap .
I do not understand why it is so freaking impossible to find good chinese food in the valley that 's not from a chain like pei wei .
Of course , i realized last night that if i thought the last six or so chinese places i have eaten at were terrible , maybe the problem is not them , maybe i just do not like chinese anymore !
No gloves !
Did i mention that she did not even wash her hands first ?
When i asked for some water , the lady had to ask someone else to do it , which i did not understand since after passing the task , she just continued to chit chat with her coworkers .
Apparently service , water and tea are not free since she said nothing is free .
I did not bother to leave a tip .
I told her i paid a " service fee " , there 's no need to tip .
Roommates who went to re-sign a lease were told a lower price never existed when we had e-mails offering the rate .
We literally just had a maintenance worker and part of the " management staff " walk into the apartment uninvited , walk half - way into the apartment not saying a word to us and talking to eachother , and then walk out .
It sucks that there is not a whole lot of options for students around the university .
But none of the photos on this car showed how a dog destroyed the back cargo area , and i was willing to give the dealer a chance but they were not interested in working with me to pick it up in this condition .
Mind you , i drove from peoria and i would not have if i saw this ahead of time .
Otherwise there 's not much benefit to going to a dealer and paying the markup .
Needless to say i never received a response nor will i ever set foot in that dealership again .
Conversely , despite the mouth - watering aromas that greeted us , we did not actually smell like cooking when we got home , so their ventilation must be really good .
I have been a regular at this restaurant for almost 2 years and it has never let me down .
The dumplings are steamed , the skin is not too thick and the lamb filling comes out perfectly juicy .
Dishes that i have had and was not a fan of include the kimchi fried rice , and beef roll in foil ( which was bland and a little greasy ) .
When at this established do not expect a high level of service , you will be seated given a menu to mark what you want and then your food is brought to you .
It is run by 2 - 3 chinese women who get pretty busy so do not expect them to ask how the food was or anything .
If you require napkins just go up and grab them from behind the counter they will not really mind .
The restaurant itself is not the cleanest and is located in a strip - mall off shepperd ave .
I hate smelling like teppanyaki so having this giant space really helps that smell not to be woven info every fabric i am wearing that day .
Second , i know that this is not exactly revolutionary but for a cha chahn tang (??? )
Breakfast sausages were delicious and not drowning in oil .
They only have it for breakfast time ( why not all the time ?! ) .
They have a lot of toppings , the congee is thick enough so you are full , but it is not like you are eating congealed slime .
Usually when you make congee with toppings , the congee had all the flavour but the toppings do not .
Yeah service is not amazing , but it does not bother me .
People complaining about the service have not experienced real chinese customer service .
We sat , however , and when we were not ready to order in the first two minutes were waiting for about 15 minutes until we grabbed a waiters attention to place our orders for drinks and starters .
The menu looked interesting and we found some things we were not expecting .
The prices however were not commensurate with the product .
Not great , not bad , but for $ 6 we expected something more .
The mole was nothing like mole 's i have had in mexico , and the creative license taken is not welcome .
In short , julep is not worth the money , particularly with cheaper tastier options within blocks .
My girlfriend is not usually a hot pot lover , but with the great vareity of selection of food and hotpot base this place offered , she is loving it .
I have had some authentic biryanis , this one did not even get close to tasty , was spicy , but rice itself was not even well made .
These are standards and should have been made very well but were not .. on bright side , they made amazing naan , and paratha , too bad could nt enjoy it with same caliber for other dishes i got .
Now i do not understand why ..
I can not wait to see what julep 's dinner menu will reveal .
Do not waste any time getting over to julep .
Not to mention competitive prices !
But you will not see me complaining , you do get 14 .
Will not blow you away but definitely worth ordering each visit .
I am not exaggerated .
I love it spacious and order buttons so you do not have to wave your hand or scream out loud . :)
Try their french toast with red bean from the afternoon set menu , it is my favorite not overly sweet .
Not better and worse .
It 's not life - alteringly good .
You will not tell your grandchildren about it , but if you want a reasonably good americanized chinese sit - down meal for a reasonable price in the middle of an upscale madison suburb , with an understanding of the limitations inherently provided by that context , you will probably enjoy this place .
It 's not the most authentic food ever , it 's not the best decor you will ever see , but it 's good and it 's consistent .
I have been unhappy with one of the five entrees i have tried here , and i would not order it again ( the fragrant pork was not spectacular ) , but by and large , given the contextual specifications above , this is really good .
The bad : 1 . the menu 's a little bit repetitive , and is not as big as it seems .
The food was ok but the service - was not good at all .
Thought we would not go there again .
Is it a korean restaurant , not really .
Is it a northern chinese restaurant , not really there are a lot of korean dishes in the menu like pork bone soup , cold wheat bucknoodle soup , kimchi and bean sprout as appetitizers .
To tell you the truth i am in the area for over 10 years i never notice it until i read the reviews on yelp !
The tables are not really packed together , so you still have a certain degree of privacy at least i can not tell what the table next to me were eating .
I do not want to share !
Hmmmmm not good !
There are not much taste , not spicy enough ?
We could not finish it and end up have to pack it all to go ... ( not even sure i will eat it , but can not just let it all go to waste ) the dumplings arrived last !
The skin is nice and thin , not chewy and thick !
But if they are not burning hot , you can just stuff the whole thing into your mouth and let the soup and favour just explosed in your mouth .
If you going out on a date , please do not come here .
But considering the portions , they are not bad !
They are not stingy on the meat , etc . and the broth is not full of oil / fat .
They are not stingy on the meat , etc . and the broth is not full of oil / fat .
I could not believe my eyes but i actually saw the other patron reach behind the bar and pour himself a drink because nobody was around .
Tavern , do not bother .
This is not the same restaurant .
Do not forget your wallet !
Wish i could afford to eat there regularly , but my budget just will not allow it .
If i am hungry and i am thinking , i am not going to make it back home to cook ( let 's be honest too lazy ) i will pull off the keele exit and head north .
Just a solid no non-sense bowl of pho .
You can not go wrong with the cinnamon butter that they start you off with .
Tonight was no different .
It 's a busy restaurant and it appeared that most of the servers appeared to be younger , so i will not fault them too much for that .
I was not let down .
You know what , i do not really enjoy cake .
Yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy and delicious we buy the 20 inch and it s good for 3 of us , the employee are nice and friendly , they make the food the way you want it , not the way they want it if you never go just order it s best .
I told him to go ahead and eat so his food would not get cold .
I told him i did not want it now we were leaving .
He charged me for food i did not get .
He never apologized or anything !
I will never ever go back !
I do not recommend this place at all .
Bad service usually would not make me hate a resto if their food is not stomach - curdling and i am still decently satisfied after my meal .
I mean , i have waited more than 45 min for restaurants that do not take reservations .. back when guu first opened , pretty sure it was a more than one hour wait .
Fine , it was our fault for not making a reservation on a friday night .
A ) not coming back here for the next year b ) not coming back here without a reservation ever
A few things that bring the rating down to 4 stars : the service is terrible and the atmosphere gives the impression that things are not so clean .
Such a bad first apartment experience , that i am not even going to justify them by calling them apartments .
The dumpster area is constantly being trashed by the current residents , so much so that management can not keep up the cleaning , and to make it worse every night it seems like there is someone rummaging through it ( for either food and stuff , or important things like bills and credit card statements ) .
There have been multiple instances of gun shots , attacks , and even murders across the street ( visible if you view a crime map ) , and to make matters worse they can not even keep it away from the residents .
But , the people in the office are really nice when they are not on the phone ( with a potential new guest ) , or chatting with each other about their day or future activities .
In addition to that the day before move out i tell them i want to be there for the walk through ( because who would not when my security deposit is in the hands of a company so incapable ) and they said on july 30th that they will do a walk through the next morning ( july 31st at 8 am ) .
After waking up early and being there five minutes early i get told that i am not going to be getting a walk through today , and the supposed time for walk throughs had already ended ( the manage said an email had been sent out to the residents but it must have been one of the blank ones they sent on accident instead of the real move out information ) i truly do not recommend this place for you , and especially not for your kids they will not be safe .
You will live here for just one year ( because you can not end their lease early ) , dislike every minute of it , and decide to move anywhere else ( just like 85 % of the current residents now ) .
This place is in bad management , a bad area , and is not getting any better any time soon .
If you read through their page the only " good reviews " are either management replying ( which should not be counted as a review they just wanted to increase their stars ) or it 's from people who have not even moved in yet !
The design and atmosphere is the best in the city , no contest .
I am not sure how it took this city so long to get it right , but ...
Since the first time . i went 2 years ago they are pimping the place which is nice but hope they do not over do the place .
We recently moved to town and , in spite of the fact that it 's our anniversary , do not have a babysitter yet .
My only complaint is how salty some of the food was ( which was not really a problem for me but would be for those with hypertension problems ) .
I do not know what kind of morals we need to enter this place , but if we are talking about good service i definitely did not receive it here .
If we are talking about customers ' consideration of other customers , i also did not receive it here .
I appreciate the open concept , but it definitely has no village feel .
They also work very slow , so do not expect quick efficient cleanup of tables and turnaround ; i took 90 minutes to finish my meal , and i was only a table of two .
One issue i found with the menu is they do not have an immediate english translation .
That there simply is not enough fat in the beef .
I will not bother much with this place unless i do not wan na venture into richmond hill for good hot pot .
They apparently did not to an inspection because i got the car with a car wash and oil change .
Never did they inspect the pathfinder .
I have called the dealership to get the extended warranty information and no call back .
The combo is not something i would order again simply because the sweet syrup does not taste good with fried chicken so for me , chicken or waffles , but not together .
It was a wed nite and we did not know it is a comedy club nite .
People flooded the place so our service was slow and my food did not arrive hot .
Every email sent has not been resolved .
I like this place : the servers remember my name and what i like , the prices are not too bad , and it 's open late .
The risotto they have as a side is a nice touch and is not too shabby .
Not all is perfect as they do not have much in the way of juice and randomly are closed sometimes .
The physical facilities are fine , and the people are nice , but it 's not a place to live if you want somewhere peaceful .
Would never get call backs on a part we needed for car .
Will not do business here again or refer others here .
Brand new car not even 3 years in .
None of it was particularly memorable , and in fact the peking duck skin was * not * crispy , but the presentation was spot on .
I do not think madison 's foodies would give this place four stars .
But i do not think i have ever been so let down by a restaurant .
They forgot several items , the sweet tea was not great , the " gravy " ...
I am not even sure what it is / was , and the chicken was just okay .
The sweet tea was good this time , the chicken was better this time but certainly not great , the gravy i will not be trying again ( pretty sure it 's from a can ) and the waffle was bland and hard ( either it had been sitting around or was over cooked ) my recommendation is to skip this place and go downtown .
Being a woman , it 's refreshing to go to a place that is not going to try and take advantage .
You can not go wrong with the steamed dumplings here .
The place is pretty big , so do not be afraid to bring a larger group .
Service is pretty good , though i do not think they speak much english ( mainly mandarin , can understand cantonese ) .
Food quality is below - average , ( not terrible , but just not up to the level of the typical pub grub ) .
The main thing we did not like this time is that it had a weird texture , as if the mixture was not blended properly before cooking .
The table smells and it was not a good place for us to have a nice dinner .
We did not eat the rice because of the pleasant smell .
We go to pho restaurant and they give what customer ask , but this location is not stoping me for giving them a bad feed back .
I think we will not be coming back to this location .
The bar / cash counter need some work looks disgusting u will not imagine u get your drinks there .
I could not agree more with all of the negative reviews .
Eating here is like playing an hour long game of ' every surface of this restaurant is hot lava '. the photo of the restaurant here on yelp is dated .. do not let yourself be catfished .
Honestly i know it 's friday night and it 's busy so we did not complain about the 1 hour wait time , however when we waited for one hour and you did not give us seat but to other people who came after us simply because we have 5 people and the table you have open is for 6 which you guys did not want to waste the extra space , therefore gave it away to the people who came after us 3 x and 3 x .
Never going back !!!!!
No flaming & tasted like shrimp with onion relish over it .
I asked them why this is & they laughed & made some excuse but never offered to replace the dish .
The ambiance is a 5 but do not be fooled .
Exceptionally fresh and not at all greasy .
Straight forward guys , do not try to nickel and dime you .
Probably not the fastest service shop around but they do great work , especially for the cost .
Also have a free shuttle to get you home or to work if you can not stick around .
When you first walk in there may not be anyone there to greet you , so it can take them several minutes to notice you are there .
It 's not enough to keep me away , however .
I had gone through the menu beforehand and still was not sure what to order when we got there .
I expect a lot of tang and burst of flavors on ceviche which were there however the hamachi did not have the fresh flavor one craves ( maybe cured too long ? ) on to the mains i went with a chaufa and dc 's ordered the miso cod with dashi broth .
I did not know what to expect from chaufa .
Miso cod hmm i did try this dish and was not impressed at all .
Dashi broth did not add much to this dish imo .
The presentation is nice for all dishes and is in line with the food that is offered in the the entertainment district ( with price to match i should add ) will i visit again not sure at this price point there are plenty of other options imo.
I have not had chinese food in a while and do not know why i would bother coming up this far north to get it .
We sometimes have friends with small kids , no issues .
At least not the service field .
But was disappointed he did not get to witness that .
Both times lol ( not funny tho ) an item we ordered never arrived at all , but was not billed so we did not bother mentioning when we paid .
But she never offered to check on the item for us ... hellloooooo geeez finally mentioned to a manager ( owner ? ) who was going to check , until the cashier said she would ... but then she never did .
But she never offered to check on the item for us ... hellloooooo geeez finally mentioned to a manager ( owner ? ) who was going to check , until the cashier said she would ... but then she never did .
This place was an absolute mistake ; got there around 7:15 and did not leave till 8:45 .
This is not because the food was soooo amazing that i had to stay , but rather that my kids had to wait 45 minutes for the wonton with instant noodles .
Yes folks , that 's right , i said " instant . " not so instant in my opinion .
We have all made instant noodles at some point in our lives ; never has it taken me even more than 20 minutes and that 's usually because i am adding beef balls , eggs , or spam .
The plate was enormous but the amount of food did not quite exactly fit the size of the plate as my kids managed to scarf down most of it before their noodles arrived .
Had to ask for water three times as my kids can not drink tea , but after three failed attempts , i did not bother .
I also noticed several individuals leave before they finished my meal which was an indication that the food was not very good .
When i was about to leave , i asked to pay with interac but they said it was not set up .
They should really take off that interac sign on the front door if they do not offer that form of payment .
Atmosphere is quiet and does not seem to get to busy .
Pissed .... waited for 1.5 hours and server did not arrange seats for us .
The server name silver has very bad attitude and has no manner .
Will never go if she is working there .
I will say that the burger was cooked perfectly and the tots were the hottest part of the meal , not counting the renuked cheese dip .
Not the worst place i have eaten , but not someplace i am going to go back to anytime soon .
Then i did a pick - up order and noticed they were not on yelp , so i added them .
The menu has been scaled back a bit and the prices have increased a bit , not really surprising with the new building and make - over , i will get to that in a minute .
Holy mother of god i was not expecting the burst of flavour that came from this dish !
The entertainment district does not think people with disabilities get out much .
I am a little sad that i can not see as much now because the counter wall is a bit higher and i am short !
I could not have been more disappointed .
We started with shrimp rangoon , which was okay , but were not stuffed very full .
We each had an entree , i can not even remember which ones because they were so unremarkable .
I have no idea how this restaurant wins best of anything awards on a regular basis .
Do not believe me ?
You do not have to , you can go see for yourself .
They give you a $ 25 electricity cap and yet somehow , one person not using the a / c and cooking once a week with no tv can magically go over that cap by $ 80 - their explanation : " electricity is expensive " .
I would not wish these people on my worst enemy and as such , i am pleading with those considering this place , for your own good and peace of mind , do not bother stay away !!!
Some of you may choose to ignore my warning , if you do i am so sorry i could not prevent you from making what will undoubtedly be one of the worse mistakes of your life .
The noodles were a u don - like noodle which was the first surprise of this dish as it is not the traditional noodle used in wonton noodle soup .
The second surprise of the evening with this dish was that the wontons did not have a shrimp filling !
I did not care too much for the layer - thick wrapper , but the filling itself was quite savory .
Appetizers were mediocre ... nothing to remember ... we had the app for two ... calamari was horrible btw i could go into so much detail but who is gon na read all that .... the following is my reason for writing ... my forewarning is not to trust in ordering the lobster dish .
Ginger sauce or garlic butter i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best .
So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering .
What arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with .
There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce .
I will never return .
I can not tolerate being misled by a server we ended up tipping and not making a fuss ... just another lesson learned .
The storm raged on , i did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you .. not a total loss i guess .
I got no sugar and had to follow up .
I have never had yuca chips this way so it was interesting to eat .
For us customers : they do not accept us debit card , us dollar , and any type of credit card !
Although we paid with credit card twice with no problem in last three weeks , this time they just did not accept it .
They did not even accept us dollars .
If you do not have enough cash with you and do not want to bother using the paid atm outside , do not go !
Can not complain for service .
The food was not great got the philly cheese steak .
I normally do a good job at cleaning my plate not on this one .
I have never , never , been to a place like this .
He told me some minor issues , but said if it were him he would not bother with them .
I asked how much , and he said no charge !
I think not .
She never once so much as acknowledged me .
The korean pork stew dish is quite good too , although would not be a dish you 'd eat in front of a date as it can be kind of messy .
The sangria tasted literally like orange juice and wine , there were no other fruits in it .
Delicious sandwiches - can not wait to go back and have another .
So i am not from vegas but my bf currently lives there .
Both sandwiches were moist , but not drenched with sauce .
The pastrami meat was soft and not stringy like how it can be elsewhere .
I may be over - exaggerating that part but alls i remember is that it was a large sandwich and i devoured that thing , no problem .
No qualms about the to - go sandwich .
3 ) parking : went here for lunch - no problem finding parking .
Do not go to vegas and not try it !
I do not know if it s just because it 's a friday night but i think the server should pay attention to their customer more .
Fun atmosphere , great food ( hint : try the gilroy with red sauce ... yum ! ) pretty much all the seats in the place have a good view of a nearby tv screen so you will not miss a second of the game .
There are also 1 - 2 other good vietnamese restaurants in mississauga but we do not like trekking that far for a casual dinner .
The broth for the pho is always very tasty , not watered down or filled with msg like a lot of other restaurants .
The owner is not too chatty / friendly but the service is ok .
There is not much to do in the area of wilson / keele so definitely have a car if you 'd like to head out afterwards .
The restaurant is always quite busy but you never have to really wait for a table unless you have a large group .
The chinese items on the menu are not something to recommend though !
I hate getting ripped off but i did not feel that at all working with these guys .
But must admit , it was not greasy .
Better than panda , not as good as chinese restaurant in chinatown ( phokim long is good ) .
We are doing low - carb and the salads here are very good ... the ahi salad is very good , and my husband enjoys the cobb ( no blue cheese and avocado on the side ) he gets ranch , and it is quite tasty , and i get the avocado , yay !
Not too much , not too little ...
I had a complicated issue with my jeep that no mechanic could seem to figure out .
This did not work , but they spent days trying to figure out what else it could be .
I know wiring problems are not cheap .
Although not all of the flavors were to my taste , i would say this was one of the best chinese restaurants we have been to in the area .
We ordered delivery once again from here and we just can not seem to get enough of it !
Sides : chicken fried rice ( best i have had ) chow mein ( good ) they do not add salt or msg to their food like others in the summerlin area .
So this is a plus for me as i do not like a ton of salt .
It amazes me sometimes when i go to a steakhouse that has not yet mastered the art ( science ? ) of cooking a steak .
That never happens at texas roadhouse .
My family has a range of preference from medium rare to well done , but no matter how many of us order , our steaks all come out at the same time and cooked to our liking .
We visit this location about once a month and i have honestly never had to send a steak back .
My family will not spend the money at a high end steakhouse downtown , but when we want steak , this is the only place to even consider .
Waitress can not remember what we ordered .
Never asked us our food was .
The food here was not so good .
I will not eat here again and can not recommend this place .
They do not use the roommate matching or whatever they want to call it , they are just trying to fill the rooms up .
It s awful , do not move here !
However , when the bill came ( and only a total number including tax on the bill , no breakdown for each item ) , we felt the number was not right .
It 's not a big money , but i still went to the cashier and asked .
I argued that we ordered medium size , not large size .
I said that i did not know it was a large size , and i never wanted a large size , because i could not even finish a medium size .. but the lady just insisted that because that was a large bowl you must pay for a large bowl . :-(
I am very unhappy with the experience in pho mi asia and i will never go back there .
I deeply doubt that they might not wash the basil leaves at all , because i found a piece of dirt on the leaf .
On top of that it was just really annoying when whenever we order a certain item ( eg. 6 orders of watercress ) , the person bringing out the food would almost never bring out the how much of what we ordered .
When we told them that we ordered 6 , the person who brought it out just kept nodding his head and saying " no no no " and bring like 2 orders out .
Maybe they did not want us to waste food , which i totally understand but that just meant that we literally had to order every time our server came cause our table wanted more watercress lol .
Not sure if it was suppose to be one per person but when i asked the server if i could have another one , he said yes .
I do not know if i will be back though .
I told them i was not interested in financing and that 's all they talked about .
Giving imperial garden three stars would be overly generous at this point , as the food really was disappointing , and was definitely not a-ok .
I will not get into the details of which dishes , but across the board that we have sampled , it appears that the chef has changed , and not for the better .
You do not come here for the food .
Service felt very corporate , i would not have thought that would be the case .
Also their space pablo , should not be called that .
We made a reservation by phone for a table for 7 people at 6:00 pm. upon arrival , the host stated that they had no record of it .
I had ordered coffee , and it did not arrive for more than 15 minutes .
Later , i ordered a refill after dinner , and it did not arrive for another 15 minutes , and this time , it was cold .
I will not be back !
The food was not ready immediately but this is not mcdonalds , and it was well worth the brief wait .
Service did not blow me away but nothing bad either .
Good tasting food , reasonably priced and wait time is usually not long .
My cantonese is not that good but they tolerate it lol .
I do not know whether it 's the fact that this location does not get a lot of traffic because it 's rather disconnected from anything else you might want to drop by for ( the only other storefronts in this plaza are basically a baskin robbins & a private driving school ) or because this place is somehow just cursed , but restaurants do not seem to stay in this spot for any longer than a year or two .
Service is below average because no one can speak proper english ( so be prepared to point at menu items or bring a friend who speaks chinese ) .
Do not drink their water though .
Service was attentive but not intrusive .
Was hearty but not heavy .
They have been consistent and we have not been let down yet .
Plus , they do not rush you out close to closing !
We arrived 15 minutes to closing and they welcomed us with no problems or attitude , i love that kind of customer service !
I do not know how they get away with charging so cheap !
You can not go wrong .
This is a little spicy from the fresh serrano chilies so be careful if you are not a fan of spice - we loved it though !
They give so much fried rice with lots of fluffy egg bits and it 's not too oily .
Pro tip : do not complain if you are ordering sweet & sour pork or honey walnut shrimp and you are on a diet - you should not be ordering that in the first place !
If you are not a regular and come in and order for take - out , everyone who is a regular and who order after you will get their orders before you ( to take - out ) .
I have never seen people treated with such disrespect in a restaurant - and no one said a word .
When i arrived tonight at 7 pm for my meeting with daniel , for which he said he would have the cars waiting out front , he could not be found .
Another employee tried to find him but could not .
Oh , it did not exist .
They could not find it .
Was not on the lot .
They only go off of the webpage . " why would you have somebody working for you that does not keep up with your inventory ?
And why do not you keep the website current with the inventory ?
No one comes to your to take an order , even we waved at them , unless we asked them to come .
Most of the time the waiters just chatting with each other but not serving the customers .
By the way , they never made a correct order as well .
My friend and i could not speak really well chinese but sadly we understand chinese .
The waiters were so rude , even my friend who can not speak chinese can feel that . i understand it is quite fun when you see someone could not speak your language well as they may make lots of joke .

Maaaan do not know where else you could find authentic spicy hot pot .
It 's pretty big place no wait time when we went .
Service was great they have those devices a at the table to call waiter was very effective maybe because the place was not busy .
I messaged him back that my current mazda 3 ( which i 'd purchased from cardinale way 3 years prior ) had a cracked windshield , a dent in the passenger side , and also had already passed 80 k miles , so i did not think they 'd be interested in buying it back .
Jc was very courteous throughtout our appointment , and worked to get me into a newer , much more well - equipped mazda 3 while only using my trade - in and no down payment .
And as a female purchasing a car ( yes , i went alone , no man to chauffer or assist ) , i never felt harassed , patronized or taken advantage of .
I honestly do not think i have had better bread in my whole life and it is great to see that they make it in house .
I can not can not can not find hair in my food or i lose my shit .
The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice ( chicken , pork chop , and egg ) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee .
Ps. try forget me not down the street , the only reason i was here was because they are closed on mondays .
Do not order anything else .
Do not expect friendly staff there .
My server took forever to clean up my table and handed me my check when my gf wanted to order the desert , server never bothered to ask us if we wanted dessert .
The decrease in lights , residence on property , and cars in the parking lot gives away the fact that not a lot of residence are home during these times .
Update : never got a reply from management , however i do see security more often on the property during dark hours .
Pho dac biet is definitely a staple for when you do not know what to get .
Everything ranging from bun cha gio to bun no hue is great .
39 minute wait for some $ 16 beyond edible salty chicken and soggy , thin , undercooked waffle and cold , not cheesy at all mac n cheese ?!
When you do not want fast food burgers or typical bar burgers , walk do not run here .
Avocados will not be reported missing , a slab of ortega chile takes the a burger to a whole new level !
Not sure if it is because my few exposure to bbh is from dinners with my vietnamese friends and families .
Their fried chicken wings was also a bit odd - the fried wings were not seasoned .
I never had anything like that before and thought it was just ok .
My wife and i have been taking our cars to kinkade's for the past couple of years and could not speak highly enough of the shop .
If you are looking for an inexpensive dining experience that gets the job done ( nothing above that ) , then this place is not bad .
If there was an option to give no stars this would be a starless location .
The apartment staff are completely inept , they do not care about there tenants and hardly do anything to help them when an issue arises .
There is no reason to wait 15 - 20 minutes before anyone will approach to say " hello " .
I is very ( very ! ) rare that we are not giving tip .
Is services is not good - we give less - but we always tip .
Tonight - we did not gave any - it was " just ignoring with no reason "
I always appreciate when the waitress gives suggestions about dishes or the quantity of food ordered and i find they are very honest with their suggestions - they are not just trying to get you to order more .
Cashew chicken probably is not the most adventurous order but was surprisingly bland .
If you are not too great with spice as we were , definitely ask to get the chilli gobi mild .
If you have not tried galub jamuna before it 's a delicious do nut - like fried ball in warm syrup .
I requested cashew shrimp " as spicy as they can make it . " aside from a couple pepper flakes , no spice .
Not sure what has happened to this place , but madison 's best no longer .
Customer service is fantastic , no complaints here at all .
I had heard of it for many years but have never eaten yet .
My fiancé and i have been coming here for a couple years and i could not recommend them higher .
Great experience , honest feedback , and fair pricing - what 's not to love :)
And service not as good .
Food came fast but waitresses not as friendly .
I overheard him say his manager would not allow him to pick up anymore tables because he already had so many and even so he was so polite and attentive to us .
Never an empty drink or dirty plate on our table ..
Atmosphere : nothing special , table was not well cleaned food :
1 . bun bo hue : way too much fish sauce , not a lot of meet , veggies were in fresh 2 . banh cuon : flour roll was unfresh overall : will not be back .
1 . bun bo hue : way too much fish sauce , not a lot of meet , veggies were in fresh 2 . banh cuon : flour roll was unfresh overall : will not be back .
I am not sure if it was coincidence or the way we looked ( dressed pretty casual .. maybe it was " us " ) .
I thought budgeting a time of 1 hr would be enough , but not at that pace !
There were little strips of carrots in the dish , something i have never had with this dish before .
Skimping on veggies are not we ?!
Staff is rude and the chicken was not that great ... they messed our order up and when we brought it to their attention they acted like we did something wrong .
I asked to order desert which is clearly on their menu board .... yet was told in a sarcastic tone that we do not have deserts here anymore .. then take them off the board ??!!!!
Not worth the money !!
I used to come here a while ago , and it was great , now it seems almost as if everything is rushed , i got the wrong order 2 times , which is very unfortunate , however , my wages had enough time to tell me that what i got is what i ordered knowing i m allergic to seafood , and i had shrimp on my plate , was a high concern , i do not know when i will be returning
Their games do not play .
As somebody that lives here i would never stop in here for a bite to eat , there are places that are generous and appreciate local business .
This is not one of them !
I really was not sure what to expect with the oysters in there , but it was a surprisingly refreshing little salty nip in with the other elements !
I would definitely go back , and i had a good time , but i do not think it 's a place i would crave on the reg .
On a weekend night the line can be a bit longer , but with the wine bar next door the wait goes by in no time !
To be perfectly honest i have not found that much of a difference between the 4 - 5 pho places in toronto in terms of the food .
I guess it s one of those things that most vietnamese restaurants can not get wrong .
Either that or i can not tell the difference .
The restaurant is located right at the end of a strip mall and is not too fancy .
I have not tried any of the other food here but going by the pho i do not think it should be too long .
Yes i would recommend as i have had to wait a lot longer other places which cost a lot more and was not happy with any of the food we ordered .
Service was not very good .
Dumplings were alright but not amazing
Waiters do not even smile .
Will not be coming back here .
I was not sure what to expect upon entering , but it was definitely a grand entrance .
I am going to do everyone a favor a post the number for security here , because you will not find it anywhere else : 702-530-5634 .
Our complaints were not taken seriously , which is incredibly sad considering we lived in the apartment where two former tenants were bludgeoned to death ( of which we were not informed when we signed our lease and moved in ) .
Security does not care at all , and management is much too concerned with getting paid the ridiculous amounts that they charge for every little thing to care about trivial things , like the safety of their tenants .
I am not a cheap person .
We could not even open our windows in the middle of the day without getting a huge wiff of smoke , and whenever we complained , no action was taken .
When questioned , management stated it was because there were charges from previous months that we had not paid , which was a bold - faced lie as we were never late on payments and always paid in full .
That was hilarious , considering there was a pile of vomit right outside our door for nearly 6 weeks that we had to step over to leave ( which maintenance " never got to " ) .
Not to mention the elevators reek of urine and vomit , and looked like they have not been cleaned since they have been installed .
They also tried to make my roommate pay $ 25 for a light bulb which was never even in the room when we moved in .
She was also charged for a dented towel bar that was damaged when she moved in , but since she moved in outside of the normal move - in dates , she was never given the correct paperwork to report the discrepancy .
Seriously , do not live here .
Las vegas is full of great apartment complexes in nice neighborhoods and staffed with people who not only know what they are doing , but also at least pretend to be concerned when problems arise .
My girlfriend and i came here on a thursday around 5 pm and had no trouble getting a table .
Sadly we will not be back to this location .
But you can not go for the decor or atmosphere ; it 's the dumplings , of course .
They are big , juicy , and i can not even finish them in one sitting .
The red been pancakes are also not bad .
By the sounds of these reviews i may have been fortunate not to receive any food .
The only con is that not all servers speak english and service can be a little slow .
Unfortunately , i am a fat ass and the booths are really cramped and i was not comfortable throughout dinner .
Absolutely no complaints the food was delicious .
Sadly , i was not very hungry at the time .
I went here once for their buffet as a kid and was not a fan but thought i would give it another chance now .
Price range ( not including tax & tip ) :
I was not a fan of the food at all besides the mutter paneer and naan .
The kothu roti had no flavour and did not have many roti pieces .
The portions for were not as big as i expected , i 'd say it was on the smaller side .
For the most part i do not think i would go again .
My wife vouches for their excellent entrees ; i can not .
We flagged them down repeatedly , but amid frenzied prepping to - go orders and serving other table guests , they never got my order out i cancelled my order when she 'd finished her meal , and we left .
There was much hilarious wringing of hands over my cancellation , but we simply could not wait longer .
Good place to have lunch , food is good and fresh however , i would not go for dinner their dinner menu seems a little overpriced but , lunch price is good because they have lunch specials .
Great staff except for this one young kinda chubby asian kid he has no personality and is a little rude .
It has change so many times i probably have not been to half of what it were .
( some of the cheese curds were kinda rubbery but it 's not bad ) price - wise it was decent , nothing out of the ordinary pricing for these kinds of food .
We all love spice and color in the way we eat and can not imagine being able to carry on a friendship with someone who does not eat like us !
I do not speak any mandarin and i kept trying to tell him that we were waiting for another friend .
I do not think he understood .
However , the quality of the food is not the best .
The luncheon meat ( spam ) was very slimy and does not really taste like anything .
A lot of the fish balls were not the best .
The scallops were not defrosted .
They were high quality scallops , but not prepared properly for serving .
This placed check out my car for free and let me know there was no safety issue .
Go , you will not regret it !
They were not nice but i have seen worse .
If they are on a wait i never have waited longer then 5 mins deff recommended trying .
The only reason these guys do not get a five is because the owners make different decisions .
At one i can get a hot ham and cheese while at another one they say it 's not on the menu so they say no .
That was plenty and i regretted not saving any room for dessert .
This restaurant may be a little out of your way , but if you take the time to seek it out you will not be disappointed !
I do not want to test your patience by going on and on about the sides , but i should .... pasta salad , sweet potato waffle fries , and oh the mac and cheese .
We finally departed with leftovers in hand , not wanting to leave one tasty bite on the plate .
That combo makes this place a special gem you should not miss .
The crispy noodles were not the same nor nearly as good .
Even though wine was still one the menu , it was not available ( maybe new owners had 'nt received their liquor license yet ) .
Ok , i am not from phoenix , but i get it .
It 's not the same as their main location in town , the service might be subpar ( which i did not experience ) , and it might take a while to get my food , but these are some damn good chickens !!!!
For example , if the menu described the og duck chaufa as what it was which was essentially fried rice with shreds of duck in it , i would not have been so disappointed when it came out .
I had no idea what to expect from morals village , but i was quite impressed with my visit here .
We assumed we would not have to wait , but when we got there , we had to wait for about 15 minutes .
It was not just broth .
I appreciate that the lamb , beef , and pork slices were overall less fatty than other hotpot places , in the sense that they did not have large fat layers .
I would have preferred more marbling in my meat , but this was not bad at all .
I do not know if they have a more english friendly translation .
Highlights from their menu include king oyster mushrooms ( prince mushrooms on their menu ) , watercress , raw shrimp ( fairly large ) , mussels ( also fairly large ) on their menu , two kinds of stuffed meatballs ( as well as cheese filled beef balls we did not try ) , and sliced ox tongue .
The highlight of my night was a fish ball for which i do not know the name .
It 's not as cheap as other places , but it 's definitely one of the better hot pot places i have been to .
I would not mind making a return trip here some time , but not today .
No frills nothing fancy good takeout .
Did not like the cold noodle because i like my food at least warm .
You are gon na lose so many customers if you do not lose her
We ordered them first then ordered appetizers , and did not get the drinks until we were 1 / 2 done with the apps .
Not spectacular .
A ribeye should not have excessive gristle throughout .
Will it take you to a place you have never been ?
Long story short , quality is not the first priority .
I was also asked to leave a good yelp review last time in exchange for a lighter tab , but was not on the platform then .
Would not change anything for me and i find it incredibly sad of them to even ask .
More of a morals review here , but i just can not support a place that is both average and desperate .
It 's chinese owned and run , does not have the usual flashy or modern signs that most people are accustomed to .
Not able to read a word of chinese , i let my friends order on my visit here over the holidays .
I do not recall the specifics of what was ordered but i do recall it was the tastiest dumplings i ever had .
Waiting for it to cool down for our first bite , we were not disappointed .
I have never ever had something like this everywhere but man oh man was it good !
It 's a little off the beaten path especially if you do not live in the area , but i would definitely come back again !
There are not many other latin restaurants in toronto , let alone one with the ambiance like baro .
They did not taste good at all .
I can not imagine this place will last very long at the airport .
If they do not close the doors themselves , i am sure sky harbor will kick them out eventually .
Upon going there , we were told they could not accept our coupon because their system was down .
The steaks and service were mediocre anyways , so we will not be going back .
Never went to the old place .
Not always a fan of thin crust , but good from time to time .
I wish were would get here more often , but do not go to breakfast much when not football season .
Not a beer drinker and the drinks are uninspiring to me .
Never been able to find a cocktail to like here . always clean .
We are not that frequent , but some friends are .
I wish i did not agree to share it lol el tipico 22 such an interesting combo of flavours , lights but perfect to share with 2 / 3 ppl so everyone can have a little taste .
I do not typically go for duck with the chaufa was a generous portion served in a hot stone bowl and full of flavour ( highly recommend to share 3 / 4 people ) lomo saltado the beef tenderloin is melt in your mouth and served with surprisingly crunchy veggies .
It 's good for that person who is apprehensive about latin foods or not a huge fan of unique combinations of flavour .
Chori papa 16 although this was a great taster for me , i personally am not a huge potato fan .
The mac n cheese had absolutely no flavor , the collard greens taste like a pile of sugar , cornbread was hard as a rock and again no flavor , and the chicken was not evan fried more like over baked with no flavor .
We actually sent almost everything back to the kitchen and choose not to eat it .
Highly disappointed in the service we received as well definitely will not return and tell others not to aswell .
I can not really choose which dish i liked best , they all had great qualities and flavour - it just kept getting better and better as the food came out !
It 's a bit small - long and narrow but nothing a few drinks can not cure !
You will not find these cocktails anywhere else .
They also have wine , beer and tequilas / rum etc if mixed drinks are not your thing .
The 2nd floor has a tapas style menu but since we did not try any food here i can not comment on the quality / taste .
With a buffet waiting for diners , it is a shame that you must make multiple requests for dosa ( served fresh , not on the buffet ) , water , and chai .
Not sure what keeps the waiters so busy with the buffet going on .
I have called management 5 times to try to see why i never received the initial bill to at least discuss or pay .
No response !!!!
Do not let your child move here .
Dumpling restaurant has been on my bookmarked list for a number of years , and i have never gone .
I have no idea how they came up with a concept to serve both together , but if i can get both , i will do it .
No pictures , but i will survive .
It 's not that the menu is particularly vague .
I did not end up getting my fish , but i probably will next time , and there will be a next time .
Not the best i have ever had .
On the dry side , but for the price , not terrible .
I can not remember whether it was 12 dumplings or 15 dumplings .
The pork bone soup , while not quite the flavor i attribute to a korean pork bone soup , was still tasty , and would satisfy a pork bone soup craving .
For you soup lovers , there really is not much soup in this bowl .
I can not remember if i put four or five bones in there .
So if you have do not mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste , then read on .
I do not even know if they are connected or what , but you see them both as you turn the corner .
Not so cheesy like a lot of chinese - american places in wisconsin .
I agree with other reviews - it s not the most adventurous food .
Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp was not very spicy at all .
Overall , if the food was not pretty good - i would have given this place one star .
Sounds like they do not fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things .
They are not for early risers .
I explained what a sangrita was , and how it 's a standard companion to good sipping tequila , but they did not have it or know about it , and i just thought , what a pity to spend all this money on this pretty place and know so little about what you are doing that you can not get even the basic things right .
And since my expectations were so predictably and efficiently met , i will not be rushing back .
I did not know it was even possible to have such a positive car buying experience !
It truly was one like no other .
Both corrie and cj were straightforward and concise , and we did not feel dirty after talking money because we did not feel we were being played .
- pool is not always clean - you can count on noisy neighbors and parties all the time ( specially when you have a huge test and want to sleep at 2 am , not gna happen ) although police activity is quite high - not a safe area .
Always piggybackers coming into the area , even saw a few homeless in the dumpsters - if you are not careful they will always try to overcharge you on the bill ( claiming electricity went high ) i also tried to ask for bulb replacements and they told me i was responsible for paying those ...
Uh no i am not , they were not working when i moved in so why should i pay to replace them ?!
- bullshit to pay for outdoor parking , there 's more than enough spots for everyone and they do not even check the stickers .
Plus no one parks by their own building so spot assignment would make sense to pay for - shuttle is only great when it runs on the scheduled time .
Not to mention today i found out the internet is down for the next few days ...
I work for a major airline , and i can guarantee i will not recommend this place !
Moved here not to long ago from huntington beach ca and found this great bar .
Chris the manager is on it when the crew is busy so you never wait for anything .
I was happy to find out happy hour does not end until 7 pm at sierra gold ( some places end too early ! ) .
We ordered two rounds of drinks , one of which included their " prickly pear " beverage ; the ingredients listed all sounded good enough to quench our thirst , but the end result was a little too " thick " for our liking and while the mixture was good , the consistency did not quench anything .
He was very honest with me and showed me all the defects in the car and did not even charge me because he felt bad that the car was in such bad shape and we flew all the way for it .
It did not stop there he helped us look for another car and even a hotel !
There are not many people out there that are good people like this .
He did all of this just to help us and did not charge a dime !
He reminds me of why i hate la sometimes because you do not get people like tj there !
I absolutely can not stand the sight of rare meat so when i get my steak back almost walking , i tend to get upset .
So i could not be upset with the service , but the cook needs a little refresher on how a steak is cooked correctly for the customers wants .
Can not beat it .
The italian is not bad either .
I really hope that they change the management of this place , because with this attitude they will not last long .
I might have just been really full from already eating the previous items , so was not so excited about this .
Always great sandwiches and service no matter what time of day or evening .
No matter which sandwich you choose , it is made fresh to order as you watch .
Every sandwich on the menu is amazing and you have to try the house special " sloppy joseph " ( do not pass up on the jalapeños and queso ) .
I realized that after not stepping foot into the restaurant for 12 years nothing had changed .
Do not get me wrong i love americanized chinese food , but this food just was okay .
We arrived pretty early at 9:30 so there was no wait at all but i have been here before around 10:30 and it could get crowded from all the people trying to make that 11 am breakfast special cut -off .
What 's a plus as well is that they give complementary chinese newspapers that you can take with you for someone who reads them ( if you do not yourself ) .
Capriotti 's is a chain , but do not let that stop you if you want one of the best italian subs in town , as well as cheesesteaks that rival what you 'd find in my hometown philadelphia .
I live in the neighborhood and often pop into this location ( in red rock resort 's food court ) to pick up a sandwich for lunch ( tip : park in the parking structure or parking lot closest to the highway so you do not have to walk clear across the casino floor to get to the food court ) .
Unfortunately , capriotti 's does not serve french fries , so they are unable to complete the holy trinity of unhealthy philadelphia fast food which i love so much - 1 ) cheesesteaks , 2 ) cheese fries , and then 3 ) tastykakes for dessert .
But i can not knock them for what they do serve at all , so thumbs up .
Not worth the buffet for 13.99 .
The buffet refills took so long that we did not eat most of the items .
So i moved out , and when i go to pay my last bill online , because i like to pay by cc , it no longer lets me .
I can not believe this place .
I just have never experienced someone eating while working on the restaurant floor .
Not true southern grits .
The small plates and main dish was not flavored or seasoned well , which created a blah taste in the overall experience .
We did not do dessert .
Overall , the space and menu is trendy / new , but not solid nor exciting .
We probably will not be returning nor recommending this place .
If you live here expect a call from a random collection agency a year after you have lived there claiming that you did not pay your last utility bill .
I called to see if it was true and they said yes and that they sent me a bill a week before sending me to collections which they did not because i received all previous mail from them .
I usually do not do reviews but this place is worth it .
Not only that when i was trying to pull in , since it was a busy day for them , there were some parked cars blocking the entry , after calling in they immediately helped me park .
I will no doubt replace my dealership visits and start coming here for servicing too .
Been there many times but my recent visit was a big disappointment that i will not be going back unless i run out of options .
Then she rushed us through the menu , told us to choose something else quick ( it was only 8:45 pm and it was not busy ) .
If it 's such an issue to order a $ 9 part , i can not imagine buying a $ 30 k car .
If you are thinking of moving into rebel place , do not do it !!!
Servpro ( frozen pizza ) crust , does not look like much effort went into this .
For $ 22 retail 16 " , it 's not worth the expense .
It is easy to get to , but tucked out of he way a bit , so it was not packed even though we went the night of the uw homecoming .
We can not wait to go again !
Listen and slow down i am not effin barbara for the millionth time .
Was not asked what bread i wanted and came w roll .
Not great , but not bad , either .
The menu was varied but there was not much on it that was terribly interesting or unique .
It was not bad at all but it was not mind blowing , either .
I 'd eat there again if i was in the area and other nearby places were busy or closed , but i would not make the trip to cramerton for it .
There is no taste , i do know how indian food must taste , it was tasteless and very cold .
Garlic naan did not taste anything like it .
And the worst part was falooda that is listed under dessert is not a dessert but is a cold beverage .
My voucher that had would not cover cold beverage and i was told do not believe what 's on the menu .
Never coming back here ever .
Tj is very straightforward about the work he will be doing on your vehicle and is never pushy or misleading .
I sat with a menu for 20 minutes and no order taken .
Lost a customer for life do not go hungry .
There 's not a huge menu , but you will find something to please everyone from the " chicken tender plate " to your more adventurous foodies .
I have never done a salad there , but i am looking forward to trying the wings at some point .
The outdoor area is very well done as well and i was particularly impressed by the fact that while part of the seating has a direct view of east washington , there was no noise to pollute restaurant atmosphere .
The staff are friendly and it 's not too expensive .
No respect to customer at all .
Terrible service , never come again .
You should never swear to your customer
Actually , it was a mission trying to find a place to eat tonight that did not have a ridiculous wait .
( + ) portions were surprisingly huge , which i do not quite get .
Lol i do not know why , but i love it !
One of our subs on our initial order was just plain wrong and not even close to what was ordered , but we were so hungry we just ate it anyways .
It was good , do not get me wrong , just not what was ordered .
I have dinner at mayworth about once a week with my friends , and we have never had a bad experience .
You will not be disappointed .
With the goat island park right across the street , i can think of no better way to spend a saturday than taking my dog for a walk in the park and then hitting the pub for a cold one .
The prices may be on the high side , but you do not have many alternatives in the area aside from pei wei , and you will pay the same there .
Purchased a vehicle tonight with no bs .
No add - ons that you do not ask for , no bait - and - switch internet pricing , no beating you down for hours to get you to take their lousy rip off price .
No pressure to finance just to get another " discount . "
Do not let the location scare you --
They do not put any fried noodles on the table ... if you want them , they charge you $ 3.00 ..ridiculous ripoff !
Mmmmmm , was not disappointed .
The place was not extremely busy , but busy enough .
Came by after the unlv game and the place is not too shabby .
The location on warm springs makes it a convenient place to drop into if you are in the area , not too busy .
The setting is nice enough , attractive , but not overly pretentious .
The meat was chewy , not the best cut , but not too bad either for the price .
The service was alright - i do not mind the no-nonsense , tough , but sort of friendly attitude , although my friends did not appreciate it .
I must mention that this is not 100 % korean restaurant and you will find a difference in some dishes they prepare .
Just go , do not ask , and do not tell anyone :p
I got a few pieces of chicken and a waffle , there truly is not anything special about it .
It surely is not roscoe 's chicken and waffles .
I told the owner that they can not refuse service to us in an establishment under the toronto bylaw .
They say they do not know anything about this service dog bylaws .
I even show them the actual laws from the city of toronto bylaws webpage and they still do not understand .
We will never go there again with that kind of ignorance !
Too bad i can not give them a negative stars rating .
The server never checked back until i went looking for her , wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering .
Could not eat it .
If it was not for the groupon deal , i probably would not know about this place .
They even have a keurig coffee station while you wait , but no tv .
They have shuttle service if do not ' want to wait .
It was never great , but it 's really gone down hill .
There is just no reason to go here .
Do not get me wrong , i would still recommend folks to try this place at least once and judge if they like it or not .
Unfortunately , that did not fix the problem .
I called in an order for pick up and when i arrived to pick it up the food was not ready and i had to wait another 30 minutes .
The staff was very rude and did not understand a thing , i had the manager ask me what i ordered about 3 times yet he still managed to mess up my order .
The manager offered no compensation for this inconvenience and did not even apologize for messing up my order , not once , but twice .
This is ridiculous , i will never be returning to china tango .
Not typical bar food .
They ran out of the rolls and cinnamon butter or could not make it for some unknown reason .
Therefore was never served any :(.
Not only did i receive poor service when i bought my car about two years ago , but they still call me and send me stuff in the mail .
He apologized and explained that they do not do those shady business practices anymore and asked me to come in for just 20 minutes ( so that he could try to convince me to trade in my car ) .
I told him again i was not interested in buying any car from anyone right now as my current one meets my needs and told him again to take me off the calling list .
They did not leave a message that time and i have not heard from them yet .
Not a bad place to be honest .
We got masala dosa and mutton biryani ; dosa was good , but if you are really hungry , the dosa itself may not satisfy .
This biryani had no smell whatsoever ; it was light and fluffy and simply delicious !
We were asked if we were collecting points ( at a restaurant ?? ) , which we had no idea about - but if the food is so good , getting a loyalty card would definitely be a wise decision !
Not a bad spot to get grub .
New location so not very busy .
Great tasting food and great value - the lunch special of $ 5.95 can not be beat .
Some of them may never have been on their own for the first time or come from impoverished households or they think the building is a hotel .
They can not even buy trash bags .
They do not pick up after their dogs .
The building is not the best quality but its newer . it s the problem that plagues all countries .
But if they did not grow up in nice homes , they do not know what to do with it and trash it .
The property does not have a staff dedicated to pick up trash left outside the units .
The property is not a hotel or a resort .
I have been living in this street for 2 years and no break in has occurred .
I do not think that any of the changes they made have brought anything positive to the restaurant .
I will almost certainly not be back .
It was not spicy .
I can not compare this location to any other texas roadhouse , but this is my boyfriend and my go to weekend dinner spot right now .
My filet has been cooked perfectly every time and thus far they have never been out of my boyfriend 's prime rib .
I have never had a bad experience here , very consistent food and service .
Not losing a star because i am not petty and i think a big part of the problem is due to bad customers , but the women 's bathroom is really , really bad .
I usually order these for delivery in summerlin , at the restaurant i had their egg - drop soup , which i enjoyed ( i do not remember egg - drop having corn kernels like this one does ) .
I have to mention , in all fairness , that they are not consistent in their delivery .
I pretty much expect something to be forgotten when i order from them these days , which is not a good thing .
I do not want to stop ordering from them because they have not actually messed up an order , but when you can expect minor errors , you have to start considering getting your carry - out from somewhere else .
I did not review this place yet ???
So are the chive pockets . we do not usually order the korean food here because the aforementioned dishes can easily feed 4 - 6 people .
We never leave this restaurant empty - handed .
I do not mind leftovers at all . :)
Do not use the washrooms .
I am a first timer at capriotti's and not much of a sandwich person at that .
This was in a casino though , so i am not sure how the prices compare to a standalone shop .
I am not a sandwich person , but i will probably stop by on another occasion .
Overall the food was more bland than i expected ( or too salty ) but i think they want to cater to those who are not used to a lot of spices and i get that .
I did not expect good food and friendly service at the airport .
Renting from rebel place is a scam management does not care about anything except taking your money .
The only reason they were not actual break ins was because we were home both times and were able to scare them away by turning on lights and making noise .
We reported them to management who said they would replace the windows but could not do anything about the security issue .
We called management , who said it was not their problem ... ended up calling the police , who connected us to 911 , and management still ignored the issue .
They do not clean anything before you move in - if you have absolutely no option but to live here i highly recommend renting a carpet cleaner .
Please do yourself a favor and do not live here .
The grilled beef is passable although , i find that they do not cut the beef into small enough pieces . nothing spectacular .
Avocado shakes - the reaction i get from most people is that avocado shakes can not be good .
I can not speak for the rest of their menu except that there 's a bajillion food choices .
They take orders quickly and food comes quick but service is not really pleasant .
If you are big on having a smiling waitress who will gladly answer any questions you have about pho and vietnamese , this is not your place .
I sprinkled on some soy sauce to give the dish at least sone flavor -- which i do not do , nor should i if the cook had done his job -- and it did not sit well on my stomach .
I will not come here again .
Do not come here !
They were okay busy on a friday afternoon and we got our table right away , but just as we put our order in , one xl of house special that the two of us were going to share because we were still somewhat full from breakfast , they sent it back , asked us to order more items and that they will not accept one item per two customers .
Would not go back , ever.
Had 2 different beers not normally seen on menus here .
If you are coming from down from 401 , the building is a bit angle to the south on your left side behind a parking lot ( try not to miss it =p ) .
Service : 1 / 5 - no one came to grab our dirty / finished plates . ambiance :
I was there recently and i have never met a more rude manager across all sorts of services i received in this country .
I do not remember his name ( some white guy ) but pamela , who works there must know his name , as she was also present there and must remember me when i was there .
He refused to answer most of my questions and was making insulting comments and was not at all interested in selling the car .
Seats are not comfortable , though nice decor .
The chicken is sometimes a little burnt and they just are not very consistent with the quality here .
I have not eaten the pizza , but friends and my fiance have , and it was pretty good for vegas pizza .
Perfect amount of cheese , not like the omelet house that makes my arteries scream for lean proteins .
My fiance does not like scrambled eggs but eats these scrambled eggs in a heartbeat .
I like it here , some pros and cons of it are : pros : - close to campus - shuttle that drives you back and forth - nice pool - management is pretty good , and will work with you - management team is friendly - live with college students - keep the complex up - kept for the most part and organized cons : - do not ask management to address a problem you are having with your roommates ( who are usually complete strangers ) because they usually will not - the rooms are dirty and need updating - maintenance team is pretty bad at actually fixing things , had to ask 3 times for them to fix and air and dishwasher , both are still broken . - this is no longer student living , there are students but a lot have left and now they let in anyone , including drug dealers - sketchy part of town - expensive ( $ 600 ) for a room , and usually they will find a way to charge you more money rather $ 75 late fee , $ 10 / mo parking pass and $ 10 / mo " insurance " or $ 90 for broken curtains , they will try to find a way

Just an update to say they do not even have the # 1 spot anymore as that goes pretty easily to ichiban on park .
If he can not fix it , no one can .
I was so pleased that i took my daughters other car to him and had it looked at and tj was able to fix it even though it 's a volvo which most mechanics are not that eager to work on .
Took it to cardinale the next day and they got right on it and had it up and running in no time .
I now realize that the spark plug had probably been going bad for a long time - but i did not know it .
So why did not the other dealer nearby ever catch it ?
The car has been there twice in the last year for oil changes and they never said anything .
But they could not identify a road noise as being a bad wheel bearing either .
I should have known any chinese place with phat thai is not going to be authentic .
Won ton soup , said no shrimp or veggies , bbq pork and chicken .
I got a container of all mushy won tons and no meat .
It was nice eating cold food cause you can not remember the rice ?
Do not rent from here - - seriously save yourself and do not even look on here , some of the amenities are good .
That is the only reason why i moved here but then after everything i have been through do not fall for anything they try to buy you into staying here .
I have tried to call right when they open at 9 am and they must not turn their phones on until later which was a big inconvinced to me , since i am the resident and was calling on my time when they were suppose to be open .
This place is not safe and all they care about is money .
Literally every time i see the office people they wo nt say hi and are not friendly .
I am living here and they can not be friendly and helpful ?
Girl at the register was rude , not helpful , and not interested in moving fast at all .
Love the restaurant locations , but will not be stopping here again .
The restaurant is really big so for the most part you will not have to wait except during breakfast on the weekends where it can get really busy .
Do not expect the servers to give you change even if you put $ 140 on a $ 110 order .
They totally deserve that tip for getting your order wrong , charging you for the wrong order , and telling you to suck it up if you do not like it .
Is this some new form of efficiency i have never heard about ?
Service : 3 / 5 , on point with attentiveness but at the same time , there were not a lot of people . ambience , 3 / 5 , great seating and large tables , so with a lot of dishes , you can place your items without crowding .
Price : 1 / 5 , the debit or cash only option is ridiculous and it came to about $ 40 per person which i am not sure is good for hotpot .
I decided to take advantage of their anniversary special on the .. bobbie for $ 4.... this was a full sandwich .. i also purchased a pastrami , full size ... guess what ... no signs posted for the special on the bobbie ... i had to ask them to get this .. bobbie ... at the special price .... guess what .... a few scraps of turkey , compared to the huge amount on the pastrami ?????
If you are going to do this ... why not sell all your sandwiches for $ 4 ... with scraps of meat ... duh.. shame on you
They checked my vehicle out for free and did a few things to troubleshoot and did not charge me .
My favorite quote , " i wish i could hit you over the head for being so stupid . " he also said , " i guarantee you the car will break down and you will wish you had the warranty . " that certainly did not instill confidence in this purchase i was making from them .
Prepare your self for no service what so ever .
The food is ok but the atmosphere does not have the same welcoming feeling that center street had .
The sunday brunch crowd is a very important crowd and it seems that mayworth is not interested in this .
The waffle was not so crispy and not too flavorful but forgivable .
The okra was not so flavorful either ; it needed some dipping sauce .
I did not have time to stop by before my return flight and i was a little sad ... oh well , next time then !
I have always been a fan of capriotti's , and when mom and pops was in town recently , rather than take them for their usual in -n- out fix , ( in - n- out does not exist in hawaii ) we decided to check out capriottis , since they have bomb sandwiches and is another business that is not available in hawaii .
Mom was surprised to see the size of the sandwiches , so i guess it was a good thing i did not order footlongs !
But as for the main course , there just are not many options ..
Not that great .
Not fd , but most chinese food is generally delicious .
I would not go out of my way to eat there , but it would be a place to go now and again .
It was not terribly crowded , nor loud .
When we told him our budget his tone became abrupt and somewhat annoyed , this after telling us that " it 's not going to happen , maybe a 3 , not a 6 " .
A bit over budget , but given the no hassle experience , this was not a problem .
And we highly recommend that you ask for darlene , you will not regret it .
Can not say enough about the quality of the food !
Also had the sweet and sour chicken which was not overly sweet like most place i have had .
I was not a big fan of the peppers in this dish , but it did not detract from the dish .
Not fast food chinese .
I had never felt more confident in a diagnosis and never felt like i was being overcharged .
But even with that , the employees are nice enough to reverse park into thier spots so that i do not struggle exiting onto 7th ave .
One bummer is they do not have hot brown on the menu ...
We were paying for " all we can eat " were not we ?
They never brought us more meat as we requested ; we had to tell them many many times and we ended up giving up and filled ourselves with udon instead .
Our waitress was not in the best mood either , gave us attitude and looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for refills for our 9 glasses of water and when we all wanted ice cream , she stated we are only allowed to have one scoop of ice cream as the dessert per person ( not reasonable for the price we have to pay in my opinion ) .
I will not be returning !
I got the help i needed , with the promise that the price would be upfront ( i ended up not having to pay for anything ) , and did not feel taken advantage of .
There was no flavor , or the flavor there was did not match the dish .
Do not live here .
They do not care about their tenants , and will take any opportunity they can to charge you .
Also , i am being charged for broken blinds which i did not do .
If they will not do anything for me , then i plan on contacting their superiors , until i get to the president and get this resolved .
Since it was ayce , it was very convenient for us not having to flag someone down all the time .
The place has a ton of tvs and so if you want a quiet romantic dinner this is not your place .
This was one one of the worst chinese meals i have had ... panda express is better , and i will not eat that !
I should have been clued in when i saw the " splash marks " not cleaned off the walls or the hard water stained glasses , but sadly i was craving chinese food so i overlooked the " ambiance " .
My brakes squeal because of brake dust and they do not need to be replaced at this time .
I was not taken advantage of and i was not ripped off !!
I will never take my car anywhere else and i will tell every single person i know who drives a car to bring their car here for work .
The man latin was good but i would not recommend if you do not like strong tasting drinks , it 's more of a sipping kind of drink .
Service not good .
Not only was the repair to my driver side mirror reasonably priced , but it was done quickly and efficiently .
The " siracha mayo " was not spicy , and the chicken tasted like nothing .
Our go to place , serve is quick but typical of asian places not nice but they get you what you need .
We go here because there are no better places .
Did not taste that good , and was quite boring and bland to look and taste .
The hostess was inattentive and working on the computer while we stood there waiting to be seated , restaurant was almost empty so no reason to wait .
Overall , food was okay , but not worth the price .
The flavour of food that you get here is unbelievable , i have never been disappointed with any of the dishes that i have ordered !!
It 's in the food court , so do not expect pleasant ambiance , bit a relaxing lunch nonetheless .
Did i not review this place ???
Geez ... it really must have not been very memorable one way or the other . :p
All kidding aside , i really did not see what all the fuss was about for their dumplings .
I am really not sure how i feel about this " fusion " chinese - korean food but i doubt that i will be making my way back here again .
I will not be going back to this capriotti 's shop !!
The owner called me and told me how did i know it was his store and i told him that i had not used my card before then or after then .
He then told me why was i upset since i did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money .
I told him it was the principle and then he called me " sweetheart " and i told him not to call me that .
I do not know why people think you are always out to get something .
Instead of acting like it could not have happened or it was your fault for purchasing with your debit card maybe an apology would have been better .
But let me be clear i will not be going back to this capriotti 's because of the owner !!!!
No complaints .
You really can never go wrong here !
The waitress kept apologizing but i do not know what the problem was but it was apparent it was in the kitchen .
I was told by the sandwich jockey that it is " a very popular sandwich . " well , if you are aware of this , then why not order / stock more ?
Please consider the vegetarians and do not have the meat in the red sauce .
They had us return 3 times and use up two days of my husband 's 3 days off for no reason .
We said we wanted to run the financing by our credit union but they acted like they did not hear us and pushed their own finance institution through .
We specifically stated no texts and we are getting them regularly .
No one was rude - they just did not seem to value our time or wishes .
When i am looking to fill a chinese fast - food void , i am not looking to see if the service is top notch ; i am looking for big value , freshness and flavor !
I loved how the shrimp batter is not too crazy thick and fried expertly to make it crispy for texture .
However , it is a tad on the sweet side ; you might be able to see the grains of sugar in the sauce not completely dissolved yet .
If you do not like your food extra glazed and saucy , i would skip this item .
I would not sweat the crab since there is no crab flavor detected , but if you ever had a cream cheese wonton , these are a great version - they are super crispy and delicious .
Just make sure to request some sweet and sour sauce to dip them in , if they did not come with it .
I will not lie and say that their service is awesome , but i can definitely see they are trying and working on improving , so hats off to that !
If you did not know , this type of service is not as bad as you think it is .
I saw a staff who drop a f.. king silly fish sauce on a gentleman jacket then she pretend like nth happened at all and she still laugh with her coworkers and may think the guy does not know .
Piss off will not go back to see their rude staffs at all .
Do not be fooled by the pub label however as this place serves up some wickedly good food .
The bar was not even busy and this bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ignore us and stay at the other end if the bar .
We each had 2 drinks and decided that the crappy service was not worth our business and left !
We will not be back !
If you are not smart enough to figure out that this is how you make money in tips and do not care then just quit because you are hurting the business that you work for !
I was having a great time until my check came and things that i thought were on football special were not .
Football special promotional card has item that are not included and they did not do anything to fix it .
One thing to note is they do not provide rental cars .
I am not sure if equivalent dealerships do generally or if that is more of an upscale car thing but anyways , you have to pay for the rental car .
Since that trip i have brought my car in for service where they fixed a small issue i was having but did not end up having to do much .
Overall , the staff there is very polite , but i at times felt a bit like they were " car salesmen " not to reinforce a stereotype .
I have been here for dinner but i went for brunch for the first time today and it did not disappoint !
The hot chicken was good , but not too hot !
Not cheap but a good value at lunch .
No delivery :(
The leases are not cheap and there is no service or sense of security that comes with living there .
There is no responsiveness if there is a problem , just a bunch of people ignoring you and passing the buck .
I sent the email requested over a week ago and no reply .
Love the tuna ... which is amazing because i normally can not stand tuna .
They have so many yummy choices can not wait to try them all !!!
Might not personally come back unless friends invite us .
Not too formal but definitely not a take - out joint .
But i could not stop tasting the sauce .
It was like no other white sauce i have tasted before .
Our server was " fantastic " never once i had to ask for a refill .
I have absolutely no regrets , and would recommend cardinaleway mazda , and madison spaid especially , to any one that knows what they want ( and is willing to wait , if necessary ) and wants a positive car buying experience .
Here is the long version of my story : this past july , i bought a new toyota corolla using a broker , a choice i regretted immediately and will never ever repeat .
I was in a rather unique situation ( credit report still showed i had a loan for the corolla , but , of course , i did not physically have the car ) , i had little to nothing for a downpayment ( since i had just bought a new car less than 2 months prior ) , and the trade in i had available was upside down about $ 3,000 .
I decided to create a form email to send to different dealerships to explain my situation , provide as much information as possible , and make it very clear i was not going to play the " come on down and we will waste your time for 4 hours " game .
I explained i did not have much time , and would not be purchasing any vehicle that night .
I did not have to retell my story , re-explain the situation , or re-provide any information .
I told her that i would not be able to do any of the deals they had proposed at that time , but that i was not in a hurry either , and asked about some other financing options .
With each communication , madison was always positive , never ever pressured me , and was extremely respectful of my goals and preferences .
Yet she accepted every time i said , " no , that 's not going to work , " with grace and newfound determination .
Had the curry chicken .... was pretty enjoyable but fried rice was not to die for .
No complaints this time :)
Pillowy bread , tender steak , and melty cheese served so fresh and hot i had to be careful not to burn myself with how much i wanted to keep taking more bites .
Slow with service but at least they were not rude ( just short staffed ) .
I would say the only thing i did not like was the fried noodles + seafood .
You can tell the noodles are fresh but the dish was under seasoned & did not taste like anything .
Came here on a wednesday night , luckily it was not very busy because we were able to be seated right away .
This is a rather less upscale restaurant but i can not complain much because you get your bang for the buck .
I would not bring anyone here to impress them but i would definitely come with family for a cheap and filling meal .
Not too spicy and not too sour .
A craving for strong vietnamese style coffee , no matter how heavily calorie induced the condensed milk is in the bottom of the cup .. the nerve of even counting calories !!!
My check - ins do not do justice to the many times i have come to visit but do take my word that their special beef soup is highly recommended to anyone in need for a quick , authentic and satisfying bite .
Delivered the wrong food , and did not pick up the phone when we tried to raise the alarm .
Whatever the food was they delivered was 2 - star quality , which is why i did not 1 - star them .
Very cramped and small tabletops are not good .
Nice place to go to have a beer and gamble if you are into that but do yourself a big favor and stay away from the breakfast menu the food is greasy and tastes terrible i had the chicken fried steak and eggs the chicken fried steak tasted like it was cooked in oil that had been in the deep fryer for a week i could not hardly touch it the staff is very friendly but i will take my dining experience elsewhere
Unfortunately , it 's not as great tasting as the green valley restaurant , but it 's good enough to visit again and again when in the mood for chinese .
The turkey chili had absolutely no flavor and was very greasy , i ended up throwing it away after two spoons of it .
I never had a traditional " thanksgiving .. in your mouth .. " type of sandwich before , so i did not know what to expect .
I never had a traditional " thanksgiving .. in your mouth .. " type of sandwich before , so i did not know what to expect .
- i am never a big fan of cold subs .
- my family does not have turkey , stuffing , and cranberry sauce during thanksgiving .
So i guess i did not know how to appreciate the sub .
I was not wowed or felt like i tasted a bit of heaven or anything .
It s just too bad it was not for me .
The location is easy for unlv and the strip , but the amount of noise your neighbors make , horrible management issues and plenty of overcharges on rent are not worth it .
Two years later i am getting debt collector calls , when in fact i paid all rent on time and do not owe anything to rebel place .. bunch of scammers that try to make money any way they can , even if it means selling your information and nonexistent debt to pesky debt collectors .
They do not even deserve a - 5 star .
We came here for lunch on a saturday of chinese new year and the restaurant was about 2 / 3 full , but they had ample staff there , i am not sure if this is a normal thing or they had anticipated that it would be super busy .
The peking duck was ok , it was not as crispy as i have had it from other places .
Variety is the spice of life and if you are with a group of people who can not decide on one kind of food to eat , this would be great place to take them .
Not over spiced and greesy .
One guy was waiting for his food .... did not see any other customers .
My golden waffle was soggy , not crispy .
Dumplings here are good but service is not so great .
I was turned off by it and was not looking forward to eat there .
Because i did not think this place is clean / sanitary , maybe i did not enjoy it as much as i would like to .
Never disappointed .
The dishes are always made perfectly and fills you up no matter what .
You can even get vietnamese drinks here or just bubble tea , and it 's not that bad either .
It may not be the obvious mouth - watering choice , but the flavors are so good together .
The lighting is soft and not too bright .
Service was not bad since one of my friends is a regular here .
I ordered a side of fries , and they were not stingy about it - plenty of fries to share with other people .
She could not remember our order .
Seriously , it does not take long to fill up a drink and give it to the customer .
We did not have to wait for a table even though the parking lot was very full .
They also give you unlimited dinner rolls and buckets of peanuts , so there is no way you are leaving hungry .
My husband especially liked the set - up they have where the hostess grabs the basket of warm rolls from the kitchen window as she takes you to your seat so there is no waiting .
The beer was not overpriced either .
I will never request that we eat here again , but if i am in a situation where i am obligated to go , i will not be mad .
Chettinad chicken masala the sauce is good but chicken little pieces bones they cut the chicken tight into 4 not good for the value $ 12.99 rate poor boneless chicken biriyani was excellent .
Fish fry was not fresh very fishy .
No waters not even greeted .
The bartender watched us come in and never bothered to help us .
How ever he did continue to help the belligerently drunk guy who would not stop burping .
Never again !
There was great communication throughout the day after i dropped off my car about what was going on with the car and what needed and did not need to be done .
The flavors were bland , no authentic taste .
I did not have a chance to sit at the bar , but next time for sure .
Can not wait to come back .
- they mistakenly brought rye and gingers instead food - the food came out before the drinks which was not a good start - the chips and guac were very tasty , would have paid 7 $ for this not $ 15 - the tostada was just a giant chip loaded with guac , under it i may have found a tiny bite of chicken - flank steak with chimmichurri was not warm - the tamale was a giant corn cake that tasted like cardboard , very dense and completely under seasoned also could not taste any chicken in it overall the decor and atmosphere were good but compare the prices and food to other great restaurants in king west i would not return or recommend to anyone .
Sorry to say but both the food and service are not good .
Not very welcoming / nice overall .
The imperial chicken was very soggy and tasted a bit uncooked , the ingredients do not seem very fresh , the portions overall are small for the prices .
Tea does not come with a tea strainer inside and all the leaves poured out as i drank from my cup .
Help and service are so slow and every single time i asked for something , the waitress sternly told me to wait or hold on a second after she finished serving others first very americanized chinese food , not so authentic , on the salty side oh and the crispy noodles are like those things you get for free when you order chinese take out / delivery ( like those fried wonton chips ! ) - they said that that 's all they have for the crispy noodles , so i do not recommend getting the chow mien crispy noodle dish because they are not like real noodles after all :/

The food is always good and fast but not hurried competent service as well .
I came here to celebrate a friend 's birthday not too long ago .
Management can not calculate rent correctly .
Unless you area 17 year old college student who can not afford someone else , do not rent rooms here .
Too few south indian options on the menu for a south indian restaurant .. n the sambhar was tasteless .. more like tasteless daal .. no south indian masalaas or veges in sambhar ..n d idlis were anything but round and soft .. will not return ..!!

Because it ended up being a bigger issue than anticipated , they did not charge me at all for the work they did and gave me a fair quote for a full a /c replacement .
Of course , they were the first people i thought of to call today when my car would not start because the ignition was jammed .
To my surprise , they answered the phone even though it was after hours and then to my even bigger surprise , the man i talked to on the phone actually came out to see what was going on with my car and although was not able to fix it immediately because a part needs to be ordered for it , he gave me great advice in the meantime completely free of charge .
I could not ask for anyone more knowledgable or helpful at what they do , and they really put me at ease about my car which is probably the most helpful thing in a situation where something is wrong with your car , because we all know it 's a crappy feeling !!!
Not only did they get every delivery correct they were ontime .
Do nt even think about leave your jacket at that service were you pay 3 $cdn for they re completely disorganized that systems they have do not work propertly
It was not great .
Not awesome .
Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys ( not my thing , but everyone else liked it ) .
Not so great .
At least not the service field .
But was disappointed he did not get to witness that .
Both times lol ( not funny tho ) an item we ordered never arrived at all , but was not billed so we did not bother mentioning when we paid .
But she never offered to check on the item for us ... hellloooooo geeez finally mentioned to a manager ( owner ? ) who was going to check , until the cashier said she would ... but then she never did .

Made my experience hassle free and i was in and out with my dream car in no time at all !
I was very well educated about my options and could not be more happy with my decision to do business with them !
I did not once feel pressured which is very uncommon when looking for a car .
Still not open at 8:30 .
I was hoping to make it to work on time looks like that 's not going to happen .
Keep in mind , this is not a strip property ; a neighborhood bar .
Not true .
We will not be going back .
Although parking is limited , i strongly advise you to come when it 's not common lunch / dinner time .
I am not a fan of ginger and is quite sensitive to the smell and taste of it .
For people can not handle the smell of heavy herb or spices i would not suggest this to them .
I did not get to try it myself .
Do not expect this place to be fancy and do not expect the service to be superb .
What arrived certainly did not taste like fresh - squeezed lemonade .
It 's sad that i was not told the truth before i ordered ( and paid for ) it , especially after the exhaustive number of questions i had asked .
In the past , i did not know i was ripped - off , because i was tired when i closed the deal .
Now , i am prepared to walk out of a dealerships because of a inflated final price that was not exposed ( this is common ) .
Cardinaleway does not do this ; the price they quote is what you pay and their quotes have always beaten other mazda dealerships .
Can not wait to go back there again .
She is not indian so this was her first experience .
They were not that crispy either .
I expected more from china tango because they are not considered to be a fast food chain so i set my expectations higher .
The food did not leave me wanting more it made me lose my craving for wings .
This is as close as we are gon na get and let 's face it vegas does not have good chinese food .
Our menu consisted of : masala dosa and mysore masala dosa , sambar ( i did not realize that the dosa came with 2 each or i would not have ordered it , but it is awesome ) , garden salad , chicken biriyani , butter chicken ( this was just ok , a bit too mild for my taste ) and naan .
I told the salesman if i drive 14 hours one way and this jeep is not in the condition he has described i would be beyond mad .
Still not open at 8:30 .
I was hoping to make it to work on time looks like that 's not going to happen .
I never did get my service done terrible .
I have been to a lot of indian buffets and was surprised to find that they did not have paneer or butter chicken or any of the masala dishes that i normally see in an indian buffet .
Heck , there was not even naan there .
I was so sad that i could not find the gulab jamun !
This is the first time ever that i did not go back for a second helping in a buffet ( i am normally a glutton , what can i say ? ) .
They advertise their buffet saying that there 's over 30 items in there but there definitely was not .
The food also was not very appetizing for me to even want to go for seconds .
A lot of the food just is not that great compared to other buffets .
Of course , i do not expect fine dining with an indian buffet but having gone to quite a few of them , this is one of the worse places i have been to .
But given the quality of the food they rolled out for the buffet , i will not be back to try their menu items .
I do not expect much more from an ayce restaurant .
For this price and the amount of peppercorn i ingested , i do not think i will be back any time soon .
As jennifer noted in her review , you might pass this obscure dumpling house every day of your life and never have noticed it .
By 7 pm saturday this place fills up ( do not let jennifer 's typical empty restaurant photo fool you ) with a mix of chinese and koreans ( based on a visual sampling of the newspapers patrons were reading ) .
I was the only honkey ( " ko jang eee " [ 1 ] ) in the place but my lone arrival caused the staff no consternation , hand wringing , or sucking of air through the teeth .
Despite being koreanized chinese food and sinotophied korean food , there was no korean on the menu .
Avoid this one ( ie the kimchi fried rice ... not the restaurant ) for sure .
I did not think an honest repair shop was around any more in the phoenix metro area .
The morning of the estimate , my car was not turning over for about 10 minutes .
He responded , " oh no , it s not cheap " .
He further stated that they could not replicate the other issue and he , " did not feel comfortable replacing a part for the sake of replacing it . "
I could not believe the integrity of this auto shop and felt like i just found $ 1000 in an old pair of jeans .
If you are reading this right now , i highly recommend you never sign a lease with rebel place .
When i first signed the agreement , i told them i want a girl roommate because i was not comfortable with co -ed , and they said of course .
I did not grow up in nevada so i would go back and forth to see family and friends from my hometown when i am on break from school .
I was not in town when all of this was happening but one day , i come back home and see a half naked man in my apartment .
I obviously panicked because i specifically told management that i am not comfortable with a guy roommate .
It 's dirty and not safe here either .
I mean we pay $ 700 - $ 800 for one bed and one bath in vegas and they can not even hire for maintenance staff , more friendly management workers , or security at night ?
All my money is going to waste here and i just can not wait until my lease is over and i am so done with this place .
So , i highly do n't recommend signing with this place .
I was invited out for hotpot and since i do not get it that often i was delighted to go .
I am not sure what the name means , perhaps it 's an inside joke or something .
All in all it was not bad , but not really worth the wait .
Overall , not bad but could be improved .
Ok ... another hk fast food rest. , well this is not my first time here however this time was the worst service ever .
Walked in , standing there for 10 mins , no one came to greet us ( party of 2 ) , mind you , there are empty tables , finally got a table .
I did not expect super service when i know i am eating at a chinese fast food rest ... but still how can you give the same cup , same drink to a customer that was returned ?
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
I do not regret it .
I can not wait to eat there this summer so we can sit in what looks like a terrific outdoor courtyard .
It was my first one and i do not know if all juleps are as potent as this one , but it really packed a punch .
On our first visit we ordered the cast iron cornbread ( i have never eaten corn bread so moist and flavorful ) and pimento cheese ( charred onion , pecans , crackers ) .
The latter was good but not a standout .
For our entrees , i had the brisket pot roast with root vegetables and potato purée on both visits and i do not know if i will ever order anything else .
The front driver and passenger windows have barely any tint , which does not block out the sun enough ( glare and heat ) .
Also the front windshield does not have any on the very top .
Not too happy about that in the summer because that means using more ac to stay cooler feeling .
The only reason i bring this up , is there 's a built - in charge to the vehicle showing the dealership tinted the windows , and it was not inexpensive , so it should be much better .
No apple carplay ( i am hoping for a display update in the future )
The portions are really too large for one meal , especially since it 's located in an airport , and most people can not take leftovers home .
This is an okay location that does not seem to get overly crowded .
The bar is fairly large and we have never had a problem finding a seat in front of the gaming .
The food is standard bar food so not bad , but nothing notable either .
The only thing i do not like it the wait time .
I have never seen orange hot and sour soup and if the color did not turn you off , the taste certainly did .
I can honestly say i have never had anything like it .
We also order a chicken dish and to be honest i do not know what it was supposed to be and i do not remember what it was called .
We were not looking for gourmet , just someone to feed us a warm meal after a long day .
Unfortunately the food quality was that bad and for the price ( which was not cheap ) we expected something at least reminiscent of chinese food .
Nevertheless , we will not go back .
The only issue i had was the channai paratha was over priced and not worth the value .
We may not ever be going back .
3:30 rolls around and now we are being told they are not taking seating for parties over 8 people .
Spoke to a manager who basically said ' i do not know what she told you that ' you should not have people answering the phones on mother 's day if they are not aware of the policies .
They also said they could not accommodate us in any way .
' i can tryyyy but you 'd probably be at two tables ' now we are scrambling to find somewhere for mother 's day and could not be more disappointed with the bad information from texas roadhouse .
I do not think i have ever had a bad experience here , although my visit on april 1 was borderline .
Not until they brought the check did they offer to refill any sodas .
- people are definitely not as nice as they are on the phone when you are inquiring about this place .
- close to campus but this is just not in a safe area .
They do not use it to assign you a roommate .
- the property is not secure at all .
I now have serious anxiety issues and the worst part is that i can not even be comfortable in my own apartment because my roommates are the exact opposite of me .
I can not say it was the best one i have had but i can not say it was the worst .
The pieces of beef brisket were huge , definitely not bite sized chunks .
Problems : new crispy noodles are terrible , service seems to have gotten a bit worse , they messed up my order and were slow to refill water ( never refilled ) .
If you have not been to julep , get there fast !
My husband and i decided to go there for a drink before heading to dinner elsewhere ... well , we never left !
It 's kind of a hidden place in the same tiny strip mall that has had the cheapest ( asian ) hair cuts for 15 + years if you do not care how you look .
The decor did not have anything to it , i took a photo of one of the rare items that make this place indicate any signs of being korean resto as well but now i look at it , it looks like its written in chinese .
My meal is not complete without a bowl of noodles !
This is one of the few places i would eat " water cooked fish " because i am not big on spice .
Nonetheless the fish was great and the spices was not overwhelming .
The beef in the soup was not right .
It had a strange colour and smell and the broth had no depth whatsoever .
Me and my gf are fairly easy going but quickly agreed we are never coming back .
But pho soup was very salty , noodles starchy , and beef brisket tough like rubber - we asked for our bill to get the hell out , the lady pointed us to cashier , no word .
* waffles were spongie * syrup was watery * not only is a bun a sandwich option ...
It 's the only option ... cmon guys . * no need to discern the lemonade from the kool - aid amd it 's just lemon flavored kool - aid
The grits had more of a modern twist than your traditional grits , it was not creamy or cheesy .
Get the sloppy joe fries - you will not be disappointed !
But on a thursday night i walked up to order no one in line and no one ahead of me .
I figure my sandwich would take 5 mins tops since there was no one ahead of me .
I look on the counter not only was my sandwich sitting there .
I get no reply , no apology no offer for a discount nothing the kid was speechless and could not answer a simple question .
I do not recommend going to this location they you make wait a long time for one sandwich mind you and are rude .
I am a regular at the casino and spend a lot of money there i do not appreciate some rude kid giving me attitude over a $ 10 sandwich .
Was told we did not need a reservation and the woman who i spoke to over the phone recommended the private lounge area so that we could close the curtain to block off the noise and crowds .
We were given our checks , and again the host had no problem with the large group of us each having a check and each having a different method of payment .
Pho ( rare beef pho ) is not too oily compared to some other vietnamese restaurants . -:
Service is not good .
No wonder the taste and flavouring was so strong and unique .
It was a sublime departure from most any other outdoor seating option in madison ( no bustling sidewalk traffic / loud cars driving by ) and the cocktail i tried was quite good though i can not remember exactly what it was !
Sounds amazing - can not wait to spend many nights dining and drinking there .
I am not a huge pho fan , but their pho makes me crave it sometimes !
No matter what noodle soup you order , it will be full of taste with lots of ingredients .
Restaurant is not fancy at all and service is not extremely friendly too , but the food is what makes me come back !
Does not taste too heavy at all !
I did not like that the pork inside seemed very loose .
Went for happy hour which i am not sure what time it started but was until 7 pm .
I have been to pt 's on silverado and maryland for hh and it was never this busy !
There are pool tables which were not in use either .
Pt 's never made us buy that , nor did my friend say she needed when going to sierra gold previously .
No appetizers .
She pretty much went down the whole list and would have continued if my bf did not say he got the point .
My husband and i ordered takeout of lo mein noodles and shrimp fried rice , they both had no taste .
Do not make southern food hipster ... that 's just not ok .
My real problem with this place is the service : the menu was misinforming and did not specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish .
I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager .
The manager only ended up refunding me 50 % off the item ordered and began telling me how you would not refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant !
In the end , i paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress , but i will never visit this place again .
I am not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because i was a young college student or what , but her management skills leave much to be desired .
So , i will start this off by saying that no one ever likes to get their car repaired ... especially in arizona ... and certainly when that repair is associated with the ac. knowing full well the potential cost of the repairs , i approached my search for a repair shop with caution .
Tj gave me options , letting me know what he recommended , but not pushing needless repairs on an already expensive situation .
I thought of saying something to the hostess at the time , but did not .
I wrote in the interest of the success of the restaurant , not seeking anything in return .
What is most shocking about this experience is that i received no reply at all , not a thank you for alerting them , nor an apology .
Needless to say we will not be returning anytime soon .
It is inside of the red rock hotel so you have to walk through the casino to get to the food court but that is no big deal .
Being raised by a vietnamese mother , i have had good , authentic food my entire life , but when she does not feel like cooking something that i am craving or when i want comfort food this place is where i go .
Service is as expected for an asian place , not very personal , the servers are just focused on bringing you your food and then you eat and you are out .
Him and his team take exceptional care of me and my vehicles explaining everything in detail and set themselves for a standard of care the most mechanics do not .
Extremely happy to be a concave loyal my vehicles will always go there and i will never worry
The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or " questionable " .
The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken - like material found at lesser establishments . we do not dine in often or at all .
The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken - like material found at lesser establishments . we do not dine in often or at all .
Just not my preference .
If you do not mind a more formal setting and have the time , go ahead and dine in .
Customer service is not .
The salesman who helped me does not even work there anymore .
Spicy with no true flavour .
Service was not the best .
I am the type of person that does not eat out a lot and we find this place pretty good compare to congee queen just down the street .
Their pork bone soup is possibly the best i have tried despite the fact that it 's not entirely a korean restaurant , they do however offer many korean dishes in addition to the chinese menu .
But since they specialize in northern chinese cuisine , it 's not a surprise that there 's an overlap in the tastes and similarities between northern china and korean cuisine .
That is not true at all !
I tried a sampling appetizer , dumpling , sweet and sour chicken , among other things and there was simply no flavor nor originality .
I do not recommend this place .
A good note is the waitress was great and the decor is fun but that 's is not what i go out to eat for ...
A little more " luxurious " than your run - of - the - mill pt's , but not " stuffy " .
The interior is well lit for a bar - not too dark ; not too bright .
The burger meat was so good you did not need mustard or ketchup .
They unfortunately were not hot , at all .
I 'd been hoping for them to be a little spicy but nope , not at all !
We had the mayworth chicken to share since we were not that hungry .
Will never eat here again .
There is no clean chicken soup like at other places .
However , the mushroom soup was not very special .
I could not taste much mushroom and it was too salty .
They did not even refill my water until i asked them to twice .
As well , you do not get to self - serve and mix your own sauces ; you tell the server the kinds of sauces you want and they bring them to you in little bowls .
They also did not give spoons for the little bowls until we asked for them .
If you like really spicy , i recommend the spicy beef balls , but other than that , the other balls were not that good .
The ice cream was not very smooth but still a nice addition to hot pot .
Overall , the service was good and it was a decent experience , but i do not think there 's anything too special that would morals stand out and make me want to visit again .
A great restaurant back in southlake , tx , but the phoenix airport lolo 's food is not good , service is slow and the lemonade is watered down .
I am not sure what happened , but something seemed amiss last weekend .
I could not put my finger on it , but it seemed like there was less filling and broth inside the wrappers and the bamboo steamers they came in seemed to waft with a funky scent .
Sanitization was never the restaurant 's strong point , but i just could not let the smell slip my mind .
Do not waste your time .
Never had chinese food this bad .
Standouts : the perlou - crispy rice and seafood so tasty that my boyfriend cleaned his plate even after he 'd filled up on apps ( i should mention that even for a large group , we were able to share most of the apps , which was great because we could not get enough of all the different flavors - oops , except the biscuits , pretty much everyone wanted to get their own - love at first bite ) - the collard greens that came with the subtly spicy fried chicken - full of shaved fresh garlic and sweet / spicy with a silky vinegary finish , not your average bland collard greens - and the shrimp and grits , which were the best i have tasted in this city .
But i can not stop thinking about the sweet potato pie - it 's what sent me back here to write a new review - somehow managing to be light and fluffy yet sumptuously rich all at once .... mmmmm .... went perfectly with their bourbon milk punch !
Our server handled our table of 10 + graciously and efficiently , and there was no waiting for water , table clearing , fresh drinks , new utensils , etc .
The place is quite big but i have never seen it being fully packed .
I have not had a bad experience yet !
You pay for the food , definitely not the service .
Trying - because there were not enough chairs for everyone .
We had maybe 6 menus at our table of 15 , half of them in chinese which majority of the party can not read .
The food is good quality and fresh , so i think you really are paying just for the food and not the service .
The servers seem young and not trained at what they do - the resto is busy and the whole eating experience is confusing and chaotic .
I just returned from barcelona last november and had some wonderful spanish tapas there so i was not too impressed with the food at baro .
I had no problem paying for a bottle of wine that i ordered but i figured i 'd ask the waitress out of curiosity what the wine was supposed to taste like in case there was something wrong with it .
They basically spoke around ten min later in front of our table , and although she apologized for the delay , the manager never once approached our table to find out what the problem was or came to make sure we were doing alright .
The waitress came back to our table and took the bottle ( which was not empty ) and said she will get someone at the bar to taste it .
I thanked her for checking and made a mental note not to order that wine again .
Although i did not like the wine , it would have been nice if they returned the bottle that we not finished so one of my other girlfriends could have had it .
I found that this was very unacceptable and was insulted that the problem was not rectified in a manner that was not speedy or satisfactory .
I ended up paying for the wine , which we never got back and still received no word from the manager .
I walked out feeling like i did something wrong by asking a question about a shitty 50 dollar bottle of wine that we never even got back .
Kitchen m is directly across from markville mall & i can not stress enough how every employee should go and eat there for their break .
My friend & i got seated right away and we shared a beef ngau hor ( beef noodles ) for roughly $ 9 . it filled both of us to the point of where we both had to fight over who did not have to eat the last portion .
The waitresses are all somewhat middle - aged chinese women and they do not really care about all the ideals that society holds .
They do not smile , they do not say thank you , or try to interact with you and ask about your life - they honestly just do their job efficiently ; with taking your order , bringing your food , and clearing your plates .
I only get take out but i have never had bad food , a wrong order or a rude person .
Breakfast " sandwich " was a waffle with scrambled eggs ( no cheese when there was supposed to be cheesy eggs ) all on one side and the bacon piled on the other side .
Not even touching .
It was very creamy but not very cheesy .
I have not tried them on the weekend it .
Our experience first and certainly not last experience at mayworth's was great !
The booths were not padded which is fine to me as some restaurants have sunken booths that are uncomfortable .
The patio area was not offered but the option is there .
I wished the area was not so fenced in .
The service is also fast and effcient but never friendly .
This is a good place if one 's expectation is affordable vietnamese quick bite , but definitely not a place for social gathering .
But i would not recommend rice dish although the portion is filling .
I have never seen the owner here smile so do not expect too much on service .
If you are use to americanized chinese food , you may not like this place .
The dumplings were huge ; huge does not even begin to describe it .
I am used to getting a fried egg on top of the rice and we did not get that .
Would not order this again .
It 's signature food is dumplings , do not have any expectations for non-dumpling dishes .
Unfortunately that was not the case period i i grabbed my meal walked 20 feet and sat down at a table to try it out .
The waffle was soaking wet and not even close to being done .
The chicken was very average but no better than something offered at chains like raising cane 's for a quarter of the price .
What was most disappointing was there was absolutely no flavor to the chicken tender at all .
Sure , it was fairly juicy but if you did not dip it in the ranch you might as well drink water because it was tasteless .
Unfortunately foil does not taste well .
We usually start off with a baby blossom , which is your typical deep fried onion , but it has a unique seasoning , which is not awesome .
You have your choice of sides and they include items like green beans , which have bits of bacon and a very salty , smoked flavor ... not your typical green beans .
Of course , they offer seasoned steak fries , but the seasoning is not awesome .
I have eaten here over 10 times and i have never been disappointed .
One star was taken off because they did not pick up their phone .
A wednesday night dinner for 3 did not needed to wait long , also i was just a little shocked that i had to pay extra for soup base and drinks , whereas many other places came with it for free .
Food was good , i could not complaint about it .
I can not say enough about them .
The most recent fix was a reconditioning of my headlights , which were so hazy that another body shop did not even want to work on them .
The soup was not that bad - i did add about a tsp of light sodium soy sauce .
It was a sweeter dish , but not overly so .
It was not hot at all - in fact next time i go i will ask them to kick it up a notch .
The fried rice was what suprised me the most - not at all greasy and great flavor .
I did not come for the ambience as we just sit and gab the whole time .
They were very diligent in ensuring our soups never ran low and refilled it periodically .
Personally , i have no complaints about the food and was happy that ice cream was not limited lol .
I was looking forward to trying this , and it did not disappoint .
Meat was not too salty , portions are huge , and the mix of slaw , meat , dressing and bread were perfect .
The staff were friendly and very attentive ; my water glass was never half - full .
Do not bother ordering kadhai chicken .
Curry chicken rice 11.99 and other place never go above 10 . drink are bad too .
Not recommended
The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff was not as amazing as i hoped for .
For starters , the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger .
Do not call a dish , sea bass with mixed veggies and call a few sliced onions carrots and green onions so thinly sliced they were barely recognizable with mixed anything ... who give this place 4 or 5 stars apparently also eat at fast food places and think it 's a good meal .
Service was excellent , food was simply not memorable at all .
While i concluded that it was most probably ok to finish eating the food and that what i found is something that is not non-veg ( as i am a vegetarian ! ) , i was still disturbed by the experience .
Waitress came back and said that i could have gotten another dosa but since i finished eating what i ordered i am no longer eligible and that it will not be taken off the bill bc they are already doing their anniversary promotion and so they can not offer another discount .
He repeated just what the waitress had told me which is that since i finished the food , they can not offer me anything .
What was evident from the conversation is that the managers and especially the owner have no customer service skills and they have no interest in looking after customer satisfaction .
What was really interesting in the conversation with david is that no where in our conversation he took the ownership for their mistake which includes but not limited to : a ) sending a waitress to address complaint instead of a manger , b ) not informing that the object is in fact rice and not something harmful , c ) not offering apology , d ) offering a deal that apparently expired because i finished eating the last bit of dosa i had in my plate , e ) telling me that because they were doing a promotion for their anniversary , they can not offer another discount for me ( which was a very foolish thing to say ! ) ..
They focused on helping me not their commission .
He does not sugar code anything & is the best !
I can not even begin to explain how amazing he is !
Tj explained that the part itself was not costly , it 's the labor .
So seeing that it was not a simple repair , he was nice enough to clear out the service light for me , and that if it goes on again , and the same diagnostic test comes out , then it 's time to do the repair .
And for any future car repairs , it 's nice to have peace of mind knowing that i am not getting ripped off at the car shop .
I have not tried any of their non-lunch specials .
Most asian places do not include soup unless you dine in .
It 's not the best nor the worst chinese food i have had but definitely hits the spot when you want chinese food .
I have not dined here but the service is decent .
Came here about a week ago for the first time for a friend 's party , in fact i had never been to any sierra gold before ... only pt's .
Definitely was not expecting it .
It was also pretty cool to see tvs in the bathroom mirrors so you can continue to catch the game and not miss any action !
Rebel place does not deserve a star at yelp !
Rebel place is not a place for you .
It was not for me .
They do not provide a nice living environment ( never ) .
They do not listen to you if you complain .
They never gave me a notice for new roommates moving in , they did not get any approval from me .
Oh the management said they can not guarantee tenant 's safety .
The shuttle schedule does not work all the time .
They change schedule just because they want to ( they do not consider students ) .
This is not just my story .
I am 20 years old started building by getting a car from drive time , a year ago i got the mazda 3 2011 , now i want into cardinale way not knowing what i was doing all on my own , but thank god for jason and cj for making everything work out for me , dropped my interest rate when drive time had fucked me over .
However i assume it was full of people who wanted to try this place for the first time , so i am not expecting the full seated load to last .
The food is not the same as at the other two locations .
Greens were not seasoned , i was given well undercooked sweet potatoes , catfish was just ok .
I probably will not be going there for vietnamese any more , as there other great places for the same price .
The eggs i got at the express airport version were not at all the same i get in the restaurant .
I ordered a lemonade and was given no choice in size .
Sometimes the food 's great and at times it s not at all what i expected .
I would not even give this place 1 star .
My main reason for this horrible rating is because services was that bad , and the food did not make it any better .
The lobsters were the small ones and the fish were fillet , at least no bones .
No biggie , $ 30 and it 's done .
I really did not think i 'd have to bring a tool set just to get a decent used vehicle from a respected dealership , guess i was wrong .
So i attempted to contact the sales manager as well as the general manager via email ... no response .
All i was hoping for was for them to make things right and fix the gasket so i did not have to .
Apparently once you have bought one of their vehicles with a sham inspection though , they have no need to help you out any longer .
So i thought , maybe their emails are not working ?
Long story short ... do not buy , especially used , from cardinale way mazda mesa .
Do not judge .
It 's a better alternative , i am not starving myself in the name of food .
Anyways , at baro the food was still so good so i can not imagine how much better it would be with a smaller group
Can not think of a better steakhouse and value for your money .
Ugh ... why did not i just check yelp first ?
In this vulnerable state i found myself wandering over to lolo's and it 's just not good .
I have had chicken and waffles in about 10 states and never had it this poorly seasoned .
I can not be happier with the replacements that were made to my vehicle - every penny is worth it when you are customer at kinkades .
Wow me encanto el restaurante y la atencion al cliente el pastel de tres leches no lo recomiendo mucho .
I have never had bad service and we have been there many many times .
They were warning us about the 2 hour limit from the beginning but luckily they were not hounding us about it near the end ( we had some late arrivals ) .
Firstly , nice decor inside and food was not bad , but for a price of $ 40 ( friday dinner ) , it did not live up to it s price tag .
I would not return here because they did not have anything special on their menu that was particularly delicious .
The portion size was very small too and it was not anything extraordinary .
I will never go spent my money here again !
I will never be back to this sierra gold again .
If that was not worrisome enough , i went to a closer dealership for my first oil change ( which was supposed to be covered in my warranty ) and i found out , not only was it not covered , someone had entered it in the computer wrong .
Left a message , never heard back .
The waffles were limp , not crispy .
Nope , will not go back .
Times like this i wish i were blind or poorly sighted ... this place looks worse than a hole in the wall ... smells " special " when you walk in and honestly ... if city inspectors are not retardo .. this place i think would definately be closed down .
Not sure i can handle the sight of this place ... maybe i am just a snob ... :(
Will never buy a cat from them again .
I wish i could say it has gotten better ... alas it has not .
Management has no respect for its current residents and main priority is to recruit new victims .
Do not be fooled it as far from " student living " as it could be .
Not even kidding .
I did not know that this was a large sandwich chain like subway or jersey mike 's .
The sauce was excellent and had spices that i really could not identify .
Also an apartment should not be without a fire extinguisher what if the apartment caught fire within those 2 days they would try and blame ya when it was there fault for taking the fire extinguishers out of our apartments they should have sent someone up to inspect them then should have never had to leave our apartment .
All in all , rebel place is a shitty place to live and the employees downstairs are all rude ass fuck and do not care about nothing but trying to get every dime you have to your name .
I love it so much so affordable and fast no having to wait long for you food it s worth every penny
As a single 22 year old female with no automotive repair experience whatsoever , he could have easily tried to be deceptive .
If you do not want to line up for phoenix , kitchen m is your next option !
The only thing that i would say do not order from there is their ramen .
I appreciate that they offer something different but ramen is just not their thing .
The soup base was weird and their noodles was not the typical ramen .
It 's always chaos in there but the servers never mess up and never long wait on food .
We decided to go to tr because we had not eaten all day ... but we would have been better off not doing that .
My husband and son would not finish their burgers , they said the rolls were stale and the beef was mushy .
I ordered the salad with chicken but it was so overwhelmed with cheese that i could only eat about a third because you could not taste the egg , tomato , lettuce etc .
I have not had any direct issues with security but i have seen many other residents have this problem .
They also do not clean the units before you move in , if they say they do they are surely lying .
All in all , the convenience of roommate matching , pricing and their student friendly amenities make it livable , but i would not recommend them to anyone who makes a decent living .
Still bitter they did not honor the free drink because i was two seconds too late .
Order in the order line , pay in the pay line ... you would think its obvious but no joke people were waiting 10 people ahead before learning they were in the wrong line .
I just went there for an oil change and i was not pressured or sold on other things , which is nice !
Everything else we ordered ( 2 types of ceviche , " big ass steak " , and a whole bunch of other things i can not remember ) was unremarkable .
Would not go back .
Came in to check on my ac to see why it was not blowing very cold .
Long delays in service meant that we had to get up and find waitstaff ( can not just flag them in a private room ) to ask that plates be cleared , and so forth .
Poor service should deter prospective diners , but if you do decide to eat here know that this is not chinese food but american chinese food , characterized by fried meats and sweet sauces .
We ordered the spicy broth - one 3 spice level and the other 2 . the 3 spice level was too spicy we can not take it .
Judging by the number of kids it 's family friendly but i would not take small kids .
I do not think there is anything to write about and i need not bother since most of the reviews here do it justice .
Shameful characteristics that just never go away : sticky tables ( even sticky sugar spouts ! ) , dirty bathroom , dry food stuck on cutlery , zero service , customer berating * customer berating - you do not have to bark at me twice that if i pay by card i need to go to the counter .
Shameful characteristics that just never go away : sticky tables ( even sticky sugar spouts ! ) , dirty bathroom , dry food stuck on cutlery , zero service , customer berating * customer berating - you do not have to bark at me twice that if i pay by card i need to go to the counter .
Customer service advice : do not try to grab my credit card out of my hand .
If tapping card does not have tip settings set up , do not get frustrated at me and tell me that you ca n't receive a tip because i did n't insert card for the tip option .
But it ai not my fault you were too gutless to follow - through and agree with my suggestion and only say to me " next time , bring cash " .
This place is lolo 's in name only , the food is like all airport food , over priced and not very good .
I continue to go to the central location but will not go to the airport .
Finally got to try it , was not disappointed .
Shrimp ceviche , og duck chaufa ( which is ammmmaazinngg ) , my drink was great ( though i can not remember the name of it ) and even though i was so full and did not want desert , i could not help but finish the churros suggested to us .
Not sure if seating for 2 has that many options ( we were seated at the kitchen bar , but we did not see any other small tables on the first floor ) .
Do not get it .
Neither will they when business does not support the high rent here .
Good luck will not be back .
He told me they had a new radiator ordered and i could pick it up later in the day no charge .
You can not buy this kind of honesty anywhere in this town , let alone , from an auto repair shop .
It just does not get much better .
We do not see many asians there because they do not exist in madison but i can tell they are in the kitchen .
I do really like they are spicy eggplant , but not the orange chicken .
The calamari was so stringy that i had to swallow it in one bite because i could not separate it with my teeth .
The egg rolls were at least crispy and well - rolled , but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt .
By this time , i drank my half glass of water - and she did not even bother to top mine off .
They are not the least bit accommodating , and do not do there job .
I can not tell you how many times i have had to go up to the office again and again due to mistakes on there part .
If you do not mash well .
Not to mention how bad the neighborhood is !
The rooms are small , the furniture is crap , the apartments are ridiculously overpriced , ( $ 600 + per room for a two bedroom apt when you can get your own apt for that ) and the place was not even clean when i or my roommates moved in .
Do not get roped into living here !!!!
Atmosphere is comfortable - do not come in your sweats if you do not want to feel out of place , but i do not think they 'd turn you away .
I would have gave it 5 stars if the turkey was hot , cranberry sauce was room temp , not cold and serving it with gravy on the side winnah , winnah , turkey dinnah !!
So bring your appetite because this 20 " is no joke , even with two people trying to finish it
They did not seat us until after i complained loudly to the manager on duty .
I will not come back again and i do not recommend this place just because of the lousy service .
The food was delicious and satisfying but the portions were not overly large .
Most people cleaned their plates completely and did not take home leftovers ( we ordered lots of starters and also dinner for each of us ) .
I suppose this is where the lack of service comes in -- if you do not ask for it , the waitresses might even ignore you !
There clearly was not any need .
The guy who came to the desk did not look for any appointment book .
I 'd most likely return , just not on my lunch break .
Will not renew my lease and would not recommend living here to anyone .
People constantly digging in the trash and maintenance does not clean up the property .
2 . the servers are not trained properly - our waitress did not know that certain drinks came without alcohol until i pointed out the fine print on the menu ( which she did not even read ) and she thought that all tables came with chips & guacamole , when in fact , they were not free .
She also did not make helpful recommendations on menu items - when asked , everything was delicious .. so it did not really help me make up my mind .
She also did not make helpful recommendations on menu items - when asked , everything was delicious .. so it did not really help me make up my mind .
Unfortunately , it tasted like it was braised in soy sauce , and the meat was not tender , but instead extremely dry .
This place has potential - but it is certainly not there yet .
It was very one - note in flavor : simply no depth .
I left tasting onions for a long time - not good .
My husband felt the oysters were just not the right texture in this dish .
What 's not to love .
And unfortunately the food did not not taste good .
It was not fresh ( the veges were transparent and limp ) and the food was flavorless .
I read some of the previous reviews about people inside the kitchen not wearing anything to catch hair ... yesterday i observed the kitchen staff and they were all wearing a mix of either hairnets , caps , and bandanas .
I was not impressed with the meat ...
The beef and pork meat were so dry / tough / stale and not tasty .
I have used this shop several times , they know what they are doing , they do not quote you outrageous prices , he is honest and tells you about recalls on your vehicle and saves you money .
I do not even live close to the shop .
Banchan was bean sprouts and kimchi , the kimchi clearly brought in - not fresh and too salty for my liking .
The veggie were very bland , lacking something , and they did not provide ginger with the chinese vinegar , which i really missed .
But one thing to keep in mind is that they do n't take credit card , even though it said that it does on yelp .
Which i find a little ridiculous considering the fact that it was not stated on the menu , also for the price of 30$ / person i think the ice - cream could have been unlimited .
I have come here with my coworkers several times and the service is not great .
No stand outs .
There 's a couple other items which were really smelly too but i can not recall the name .
Amazing first experience , can not wait to come back !
The food however , tastes a little under par ; i have always really liked the variety of wings they have but most of the other menu items for some reason do not quite carry the flavor of other establishments .
The beer is reasonably priced , and you will never have any trouble finding any of the games you are trying to see ; especially since they have tvs imbedded in the mirrors in the bathrooms .
You can really taste the soup flavor in the meat - do not need to dip sauce .
Service could be better but do not expect much .
You can not go wrong with these guys !!
Overall , not the broadest menu selection i have seen but the food is good and it 's convenient if you are at the red rock and do not want to deal with the big lines at the buffet or grand cafe .
I got the deal i wanted , probably not the best deal .
Not for finance issues though .
( this was all because of miscalculation , not my credit ) .
*i have not purchases a mazda before *
Never have i had fried chicken that had absolutely no flavor .
I was utterly amazed to find a place with " chicken " in it s name that did not know how to fry a good chicken .
Not even salt and pepper .
Do they think that phoenix has so many seniors with dead taste buds that no one would notice ?
In the meantime , i say no no to lo lo .
Once i have tasted this dish i never bother ordering it from other places .
Quantity wise it was not good .
The service was not there as we had to get our own cutlery from the front .
Food was not that good either .
The only good thing is that it 's not as crowded as congee wing and congee queen .
I can not count the number of times i have gone this restaurant but it 's been since they opened .
During those times , i would say i pretty much never really had any issues .
I knew what to expect in asian places in toronto ... you will not get good service but most of the time , the food is great .
Food was quick ... mine not so pretty tho .
I do not think i can say enough nice things about them .
Parking is tight so do not get all mr .
Dry and super salty , just the way i do not like it .
At least 50 % people sitting were not playing .
The bread was soft -- like slightly microwaved - soft ( not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing . )
I was expecting the proportion to be more like 2/3 pastrami and 1 / 3 cold slaw , with the pastrami over - flowing and hanging over the sandwich -- but it was not .
Because of the proportion , the sandwich did not scream out " pastrami " in my mouth .
In conclusion , the sandwich did not lived up to its name .
I probably would not come back for their capastrami .
** overall , the sandwich did not impress me , but it was not bad either .
The sambar lentil soup was good and not too spicy .
I tried the mutton sukka masala ( sp ? ) was so good and not too spicy .
We walked in intending for a quick late dinner but did not even stay to eat or even takeout .
I will not be coming back !
Did not even get a real piece ... for $ 7 , lolo you can do better .
Do not buy from this dealership !!!!!
My husband and i had just had our 3rd baby and our nissan versa was not cutting it size wise .
In the last 12 months we have had at least $ 4000 in repairs and it 's not over !
A list of things that have gone wrong : in 12 months replacement of ac compressor , alternator , battery , tires need replacing , bad automatic doors , power steering , and now some kind of electrical problem no one seems to be sure of .
I really wanted to like this place and for it to be " our place " to buy cars but that just was not the case .
I am an out of state student so courtney explained that they were able to decrease my rent pricing if i were to not be present longer than 1 month ( but was not true when i inquired leaving back home for 3 months later in the summer - courtney lied ) .
During our tour process our leasing agent did not explain that to us at all .
After every weekend the parking lot would be trashed ( not blaming the mess on rebel place ) but i am blaming them for not doing anything about the situation in the first place .
They know that it is a college environment but they never thought to have better security or system of controlling the residential area .
The wifi and service sucked , there were numerous times the internet would shut down and not work within the next 24 hours .
The mildew in the sink was so bad that through out the entire year i have put in a request to rebel place , they never came in to service it .
Us cleaning the unit was better than the cleaning job that was done when we moved in so i did not understand why were we being charged the extra cleaning / touch up fee 's .
I called the office to help me understand specifically where in the unit the paint needed to be touched up but the leasing agent was " not able to disclose that information to me . "
I find it weird that they can not tell me what areas in our unit was not in good condition .
Save yourself the headache and do not lease here .
If you are already moved in rp , good luck - be sure to take pictures and record the damages / condition of your apartment for proof because they will not believe you .
I do not think $ 500 + a month is worth it living here .
The best items were the meat , which seemed to be pretty good quality ; the stuffed meatball ( beware of the hot cheese ) ; the shrimp wonton ; the fried mantou ( served hot ! ) with the condensed milk dipping sauce ; and i liked that their taro was in small pieces and pre-fried so it would not take too long to cook .
Though they have a two - hour limit , it was not enforced when we were there , probably because there was not a line when we were eating .
We have never eaten south indian food before and it turns out that whatever we knew from punjabi cuisine does not really apply here beyond the traditional names .
While i do not really blame them , it is something to consider for someone who does not eat spicy on a regular basis .
I started taking my car there after another mechanic did not work out last year .
Yeah , not true .
Ordered bbq pork with rice , half of the meat were full of tendon that i can not even eat it .
In my head i was thinking what are you talking about , but i did not argue with her and just decided not to come back .
I was quite surprised , the food quality was pretty fresh , service was not bad , however some of the servers do not understand english that well but we were able to get a hold off a couple that did understand , and they are very kind and provided great service to us .
One item i do not usually see at hotpot is the cheese beef ball , it tastes as good as it sounds , definitely get an order if you go , you will not regret it .
Everyone gets their own pot , and there are no free standard soup bases , so expect to spend about $ 37 after tax and tip without drinks .
They gave us tofu desert , but it was not that great .
Probably not since i can get better quality hk food nearby .
It 's lively and clean environment , with good ventilation which does not leave you smelling after the meal .
They give you notsk ' snickers when you order your food because you almost could not decide between your family on what to get .
The food for a restaurant is only a small portion - do not forget about service and ambiance / environment !
When i return my wife said they did not have your meal .
I thought wow no i am sorry it s on us for your inconvenience .
No i waited 10 more minutes .
I regret i moved here from ca to goto unlv , i did not have any family or friends to show me the ropes .
Not to mention the walls are so thin you can hear other people poop and pee .
Signed , a current resident that can not wait to get out .
I would rather go elsewhere and pay less for the same food .. service was not that great either .. but i see these rich asian kids pulling up in exotic cars all the time with a few girls and they all seem to think the food is amazing lol place did a good job marketing !
All my wealthy asian friends seems to want to check his place out and they always suggest this place for hot pot .. in my opinion , home - made hot pot is the best , unless if a restaurant has something unique and / or special , which this place does not ..
Not greasy and the noodles were a nice size !
For a basket of dumplings for $ 6 - 7 on average , you can not beat a classic in both flavour and value .
Ok the story is we tried to book a table for 930 pm and were told that it will not take long if we just show up at the store .
Since there 's usually not many large groups at that time , therefore a reservation is not necessary .
We were not seated until waiting for 1.5 hrs .
The service is always fast and friendly and the food never dissapoints .
I have no idea how garbage tastes like , but i am pretty sure if anything , i got a good idea of it from their side of vegetables .
You unlock a door not knowing who is behind .
The halls are not cleaned .
I did not even ask for one .
Do not miss this hidden jewel !
Because i am not really like cold noodle .
Not too spicy , but very flavorful and savory .
And can easily be driven by if you are not paying attention !
I love this place and can not think of a better value for one of my favourite things to eat in the whole world .
I have to admit that we do not order the korean food as much since i am too busy stuffing my face with dumplings .
Here are some tips that i have learned in the many many times that i have eaten here . this place does take reservations so do not hesitate to call .
This is especially advisable if you have a large party since they do not really have that many tables that can seat 8 or more .
Do not be afraid to stick - your - hand - up - in - the - air like grade school to get their attention .
Nothing is more disappointing than being ready to eat and finding out that they will not be back for another month .
In general , their staff was friendly , direct , and did not push any last - minute deals on me , no deceptive sales tactics .
( as for the reviews below ... i do not know why they had such a bad time , but if you look at other sites you will see that cardinale way is the top - reviewed dealership , so do not let it skew your opinion too much )
If you do not know the ingredients they will explain it to you properly .
It is not like a typical sub place , the sizes for sandwiches go from 9 " , 12 " , to 20 " .
Good quality , not horrible , not amazing , but good .
The only down side to this place is that their cha gio , vietnamese spring roll , is good but not the best .
So ... why not 5 - stars .. becuase i have eaten at better vietnamese restaurants in la , but this is number one on my list , in to .
I did not give them the five star because they only have one kind of bread which is white bread .
Do n't do business with them .
I am not sure why i have never been here before .
Nice and light , not heavy at all .
They said they could do nothing to help me out and the security guard , which is ether sitting in his car or on his phone said he did not see anything .
Turkey , gravy , & stuffing in a delicious roll [ it comes with cranberry sauce , but i am not a big fan of any cranberry sauce on my turkey ] .
The red rock location , for some reason , does not offer large sandwiches .
I can not stop thinking about the delicious food i had for dinner last night , which prompted me to write my first yelp review .
Anyways , i can not wait to go back to try their pho and banh xeo !
I do not really have high expectation for hong kong style cafe as i just want something fast , affordable and a menu with varieties .
The food here is not amazing but will do the job if you are in the area .
They have never been spectacular but they were always okay .
Walked around a bit with my wife and daughter and came back after 20 minutes .... not ready yet .
The girl behind the counter could not be bothered to listen and walked into the kitchen .
He finally came out and was no help .
No compensation or anything resembling a sincere apology never going back to this bunch of losers and will tell all my friends to stay away as well .
We kept ordering and the food kept not coming .
We told him that half the food we ordered never came and we kept reminding various servers .
Most servers did not know what they are doing .
On a side note , i have never been to this plaza , there is a nice and quiet t&t supermarket there which i will visit again .
The restaurant is not busy and they still forgot our order .
We have been to other pts and sierra's and have never experienced bad service like this .
Javier rarely came around to our side of the bar .... and when he did i ordered a pinot grigio ... he left and never came back !
Do not miss the biscuits .
Service is not ideal , decor is not exactly luxurious and up - scale , i am really selling this are not i ?
The steamed dumplings contents within are flavorful but not overpowering , the skin is just the right thickness , and coming out of the stove at the right time , it makes any living being salivate .
Worst case is you do n`t like it , but it definitely does not make a dent in your wallet .
So why not give a safe bet a chance ?
It 's not s. phoenix .
It 's not scottsdale .
If you reduce your expectations accordingly , it 's not bad .
The lil jay , eggs and waffle for six bucks , is not a bad deal for an airport .
No individualized seating area .
Not sure what they did to it , but it was sweet , crispy , chewy , moist and perfectly caramelized on the outside .
And not only was the chicken good , but the collards it came with were amazing too : tender and sweet , with some smokiness from the ham .
Perlou was spicy and crunchy , but really you could not tell there was fish in there .
Not too sweet , rich , creamy and with a perfectly crunchy crust .
We were not very successful .
Everything i have had here has been tasty , and everything is so inexpensive ( an odd thing is that one time i ordered a bibimbap and they placed the veggies at the bottom of the stone pot and it ended up burning , i am not sure if this was just a one time mistake , or if they just do not know how to make bibimbap in a hot stone bowl ) .
The interior is not the nicest , and the service is not spectacular but that 's to be expected from a typical chinese restaurant .
No complaints here !
I did not see the appeal in the fried buns with condensed milk that everyone else does ... the buns were kind of cold and hard .. maybe they were old since it was around 9 pm when we got them .
Although it is a little pricey , i do not mind spending a little more once in a while for good hot pot .
The menu description says it comes with raw honey , which i did not see - maybe it was incorporated into the butter but if so not in any discernible quantity .
We finished off the meal with a slice of buttermilk pie with lemon curd - which featured a nice heavy custard weaved through with not - too - tart - not - too - sweet lemon curd .
Not bad at all .
No other orders besides ours and the one in front of us came out .
Another 10 min later it was still not ready and we had to catch our flight so i asked for some kind of compensation and they told me i could not have any kind of refund but i could have 2 containers of gummy bears .
It makes me really upset to have to write this follow up review , but in light of recent events my opinion of this dealership has completely changed , and i no longer feel comfortable recommending this place .
Apparently they never did this , and this entire time i have owned be car ( 8 months now ) the dealership has never contacted or notified me that this debit never occurred .
On top of everything , it is now 2 weeks later since having recieved this letter , and absolutely no one from the dealership has contacted me back to resolve this matter .
I have left a voicemail with accounts receivable , left my issue on their facebook page ( to which someone commented , but they never actually called me to resolve the issue like they said they would ) and i even called and spoke with their gm ( who said he would get right on the issue and would call me back - it 's now a week and a half later and nothing ) .
Apparently no one at this dealership feels the need to be accountable for their customer 's experience once they have sold them the car .
I will not be returning to this dealership with my business , nor will i ever recommend them again .
They allowed us to make a reservation , even though we were one person short of their 6 - person minimum ; they had a high chair ready at our table without us having to ask ; the server was super sweet and interactive with our 9 - month - old daughter ; they brought our food promptly even though they were super busy ; and the noise level in the restaurant was high enough that her occasional shrieks did not appear to bother any of the the other diners .
I will not go in that office because every time i do nothing gets solved because she does not care and acts like you are the dumb one and it s your fault .
Maintenance was aware that it would leak down into her room but did not think that they should notify us at all .
And she told maintenance she would not sleep here until they could tell her whether there 's mold or not .
They never came back until we emailed them 5 times about the situation .
So not only was my roomate paying for a room she could not sleep in they are knowingly putting our health at risk .
Tried to make delivery over the phone , girl could not understand me when giving my address .
Eric was a no pressure salesmen and chris finalized a " no nonsense deal " thanks guys !
Do not confuse this with the one on the east side of madison .
But the thing is .... i can not even remember what i ordered .
I tried pouring in about a gallon of soy sauce , but no dice .
It was a meal that i hardly ate and 30 minutes that i will never get back .
I do not think i will go here again when i am down visiting my dad .
Cons : sometimes slow to distribute mail , no turf for animals so the hallways always smell like urine , back parking lot usually has a lot of trash , sometimes they will not call to tell you that you have a package waiting in the office .
I have never seen an apartment staff handle issues with tenants more poorly .
Do not live here .
Do n't come here , if you want to be discriminated for being gay !
Full cock fest of straight men , what i did not expect is when the group of guys kept point & laughing at me and my man .
You obviously do not care about your guests our your life .
Not anymore , i am telling everybody not to come , specifically not this location .
The menu had a great selection and it is not your typical bar food .
Can not wait to go back again !
If you are staying at the boulders i am guessing that the price of food is not an object .
Probably can not afford to go to these places .
This area scottsdale , carefree , and old town cave creek in not for a person on a beer budget it is pricey ... might be too pricey for a beer budget $ 5.00 / bottle for domestic beer .
But for the price you pay , you should not be expecting any less .
I am not a huge fan of the individual personal pots because hot pot is always a big group activity kind of thing for me .
No server approached us , and the manager was just shooting the breeze with his obvious buddies .
We will not be back .
The coleslaw sets the sandwich apart leaving you feeling not so badly about the deeeeelish pastrami .
Most locals think it 's far , but actually not a bad drive at all .
The portions were big well at least to me so i did not finish it all and i was sharing with my husband .
He is not a big drinker , but he enjoyed the drink .
I had it last time i was here but could not remember the name so i could not order it ! " he , he . felt a little sorry for him but just a little .
Salad was fresh and the burger was not a thin patty .
Not too shabby .
Second visit included my six year old which was not so good , they do not even have crayons for a child .
The food was also incredible - our server suggested 3 to 5 dishes , and we ordered 5 , which for two people was a lot , but i had no regrets .
If you have not , let me tell about the french toast i consumed on my last visit . for $ 4.95 , imagine a melted layer of peanut butter -y goodness sandwiched between two slices of crustless , brick toast .
This decadent snack is not for the faint of heart ( or for those at risk for diabetes ) .
Also , the wifi is not very reliable .
Not only because it brings back memories of childhood but also because southern food is always filling and comforting , with it s generous helpings of butter , meat , and flavor .
The menu was not the largest , but it seemed to focus on the southern food of the eastern seaboard - influences of virginia down to south carolina with its confluence of seafood and meats .
In hindsight , i have come to the conclusion that hip ( ster ) and southern do not mix .
Not to say that southern food is not laborious - the labor is totally dedicated to making the food as delicious and fulfilling as possible .
Furthermore , the picked potato makes no sense next to the crab cake ( yes , singular cake ) .
The vegetables in the shrimp and grits were cooked separately and not enough , and as a result there really was not a mingling of flavor between the shrimp , grits , and vegetables .
Finally , their spiked sweet tea was not sweet even by normal american standards , let alone the very sweet sweet teas of the south .
But this meal was ultimately disappointing because you can not be hip and ironic while at the same time be true to a southern mentality .
I do not recommend coming here for southern food because it 's not real southern food .
They are not your run of the mill cheap chinese chain nor do they offer the more daring , traditional style cuisine that some of the smaller places in town now do and can take a bit more courage .
The decrease in lights , residence on property , and cars in the parking lot gives away the fact that not a lot of residence are home during these times .
Do not expect the service to be amazing .
They are not fancy steaks , but i do not really care for super fancy steaks .
If i am in the mood for some high protein meals that will not really send me in the poorhouse , i will come here .
Just an update so do not expect a whole tapestry .
I do not know what was in the water that made these ladies snappy and rude but that day , they were very rude when getting the bill for us .
I know i do not usually incorporate service into chinese places but there is a minimum , and the minimum is human decency and basic respect .
I do not appreciate the cut-eyes , ???
I reached out to mazda corporate regarding the lack of resolution from the dealer and during a conference call between me , mazda corporate , and the dealer service manager , jerry , things got a little heated although no vulgarity or name calling was used in any way .
I do not think they want to deal with the problem because they 'd rather pass the buck .
And i certainly do not want to waste my time on a dealership that is not willing to fix a practically brand new vehicle .
Definitely do not recommend this dealership to anyone .
No more .
The restaurant itself is on the dark side with lots of wood and not much lighting , but it 's not unwelcoming by any means .
There are big screen tv 's to watch the games , but they are not overpowering if you just want to sit and dine .
( we went around 6 pm , so i am not sure how this changes as it gets later ) .
We would order some things again , and probably not order others - but everything was fresh , homemade , and unique !
The menu is not huge but allows for a lot of customization .
The queso was on - point with taste , and was definitely homemade and not from a can !
We would probably not order it again .
Again , we would probably not order them but more because of personal taste .
Multiple servers brought our meals , cleaned up dishes , etc. the manager / owner ( not sure ) stopped by every table to thank us for visiting and ask how our meals were .
Our server was quick with refills , the check , etc , but we never felt rushed .
Even the food that we did not love , was still made well and with fresh ingredients .
Waitress took exceptionally long to get to table after we were seated , we requested a table and i have to admit that we received one , however it was so small that with the peanut buckets , menus , and all the advertising , condiments , etc there really was no room for food one the drinks were brought .
Order was taken , salads brought were not only not as ordered but wrong dressing on both .
Finished salad only to have yet another server bring out 2 entrees that we did not order .
Correct order finally arrives with no place on table to put them as the tiny table had not been cleared of salad plates .
I believe if they had only one person waiting a table the mix ups would not occur .
We had at least 4 different servers and i do not believe any of them were communicating with each other which is why so many mix ups occurred .
However the dam waitress would not stop texting on her cell phone the entire time in the dining room in plain view of the 5 customers that were in there .
So we were sitting there with empty glasses and could not get our drinks refilled and when we did manage to finally get her attention she seemed pissed and discombobulated that we interupted her texting session .
I was always under the impression that the customer was supposed to be # 1 not the cell phone / computer .
We will never return due to the extreme lack of customer service knowledge on managements part and front line staff .
Quickly dealt with , but check your bill i live down the road so it 's not a big deal for me , but for gods sake do not drive from anywhere south of 101 .
Cave creek and carefree have lots of great fun restaurants unique to the town atmosphere , this is not one of them .
Just not a lot of days .
I was super excited to have some southern food as i have not been impressed with any other place in town .
I thought it lacked flavor , would not order that again .
The perlou was very tasty - would not recommend if you do not like spicy as it does have a kick .
I went on a late week day night so there was not a wait to get a table .
They do have quite a few different type of soup bases that are not seen in other hot pot places which is nice but then they do charge a premium for them .
I do not understand that for an all you can eat place .
Over the phone the term professional does not exist .
I would never consider giving them my hard earned money .
Soup not salty , but lacked depth .
I came here with a friend on a saturday evening , at 5:30 pm , as they do not take reservations for 2 . the restaurant was already pretty full .
When our soup bases arrived , our hot plates were not turned on ... nor were we offered any assistance .
There are different prices depending on the soup base , which i have not encountered before at other hot pot restaurants so - 0.5 star for that .
For a two person table , we were not allowed to order the split soup base ... sure , ok ... they should list that in the menu then .
I would come back here when i am really hungry and not catching up with a friend , because we certainly did not get our money 's worth ( $ 27.99 plus tax on weekend ) ...
Spent a lot of time chatting , and not enough eating !!
I order mango lassi too but was nt that good ... smthg was missing .. overall , the service and food was good not excellent !!
Food is good but the place is not cozy .
I would not ever recommend somebody to live here !
They do not inform you when somebody is moving in , they have so many hidden fees that they will find to charge you with , they have random people walking around that do not live there and my own safety was at risk ; which management did nothing about .
Not fair , not clean , not a place to want to live ever !
Everything else we got was really good too , not a single complaint .
Ordered a pitcher of watermelon juice that was supposed to be shared between 3 - 4 people ...... not sure how much 3 - 4 people would get as it was just a tall cup that they called a ' pitcher ' .
Menu is a little difficult if you do not know the cuisine already .
The service is not friendly but typical for type of cuisine , so neither plus nor minus .
Not my usual preference but will come back when in the mood .
I had to meet someone for lunch in west toronto near 401 , and had no idea where to go .
At least , that was my take on it , but i am no expert on viet food , yet !
The server asked me to check doneness before leaving and will replace your steak if it 's not done right ( the table next to mine had that problem ) .
There were not too much peanut shells on the floor as the other tr i have been to in the south but i tell you what , the food tastes the same .
To give you a few examples i had to keep reordering the same items because it never came , the orders never come in full and always have missing items , the empty plates are left on the table and sat there for the whole duration of the meal , the server would acknowledge you but walk away from your order .
I am not sure if it 's coincidental but it makes one doubt that action .
I really do not see what they are trying to sell you .
I would expect a certain level of quality with the ingredients but i guess it could not be bothered .
It is evident that i can not recommend this place .
My sales person ( chris johnson ) was very responsive to my emails and did not seem " pushy " at all .
When i came in to sign the paperwork i did not have to wait more than a few minutes before we got started .
One thing i did not like was the guy i had to see after my salesperson , to talk about extended warranty , scratch protection , etc .
He was a bit pushy and rude , did not like him very much .
Ever. my service guy ( nick ) is always upbeat and friendly , i never have to wait even 1 second to go see him when i come in for service .
In life in general , i do not particularly like car dealerships , but as far as dealerships go cardinaleway mazda deserves 5 stars , especially for their service department which is outstanding .
Their pho was actually not bad .
Food does not taste the same .
Pot stickers were defiantly bought not freshly made .
We will never eat here again .
Spent nearly $ 75 and it simply was not worth it .
Definitely not worth $ 2 a piece .
I did not taste sweet on those ribs .
The portion appeared to be child - sized or maybe a half portion but it was most definitely not worth almost $ 16 . the beef and broccoli was supposed to be prepared in a garlic brown sauce ( according to the menu ) .
The sauce had a light reddish tinge ( maybe from some tomato sauce ? ) and there was no garlic flavor in this sauce .
Additionally , i was not given ( or offered ) any packets of soy sauce ( or any other sauce ) or chopsticks .
I would not order takeout from this place again much less actually go and eat there .
Did not eat .
Sent corporate 2 emails - they never responded .
Smh will not go back .
Service is not to the same standard as the other locations .
" no , we do not have honey ...? " . the also - frustrated patron behind me said " you have cornbread , how do you not have honey ? " an employee lingering near the counter / employee door said rudely " who puts honey on cornbread ! ? "
" no , we do not have honey ...? " . the also - frustrated patron behind me said " you have cornbread , how do you not have honey ? " an employee lingering near the counter / employee door said rudely " who puts honey on cornbread ! ? "
( he may have not been a lolo 's employee , his black hat and shirt had white logos .
Clearly lolo 's management did not mid him being there ) the joes bbq looks to be a faster alternative .
I was not in a big hurry to board my plane home so i decided to try this instead of the barbecue place next door .
The counter clerk came out and called for another name repeatedly but it was not mine .
Finally i realized that my plane was going to board in 15 minutes and i still had to clear security and had no food .
I walked up to the counter and asked if my food was ever going to be ready and the clerk told me it had been ready and why had not i come and gotten it .
I told her they never called my name and she blamed the cook in back .
She could have tapped me on the shoulder or called out what the order was but she did not .
I did not have time to complain to the manager , but i somehow suspect they would not have cared either .
Avoid if you do not want crappy customer service .
The pork filling was not excessively fatty and there was a lot of it !
Oh , i ordered the pork bone soup before , and it was not my favourite .
Not terrible but there is room for improvement .
Not like , " less than a full drink to allow the ice to melt " , but a solid two or three sips worth .
Drink was not comped , was not offered an apology .
I am not a fan of rice , but this was the best fried rice i have ever had in a chinese restaurant .
These could not have been any more perfect .
I do not know .
But i have a feeling that this infatuation will not be ending anytime soon .
I was excited to see an all - day breakfast section ( because come on , it 's never the wrong time for sausage and eggs ) , but that quickly changed when i realized that there were only two items in that section .
The curry was tasty , but i did not have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent .
The service itself was not the greatest .
The restaurant was not packed by any means , but the waitresses did not seem very attentive to our needs .
This place is definitely not student living , they will take anyone who offers to pay up .
If they did not lock you in with the lease i 'd say you 'd be better off staying at siegel suites for almost half the price !
They did not come fix it today so i have sleep in heat thanks rebel place .
I was a bit surprised that when we ordered the items did not come out together .
No one came back to take a food order .
No one stopped by to see how i was doing .
Do not think i will come back .
Can not wait for the summer to chill in the courtyard .
There was no ventilation and had very little / no air conditioning .
They were meaty , juicy , and skin was perfectly thin - spring pancake - a little too doughy and not enough onions or other fillings / toppings - sparerib in sweet & sour sauce - sweet , tangy , and crispy !
Other items were average and i would not recommend them .
For dining in , the food is usually pretty good but the service is extremely casual and slow - and there is a major language barrier as english is not the first language of any of the employees .
The last two times , we ordered delivery and had such a poor experience that i will never patronize this establishment again .
We said ok since we did not want to wait and figured it would be easier to make our own rice .
I asked if we needed anything to get the credit and she said no , it would be in their system .
The next time we called , we asked about the credit and they had no record of it ( and did not honor it ) , even though they were able to pull our name and address info up with our phone number .
The food was quite dry and fairly cold , but my expectations for delivery are never very high .
I was disappointed as i figured that at least that would be good ( and i do not care for wonton soup ) , so i called to tell them .
I have never ordered wonton soup in my life . "
And , the last time we ordered from you , you also made a mistake and ... " she then cuts me off " well see , it is your fault then , it is your husband if this happened twice , and i can not take responsibility for that ! "
There 's no way that 's our fault . " so this bickering goes on for several minutes until i finally say , " so are you saying you are not going to take responsibility for this ? " and she responds , " no , i am not going to take responsibility . " and i say , fine , i will never order from you you again . " and she actually replies with " fine . " and then we both hang up !

Let me just say here , i am not a difficult customer .
But i have never in my 38 years been treated so poorly by someone who is in the service industry .
I did not get her name , but i can avow , i will never eat at china tango again .
Everything is prepared well and i have never had concerns from any of my colleagues and friends .
I do not take writing poor reviews lightly , but this was an absolute disaster .
It was a dry ( no sauce - and i mean none ) breast of chicken sliced into strips with about 10 sesame seeds on it .
No apologies .
No apology or any type of compensation .
Any goodwill gesture would have been appreciate as i have eaten sesame chicken at dozens of restaurants and never has it looked like dry sawdust chicken fingers .
We will not be back .
The banh xeo here is pretty authentic , it came with lots of greens on the side including even some herbs that i did not recognize but that my bf and his dad recognized ( they are viet ) .
It came with square chunks of blood ( blood jello ? ) which does not always come with it at other restos .
I did not realize they switched to no one under 21 till i walked in with my kids for dinner and was told that we had to leave !
No sign posted anywhere !
They have great food here and i will never go back because the obvious did not care about local families when the decided to allow smoking !
It still did not come .
We nicely asked for it again and again and still they never came .
We did not have any dipping sauce yet food was still come out .
Service is rather rude and do not really care about helping you out .
I do not think i will be coming back .
Not horrible , but just not something that would bring me back .
Can not say enough good about this place !
I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
I can not wait to go back .
I do not think i have ever seen it really packed .
The bun claimed to be authentic but it was not the steak did not have that flavorful taste like from pop 's or geri 's .
Mmmmm , so my first time in a high end pt's was not what i expected but i m sure i will give it another chance to see if i can get wow 'd .
I guess it did not help that it was raining that night .
I took a look at the prices and they are honestly not all that cheap like what the other reviewers claimed , considering i have tried other places for about the same price and overall experience was much better .
The beef noodle soup came in a pretty large bowl ( could feed 2 ) but noodles had a very mild chlorine taste and soup was too merky for my liking , not to mention that there were only 5 small pieces of beef on top .
The price is the same as authentic korean restaurants , so it was not cheap for something that was so flavourless , and presentation was just awful .
Not to mention , we did not get any korean side dishes .
The soup was not flavourful , the bean sprouts were literally all over the place making the dish super messy and the pork bones were not marinated through as it did not have a strong spicy taste .
Yes , they give you a lot of pieces of meat but it was just a huge mess , very hard to eat , and not authentic whatsoever .
The dumplings came after and i hoped it was better but it did not taste good either .
And the moment we left the store , the owners closed all the lights and did not even clean our table - probably left it for clean up tomorrow .
Although we were not like rushed or anything , do not expect any sort of customer service here .
I do not suggest coming here for their korean pork bone soup at all either because it does not taste authentic as the owners are mandarin .
All in all , we have no plans to come back to this place as there are far better dumpling and korean restaurants in close proximity .
Never coming back .
I am not sure if there has been ownership changes , but the last couple of times the customer service has not been great .
The owner / manager ( never really saw before this month ) can be quite rude and does not come to greet you readily .
Not bad for eating at the airport chicken : flavorful and crispy if you are lucky .
Some of the thighs were not as crispy which sucked .
A few items we wanted were not available .
No complaints ( we did not have solver though ;) )
Also had sirloin steak spaghetti , steak is marinated hk style so it does not quite taste like beef anymore , but ok it 's tasty .
My tire pressure light did not turn off after my visit , so after several messages back and forth and him continuously being patient and saying he could check it all i went back and had another great experience with fast and friendly service .
But this kind of health risk should not be tolerated in a restaurant .
The other food and cocktails were ok but definitely not worth returning .
At first i was hesitant to run my credit because of it lowering my score and not having all the specs of the deal in order , but boy did zach deliver .
The rye drink ( rydy ) with sorghum and ginger ... also stellar ( word of caution : the two do not go well together ;) ) the cornbread appetizer was great , maybe not enough for the price , but crispy top and bottom with a hint of sweetness .
I liked the hush puppies , the wife was lukewarm to them , and the fish had not much flavor , although cooked well .
Not an appealing presentation .
It took a while after ordering drink # 1 to find out their signature mezcal was not available .
It took a while after ordering # 2 to find out mezcal # 2 was also not available .
At that point i have no idea what we got for drink attempt # 3 .
Empanadas were cute but small and not particularly flavourful .
The fried fish was not bad , but nothing special .
Did not love the pork belly it was overcooked fatty but too crispy at the same time .
It was not sweet or moist enough .
Even then , they did not even give us the correct cutlery for our meal .
The soups were bland not worth mentioning at all .
After doing the inspection , tj called to let me know the brakes did not need to be replaced just yet but should be done soon .
You also might want to get your paperwork in order instead of canceling someones entry card because they have two out when it was your office that failed to document giving them a new card since the first one did not work .
So they do not come home at 2 am and can not get in .
Oh and if you do not pay a parking fee you have to " sign in " as a visitor . seriously , get over yourself rebel place .
At first we went to another mazda dealer in mesa who also sells fords , but did not like the way we were treated .
Here 's the real kicker , we bought the car on saturday and the following tuesday greg called and asked us if we would get upset if the financing was lowered from 8 % to 6 % apr ... we we nt back to the dealership and it was no trick , the apr was reduced and we were able to shorten the contract terms with very little increase in payment .
What you will get is a banged up car that has no business being at a car dealership .
The pear salad is pretty good except the pears are canned ... but service is generally good and it is very cozy to watch games , and not too smoky .
Waitress was blunt , no smiles , unresponsive , does not acknowledge .
Can not even serve proper authentic vietnamese noodles .
Just do not go ... i do not think i need say more .
Decent , but not up to par for their price point in madison .
The corn bread was fantastic , but the rest of our food did not fair quite so well .
The mac & cheese gratin was good , but not great - a little heavy on the mustard .
All in all , the food was not unpleasant but did not come close to meeting our hopes .
The biscuit was bland and i did not finish it .
I should have known to stop there but i did not and ended up ordering the crab cake .
The crab cake however was extremely under cooked and in all honesty i should have sent it back but i did not .
No. but i do know that because of what happened shortly after dining there that i will not be going back .
I did not like the deserts specially the 3 leches but the rest of the menu is fantastic .
Do not live here .
Do not waste your time or money
The food is pretty good , service is decent but slow but definitely not worth the price they are charging .
Probably never going to come back just because it 's not worth it money wise .
Killer bar set - up too and when the garage door is open to the patio i can not imagine a better place to enjoy madison summer .
Lo - lo 's chicken & waffles is legitimately not a bad pick if you ever find yourself stuck in phx on a layover for whatever reason .
Normally , you would not expect the same level of quality in its airport counterpart .
I would not know , since i have not actually been to the actual place .
I decided to go with the puffs chicken tender basket , since i prefer my chicken boneless , and i was not let down .
One thing i will note is that the sides are really pricey , and as much as i 'd like some greens , i am not paying over $ 5 for a side of greens .
I will not be coming here again .
Can not forget the kool - aid !
The moment i walked in , i was not greeted , so that was the first red flag , they basically looked at me like " what can we do for you " i had to basically say the first word and said it 's just me .
Second the place was somewhat full so i expected that they may not have a table , the hostess did not catch her name but she look to me like she 's foreign like sri lanka or india .
Too bad i did not get to try their food , i am sure it would of been great .
This is not some chinese fastfood joint , which some folks may be used to their prices .
Being located in cave creek / carefree does not give license to overcharge their patrons .
Likely will not be back .
Do not go hungry .
Presentation is awesome , food not so much
First of all , it is not overcrowded like it is at buffalo wild wings on a sunday morning .
They have a few pool tables and a golden tee arcade game if you are not into watching football .
They did not have a whole menu and portions were small .
The food is always spectacular , do not get me wrong .
The service is better this time , at least our waitress did not get our drinks or our food orders wrong .
I get that it 's a sunday afternoon and you are busy , but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers , especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier ( yes i am talking about the hostess ) .
Anyway love the food , but they really need to work on their service ... one of the rare occasions where i had to consider cutting my tip or no tip .
Also they do not give warnings to when they will be doing fire alarms for buildings or high water power cleaning outside of our doors .
Also when you put in a work order for your home ( e.g water leaking from your kitchen sink , ac vent leaking ) the maintenance workers will not come until the following day because they do not deem it as an " emergency . " however , if this service is included in my rent then everything should be deemed as an emergency & should be fixed right away before any damages occur in the apartment complex .
Also management did not print out a copy of my lease ; i had to ask for one .
Most apartment complexes give you a copy of the lease for your personal use and i found it strange that they did not give one without being asked .
Rebel place lures us in with all these benefits but once you are in , you will see that the so called benefits are not even that worth it .
We sat there for over ten minutes , watching the staff walk around , chat and socialize ... and we were not acknowledged again .
No menus , no " i will be right over " ... just a few glances in our general direction but no effort to provide any sort of service .
No one said a word as we got up and walked out .
Someone had their act together tonight , and it was not sierra gold :(
They said it would take 45 minutes ( which did not bother us ) but it took almost 2 hours .
I do not recommend this place to even try to anyone !
I think there is a reason they offer freebie coupons on the flyer even though they are not worth it .
Just to be sure i am not going to pay anything for this inspection until i get a repair .
I emailed cardinaleway mazda peoria ( i know this is not the same one , but it 's owned by the same people . )
I go in with decent expectations knowing they may turn me down for what i want ... but they did not even want to work with me .
The guy pretty much tells me they can not do anything ... at all ... two dealers were able to pull strings and get me within a few hairs length of a deal on other cars including another used and comparable mini which is great ...
This dealer could not get me anything at all ...
They told me at the beginning they had a second buyer lined up , and after a few minutes of talking i could tell they did not want to wheel and deal ...
Seating is a bit tight which does not bother me , but seemed to bother the people beside us ( we overheard them ) .
I am not coming back for sure , to me indian restaurants should not be this expensive as it is nowhere near fine dining experience .
Can not wait to come back : )
The pork chop was fried really well , a nice light batter and not oily at all .
I wish that i had not gone in there with my family this afternoon .
My initial reaction was - cool not dirty at all ..
- ( l ) arge chicken pho ; broth was actually not bad at all but barely any chicken .
7 / 8 wings were not eaten .
I am surely glad i did not get a ( l ) arge bowl , like the waitress told me .
- did not get to pick our own seats ; lady quickly hollered for us to go where she pointed -_- - waiter did not greet us after hollering at us where to sit !
No eye contact at all .. but did however serve us warm tea -- - table of 6 got 2 menus .. okay that 's interesting .
Gosh - when we told her our wings were not good she seemed so defensive .
We will pay for them but remember the wings are not good , too floury and pale in color ! - oh yeah did i mention that they do not know english or even try .
We will pay for them but remember the wings are not good , too floury and pale in color ! - oh yeah did i mention that they do not know english or even try .
She said in a very rude tone " then do not come back if you do not like it . " what ?
Ugh never again will i go back !
We did not have a wait and everyone smiled during our entire service .
I can not recommend kinkade 's enough tj and the team really go above and beyond on customer service , they communicate to you in warm and professional manner .
I always feel like i was never going to be overcharge or be forced to get any unnecessary work done to my car .
I do not mean this to be necessarily negative , but texas roadhouse is not so much a restaurant as it is a human foie gras farm .
But then again , by the time i waddle my texas - sized , stuffed self to my car afterwards , i have to say " never again ! " , but ... by the following week , i get the visions of sugar rolls dancing in my head and then we find ourselves back in line ... other than the dirty , peanutty floors , stressed out staff , earbud - bursting country music , waiting in line in a cramped , claustrophobic hallway to nowhere and terrible margaritas , this place is awesome !
P.s. - please do not come here on your birthday .
I got two baskets of yeast rolls , and i almost did not have enough room for the rest .
The beef was not tender , the soup was bland and not hot .
I do not think even a shun knife would have that cutability to cut it into pieces .
Would we go to a restaurant that serves everything but do not have anything good ?
At first i was hesitant to run my credit because of it lowering my score and not having all the specs of the deal in order first .
You did not .
I will never do business here .
If you are not from china and can not speak mandarin , do not expect to get a table to sit until every chinese has been served .
Waited for 2.5 hours to complain and they kept telling us that it 's too crammed and that there 's no table for us .
It was not busy at all and the girl doing carry out was messing up orders left and right .
Took over an hour for food to arrive and it was not hot - tepid at best .
But we could not eat the salads because we were not given silverware .
Did not come to check on us or the food or get drink refills .
She came back with the check , which had items we ordered but did not receive .
Whether you are checking it out to have some drinks or to have a sitdown meal , you just can not go wrong .
The craft cocktails are very exceptional ( a telltale sign of the perfect julep is crushed ice , and they do not disappoint ) and the list is classy and perfected .
I am a huge fan of anywhere that offers small plates , both because i tend to have an " eyes are bigger than my stomach " appetite and also i love to expand my horizons and try many things instead of just one ; they do not disappoint on their small plate options .
Vegetables were clean , dressing was perfect and the noodles well separated , i.e. did not arrive in a clump .
They have one of the best ranch salad dressings ever and i never skip that as my side !
I will not go into detail but it 's pretty bad .
I had never heard of lo lo ' , but everyone has heard the term chicken and waffles .
Updating my review again to reflect the change in management , they have increased the price of their lunch special with chow mein from $ 7 to $ 9 which no longer makes lunch a good deal , but merely an average priced lunch .
The dumplings are well - packed and well - made , but you usually get about 4 - 5 pieces ( it 's standardized , but i do not remember how many exactly you get with each bowl / order ) .
If the fact that it 's owned by the guy who owns ming 's ( another popular hk cafe south of pacific mall ) does not peak your interest , then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will ?
Black - eyes pea salad - 5 stars cast - iron cornbread - 5 stars grilled oysters - 5 stars shrimp & grits - 4 stars ( but i suspect shrimp & grits just is not my thing ) apple pie dessert - 4.5 ( only because it had a hint of nutmeg or something i do not care for ) - looking forward to trying the bourbon chocolate cake next !
Not bad food .
The only thing i was not very happy about is the service at the beginning when we entered in the restaurant .
We made a reservation for 8.30 and the table was not available so they sent us to the bar upstairs for a drink which is fine .
Once our table was ready someone came to inform us upstairs but our cocktails were not ready yet .
We were informed that we had to pay upstairs for the cocktail which i understand because the cash registered are not on the same floor but it does not really make sense when you are about to have dinner in the establishment .
Also since the drinks were not ready they could have told ask the barman to cancel the order and ask for it for us downstairs .
I mean it 's not mid-season where you have a light jacket , it 's winter when you have the big winter coat .
Everything looked great , but did not taste very authentic or good .
Unless there 's no better place to go , i 'd give it a miss .
I used to boast about this place , not any more the food quality has gotten poor not worth the price and is either under cooked or greasy .
The bartenders are 90 % female who have obviously not been trained in customer service and just expect to be tipped for just being there . ( occupation ornaments ) .
Not a bad place to get some food but it gets confusing when there 's like ten different menus they give you that you are not too sure what to order .
Apps were good not great , i really liked the sloppy joses , the salsa was interesting as well with a hint of cumin in it .
Stopped in for a rare thursday night dinner out without the kids ( that never happens ) .
It 's not quite a unicorn , but it 's pretty rare .
Imperial garden has a litany of awards from madison magazine and i am certainly not going to disagree with the well earned accolade .
The crowd skews a little older and more gentile , but it should not matter because you will likely be more focused on trying to cram as much delicious food onto your chopsticks as you can .
Again , my fault for not reading it clearly on the menu but i am not too sure that combination ( cold sandwich with stuffing and turkey ) works .
Also , some of the servers did not look too friendly .
Seemed like they did not like being there .
I would not venture all the way out to red rock to try this .
I sat at a table with a couple of friends but the server was not present for at least 15 mins after i got there so i obviously went up to the bar to get numerous drinks .
Did not think too much of it and got my second round at the bar as my friends payed their server who was not present at all .
Then as my friends and i were going to play pool the server approached us about not tipping her well .
We decided against playing pool and left and now i do not plan on going back because i do not want to be set up for failure again .
Such bad service and i will not recommend going to any of my friends .
I can not wait to go back and try out the other stuff on their menu , including the giant pancake that some lady got , stuffed with ...
I do not know , i did not want to stare .
Went on a monday dinner , restaurant itself is not so fancy but food was good .
I almost did not want to share this place .
I am not a huge fan of dumplings but they were good .
Cash only but no complaint .
Never had a problem here so i will be coming back !
One thing i do not like about this place is , that we can not get seated unless everyone in the group shows up .
Please do not buy a used car from this company or you will be screwed .
Since they could not determine whether or not it broke because it was old and brittle , or if it was their bad and accidentally broke it off , they replaced the radiator for free !
If you are not sure what to get , the waitresses are really helpful too !
She was helpful and accommodating , and actually went to talk to the chef about it , who said it was no mistake , but was totally willing to re-make the dish with less sugar !
- yes , i have had szechuan style spicy dishes in restaurants in szechuan , hong kong , shanghai , and in a few chinatowns in the states , but no , i have never tasted a szechuan dish with such sweetness before .
I have been here many times and on my first time i was here i found something disgusting on the floor which i can not say here .
I have not seen the same thing again since that day and i have been back here many times .
The menu is not very helpful , no pictures .
They use english but it 's not very helpful in describing the item .
I can not say enough about the customer service that tj and his crew provides .
The maple cream does not really improve the experience though .
Cake was not " chocolatey " enough .
Came in here before my morning flight and was not expecting much considering that it 's an airport restaurant but thankfully this place delivered !
It all started a week before move - in day , where we received emails demanding first month 's rent a week earlier than the date listed on the lease because no one would be on site to take payments that day .
Despite having a half - full parking lot on the busiest of nights residents are still required to pay a parking fee , and we are not allowed visitors unless we get them passes during business hours .
Also , this means no food deliveries unless you want to walk to the front gate .
The latest is threatening a large fee if management has to come check your extinguisher if you do not bring it down to them which you can only do during times most of us are at school or work .
Sure , skip a final this week to make sure peak campus does not get another dime out of you .
The washer has been broken for months , roof in the bathroom is leaking , maintenance requests have no meaning here , and staff gets defensive when it 's brought up .
Peak campus has no problem exploiting struggling students and will continue to do so .
The proximity to campus is not all that worth it .
I am also a fan of their " banquet " specials , which is for when you go in groups and they offer you a selection of x many dishes to share for a set price per person ( this is available for lunch and dinner i believe , though i have never been here for lunch ) .
The key to any good sandwich however is the bread and lets just say capriotti 's is no subway .... and that 's a good thing .
That s not to say it was not good , because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm , buttery pastrami , coleslaw , mayo and russian dressing , you better not be on cholesterol meds when you try it !
Their fried rice is very flavorful and satisfying all on its own ( the entree , not part of lunch menu ) .
I have had their lunch specials and sure , i was not impressed and i would give them less stars had they been the only thing i have tried .
Definitely a step down if you are used to eating at , say , chicago 's chinatown ( both old and new sections ) , and there 's no extra menu in chinese with the more eclectic stuff .
Went there the other night with friends in the beginning the service was not horrible but it seemed as soon as the rest of our party started to arrive the server seemed less present and more irritated .
Also right before happy hour ended we put two drink orders in and the server responded with " okay i will put your order in but it probably will not be happy hour anymore " my other friend stated we still had like 5 minutes and she replied " well i guess i will run " .
She actually had the nerve to ask us what she did wrong and why we did not tip her more !
I was so shocked it was ridiculous and unprofessional it really made me wish i had not left a tip which was just a courtesy really .
In the end we felt uncomfortable because all the bartenders and servers were staring at us so we ended up leaving and most of us agree that we will not be returning to that location .
I have had this dish at other restaurants but they put too much onions and their not really cooked all the way .
Being a vegetarian , i can not say much about the non-veg dishes though .
First , they do not cater to those who do not read chinese .
We were seated with an english menu and every price on the menu was scratched out , nor do they bother to explain anything .. like oh i dunno , how much per person it is , that broths are extra charges ( those might be important to the average diner ) .
So my first question is , why can not they update both menus and why are the old menus still circulating ?
I also had to get another server to explain all the new items on the chinese menu that were not indicated on our old menu ... which might have seemed a little tedious , but i felt like it was not fair since i did not read chinese .
The service was not that great .
Not sure if it was a language barrier , or missed on the back end , but we had to re-order things 3 times before they came .... and some just never came .
Not sure if it was a language barrier , or missed on the back end , but we had to re-order things 3 times before they came .... and some just never came .
I prefer mixing my own sauces , and do not like having to order each sauce individually .
The food quality was not bad , but i would much prefer little sheep to this place .
Oil change , a / c fixed not blowing cold but better than driving with windows down all the time in arizona .
He told me they could not get an oil change done today and was irritated that i even showed up .
He was short and rude and i will not be bringing my vehicle back here in the future .
I have been coming here since the 80s and never miss a chance to eat here every time i am in madison .
Can not seam to find anything to compare !
I could not be more happy about the service they gave him .
Taking in to consideration that my son is not mechanically inclined , he was treated with honesty and professionalism .
I was ready to jump in in case it sounded like he was being taken advantage of but it was not necessary .
Realistically though no one is really coming upstairs for the food , instead it 's a place to dance to some good music ( mostly hiphop ) and have some good cocktails .
I will say , that this faux exclusiveness is a little much because no one even asked us for the password when we got in .
Additionally , they have a " vip " area which you can not get into unless you know someone , but this area is literally the same thing as the other side .
Usually i do not expect much service from a " hk style " tea house but this one is exceptionally bad , to a point i felt irritated .
I took out one star from the review , because of their timing does not agree with me as i preferred weekend and evening eating out .
Pictures do not lie
You will not go wrong at this family owned and operated restaurant .
Not a lot of place serve this dessert so i had to get it .
Told him i would be calling a lawyer if they called again and also filled a complaint with the bbb asking them not to call and for an official apology for their harassment .
Got a note back saying that they would not contact me again .
No apology .
Do not eat here .
It is on the pricier side but it s always fresh and excellent quality so i am not complaining .
I would not go out of my way to go here .
Please do not insult chettinad food .
No more karaikudi .
I have noticed with other pho restaurants , they were good but not mind blowing .
What really knocked off the stars for them , is the waitresses here clearly do not care for getting anything you ask .
But never would she come back with the mystical cup of water .
So can not really give them more than 2 stars for the anti social waitress that served ... erhm or did not serve us .
Wow i am surprised i had not yet reviewed this place .
The service here has always been great , we have always been able to make reservations and they were always prompt about seating us when we did not make one .
Not fantastic , but not bad either .
On top of this , the lamb itself did not taste great and was kind of chewy .
For this reason alone , i probably will not be back .
The chive dumplings ( another standard order ) also did not taste very good .
I usually do not care about service ( i just want good food ) , but this cold service was quite obvious .
The waitress did not crack a smile once .
Did not say thanks at the end when we paid the bill .
Ps. not sure if i 'd order korean here .
The dealership vehemently denied this , but at this point i was not going to trust anyone at the dealership .
Never preassured us and reassured us that he was there to make us happy .
They did not mind me test driving multiple cars until i found exactly what i wanted and i did not feel pressured in any way .
I highly recommend this dealership and will never go anywhere else !
If i could give this place no star i would .
The furniture is not up to the standers they advertise in the tour .
Do not waist your time or money .
Also it 's in the ghetto my apt was broken into the gates do not make it safe .
Let 's just say you will not be paying a premium for that .
This place does not take credit card as indicated on their page .
I would never return to moral village again and will not recommend it to anyone .
Was going to try a side of greens but not for 6.00 .
Ewwwww this is an update to my previous review , but i am never going back here because it was actually forced closed for a period because they failed their dinesafe certification : 2 crucial infractions including failing to protect food from contamination and food promise maintained in manner permitting health hazard ... and their service really sucked anyway
10 mins later her and her friend have lunch in our spots and the manager did not gamble at all .
Because we were not ordering something every few minutes it took longer to actually find our server when we needed her .
The place was not very busy and i am not surprised .
My best suggestion is that if you are looking for good chinese food , this is not the place to go .
Waited 20 minutes for a seat ( not the worse by any means ) , but then was promptly seated in the bar for dinner by a cold drafty window where everyone else waiting for their tables congregated .
Essentially not very nice ambiance nor were the hosts very accommodating to the request of a place elsewhere .
In a nutshell , if you have every eaten chinese food outside of wisconsin and in a large metropolitan area such as chicago , new york , etc. , this is not the place to go .
The restaurant appears to cater to those who most likely have never traveled 20 miles outside the town they grew up in and find cheese curds the ultimate appetizer .
Salesman was friendly , knowledgable and not pushy by any means .
Flight ( $ 32 , mixed ceviche ) : seafood was fresh and i love ceviche chori papa ( $ 16 , chorizo , peppers , goat cheese , tortillas ) : duck chaufa ( $ 35 , basically a bibimbap ) : weird this dish is called " chaufa " and not bibimbap because it 's almost exactly what it is .
It was very tasty , not heavy with a hint of sweetness .
We ordered 3 desserts to share with the table , and though i am not sure they are made in house ( they looked so perfect ) they were each very delicious and well made .
Can not wait to go back !
The service was also average , but i would not expect more for a hk style cafe .
I 'd recommend the bbq duck ; it tastes great and did not have too much fat on it .
Overall , i do not think there is anything special about this place but if you are looking for a quick brunch spot , this could be it .
We misread the menu and did not realize there 's actually no duck included in the first course - disappointing .
The skin was also not crispy as advertised , but rather chewy and oily .
Their sliced beef was marbled - just - enough despite it not being the premium option .
Driving back monday , my mom wanted to make sure it was not anything serious .
We called kinkade and explained our situation and they saw us immediately with no appointment necessary .
They fixed the broken piece for the drive back and even called for quote on the replacement piece so i would not be ripped off when i get it replaced when i get back in town .
They did this with friendly service and no charge .
I was not feeling to well and the drive back to cali was rough , but thank you to this great shop for making ride back safer and survivable .
But only thing one worker was watching the game on the bar do not get me wrong i will all for that but he was being noise hearing us talk and kept looking over .
I have not been to any hot pot restaurant in canada before but i am told the quality of the food was probably about average .
Going in , i read the service was not great but i did not think it would have affected me so much .
Our server looked annoyed ( and i am not saying this lightly ) when we ordered .
In all my dealing with him i always got a sense that i was annoying him and that he did not want any part of serving us .
While the meal was good , i did not think it was worth $ 32 plus tax and tip .
Overall , the food was good but i can not justify paying so much for lousy service and a small portion of dessert .
Came here for dumplings and they did not disappoint .
It will expand 5 times like no body 's business and absorb your yummy soup .
While a modern take on southern favorites is not a new concept , it 's a welcome addition to the madison dining scene .
You will not regret it .
He brings me a egg drop soup and i said " oh i ordered the hot & sour soup " and he replied " no you did not " .
The food is delicious and they do not cheap out on the protein portions .
But i never see them smile .
The bin was nasty looking , with at least three other things that were contaminating it and the gentleman did not take the older tomatoes out first to put them on top ( to be used next / first ) .
* gross alert * true story : do not mean to trash this place , but we used to come to this place quite a bit before , and then there was this one time that one of us spotted a waitress trying to floss her teeth with her bare fingers , and she was the one taking out the noodle bowls .
But recently we found out that waitress is no longer working there , so we brave souls came back here to give it another try .
Fyi - we never got stomach aches after eating here .
This soup also included shrimp paste , so definitely not recommended for anyone that can not handle fishy smell and taste .
It 's alright to come here if you do not have a high standard of cleanliness * , want vietnamese food with affordable prices , and quick service .
The food either takes forever to come or it never comes at all .
Do not forget to try their deep fried buns too , one of my must have s every time i go .
The best part about ethnic buffets is that you can try small tastes of everything you would not normally order .
When i came here for dinner , it was just ok , the prices worked out to be ~ $ 20 + per person , so it s not the greatest value .
Service for the buffet lunch was not great .
Obviously , changing the ownership made no difference .
Once they have decided that the fans were not working a week later , they decided to knock out half of the walls in my room and a piece in my living room .
I am currently forced to sleep in a room with barely any insulation , and a window with no blinds , as well as a huge and loud dehumidifier .
I just left the office to ask where they expect me to stay until the repair is complete and the manager literally said " this is not our fault ; there are fifteen other residents going through the same thing .
I know that sounds convenient ; but when you take into account that you are paying about $ 700 for a bedroom per person , barely have access to guest parking , deal with rude and inconsiderate management , live in filth , and get charged for simply breathing , the shuttle bus and 1982 furniture just does not seem to suffice .
My advice is to not lease with rebel place .
The rent is overpriced and not worth it at all .
Do not do it .
Went to baro for the first time on a date , and although the date did not go so well , this place is my new favourite bar .
I have not had a proper meal here yet either than some chips and dip , which were pretty good for such a simple order .
Not a lot of flavor .
Seems solid , clean , fresh ... will not come back unless i am in the area and craving pho .
I am not saying that that 's the only reason for this low review .
Unless you speak fluent mandarin , not even cantonese , you will not have a good time i will not be coming back to this restaurant ever again regardless if there is a change in management or not .
Do not take this review lightly .
I will not be giving this restaurant " another try "
You can not beat the atmosphere of this place .
The only downfall is that they do not do delivery , but they do pick up !
I have been to the upstairs bar many time but somehow never got a chance to check out the actual restaurant .
If you get the beer bites membership that goes thru pt 's and sierra gold you get half off drinks but i am not sure if that 's limited to a certain time frame .
I was not impressed with the gilroy as it kinda made me feel nauseated and i was super bummed b/c i love garlic more than salt to be honest with you .
And the food has yet yet to not be consistenly awesome !
The food is good but definitely not worth that much .
Can not say if it was the private room or the items that i ordered , i suppose i see this as more of a restaurant than more of a bar to just sit at and drink .
1 - they do not seem to care about the quantities you order .
It 's annoying to not know if anything else from what you ordered is coming .
I would not mind paying it as part of the base price , but felt misled to pay on top of the base price .
I initially ordered the cheese steak ( which i was really looking forward to ) - but was told that it was still frozen and not ready ( i got there at 11 am ) .
Just when i thought my sublime sub cuisine could not get any better , i had a bite of a cheese steak sub with mushrooms ... shut the front door and all the windows .... daaaaamn this place rocks ... you will crave these subs !
It is worth the trip , jesus the service writer is outstanding along with the service tech ( can not remember his name ) .
Yeah , i have tried other sandwiches they make ( and they are great too ) , but my motto is : " if it ai not broke , do not f**k with it ! "
Thry just do not care .
The servers are very rude , loud , gross and have no consideration for diners .
They organize their chopsticks with clanking sound on the table very loudly while diners are still there , talk very loudly with their coworkers in their own language and they never thank your business with them as if they are doing you some kind of favours .
My parents always order the same kind of pho but few times , they did not have any basil and they said they do not know when the delivery is coming .
Today , they did not have any bean sprouts then my parents looked slightly annoyed / disappointed .
Instead of apologizing or offering other kind of ingredients , the server just shrugs her shoulders and says they do not have it as she walks away .
Somehow , only 2 minutes later , they magically had their bean sprouts and the server said it 's coming in a few minutes and said " you are lucky ! " as if that ingredient is not supposed to be in the food and we somehow got it by luck .
No such server has ever managed to flabbergast me with a comment like hers in my life .
I found that very strange , like they somehow do not want to serve certain ingredients if people do not ask for it but do if people ask for it , even though the ingredient is listed on their menu .
The only reason it gets 4 stars is because can not rate in half .
We got our salads , then suddenly the food was at the table did not have time to rest a minute between salad and main course .
I ordered chili as well and that never came til i asked about the chili .
Putting things in cute containers does not mask that the recipes were the most simplistic available and still lacked flavour and the ingredients were run of the mill .
We tried to deal with the situation but did not want to make a scene at our friend 's birthday .
The issues were not dealt with in a timely or professional matter .
She talked with us as a friend not a salesperson .
She made us feel very comfortable and was not pushy .
Seems like a sales tactic , turns out they do not make comission .
The only thing i am not a huge fan of is the hot and sour soup ; good flavor , but way too viscous for me .
The manager , karen , seems to never go home because she is always there to make sure things are going well and is very personable .
Everyone here wants to please you and it s up to you to do something then not the next day .
My only complaint here , and it 's not their fault , is that if you are coming from the east side it involves a little navigating to get to their driveway which is a little tricky .
Just recently moved in a few months ago and have not had any complaints , it s conveniently located to everything you need ( shopping centers , unlv , strip , etc ) .
I am okay with the " asian " service i.e. efficient , quick , no effort at communication besides taking your order - that i have 0 problem with .
But if i am getting attitude while ordering for no reason then i am 100 % unhappy to be there .
This place follows the toronto tapas trend that forces me to evolve past my joey tribiani mantra of not sharing food .
Toronto is all about shareable plates , and baro is no different .
That said i do not think this dish is worth $ 15 for what you get .
First , there was not an over - abundance of citrus .
I did not get very much of this dish so i 'd like to return and try it again .
I did not drink any alcohol but the cocktails my friends ordered looked incredibly well made with a high degree of skill and precision put into making them .
Finally a chinese restaurant in madison that does not make me mad !
Which is awesome because i do not eat pork !
Tonight we entered during shift change and our waitress did not show up for 20 minutes .
I asked to speak to the manager but she never showed up .
Passed by us multiple times but never stopped .
Too many choices in the area so we will not be back for food or drink .
I do not know the exact number , but there should be around 15 dumplings per order .
Other dishes they have are equally as good , and despite not being an authentic korean place , their korean dishes are tasty too .
The service is not the best , but that may be in part that the waitresses have very limited english skills .
Either way , while the service is not outstanding , the servers do their jobs effectively .
He refuses to respond to calls and emails and i still have not received an explanation for not sending the check as promised .
I went there a second time because i could not remember if i liked the food or not ( yes , it was that unremarkable ) .
Upon going there the second time , i knew there would not be a third .
What should have been an immediate tip - off was the fact that there were not any chinese words on the menu ... and that all the clientele was white ( again , yes i know this is madison , but this is compared to other chinese restaurants like fugu or ichiban ) .
I do not actually remember the specific dishes i ordered ( i have had fish , chicken , pork , and beef there ) , but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months .
I will not be going back .
Been here twice now , both times for drinks and never disappointed .
I also appreciate how quickly the replenish their dishes , so you never have to wait long to try something .
Warning : their dishes are spicy and if you can not handle spice , their dishes will set fire to your digestive system .
If you are coming for lunch on a weekday you can probably get away with not making a reservation .
They do not split bills , and requested that we pay in cash if we wanted to pay separately .
The guy at the dealership said they may forgive the damage entirely , and that it did not look that bad -- at most , it should not go over $ 1000 , if they do say we owe anything at all .
Well , not only did the door damage get charged for over $ 1300 , but they charged another $ 1500 on random dings etc .... that did not exist !!!
Well , not only did the door damage get charged for over $ 1300 , but they charged another $ 1500 on random dings etc .... that did not exist !!!
If there is even a risk of these kinds of amounts coming back to lessees -- the dealership should 1 . warn clients to never lease a car , and 2 . buy it out , if you do , because you will get royally screwed at the time of buy - out .
If the dealership , or mazda , or the leasing company does not make this right ....
I guarantee we will never buy a mazda again .... we will warn everyone to stay clear of mazda and their inept / shady business practices , and stay clear of chase leasing as well -- the banksters strike again -- such a corrupted world we live in !
I am basically buying a used car at $ 4500 , with no car !
Did not seem like much time was spent preparing it .
But hey ; street food is good and never clean .
I tend to stick to pho and not venture much but my coworkers thoroughly enjoy the bun selection too .
No apology , we had it exchanged .
We ordered about 8 items , and one of the orders never came .
We asked them twice if everything came , and both times they said yes , but there was an item we specifically ordered that never came .
Although the food here is cheap , nobody wants to pay for food they never got .
The restaurant could definitely stand for a makeover ... if you are looking for a homely atmosphere you will not find it here !
Not a first date spot for sure .
If you are at the point in the relationship where anything goes then it will not be a problem ; ) was not the most pleasant service ... instead the woman wordlessly pointed in the general direction where we could choose a seat then silently handed us the order sheet and then crept up a few minutes later and took it back .
This place has the best wings in town and great food , but no longer allows anyone under 21 ... even though that is not the majority of their business , this change is going to cost them business not gain .
Did not get seated untill 1.5 hrs of waiting .
Okay so another 10 min rolled on , and a few more couples getting seated that were not there when we arrived , and tables and booths were looking pretty vacant !
Hostess that took my name looked at me like she had no idea who i was , looked at the buzzer , then to her screen , and without saying a word to me called over someone to seat us .
Got to the seat .... no bread . waited 10 min for the waiter ... who took our drink orders only to come back after another 5 min to tell me my beer was not available .
Got to the seat .... no bread . waited 10 min for the waiter ... who took our drink orders only to come back after another 5 min to tell me my beer was not available .
No beer . ordered fried pickles for appetizer . pickles were good till the bottom , then got very soggy .
Lesson for us : do not go on a wednesday unless you have kids , and you want to experience the chucky cheese atmosphere ..... cause it 's kids night !.
It will be a while before we go back .... and it will not be on a wednesday .
On the outside the little plaza looks pretty crummy and small but do not let the looks throw you off .
Soup was scolding hot and not overly salty .
The beef pancake was filled with shredded beef and there were some chucks of fat which i was not a huge fan of .
And do not be intimidated just because it s a chinese run place .
If you are at the red rock do not go to capriotti's .
This place does not even deserve 1 star .
Do not believe them when they tell you the apartment " will be exactly like the model unit " .
The breezeways look like they have not been cleaned in years .
Rebel place said they never received it .
I am not sure what is wrong this petticoat junction type establishment ; however , i am contacting my attorney today regarding this late fee and the cleaning being refused .
Do not move here !!
I would suggest reading the reviews from gerry , ana , and caroline ... everything i did not cover , they did .
I do not know if it is because school is just starting and it is a once - a- year project or if it because of a new manager , but ... last week , the walkways and steps were all power washed , the parking lot was repainted , and all the trash was picked up around the place ( till the students started throwing it wherever they happened to be standing again ) .
Again , i do not know if it was just a once - a- year thing they do in august but it has been very nice for about a week and a half .
The counter person - who took my order - said " did not they tell you that takes longer ? "
Also , no ice in dispenser at 10:30 am .
The counter person said , " is it empty ? " obvious answer , it was never filled yet today even though they had been open for hours .
My bbh was made with what tasted like pre-made soup base with not enough flavours ( the red was concentrated on one side of my bowl ) .
Although the portion was decently sized , i felt that the quality is not there .
Probably will not be returning .
Just had to get something not too filling .
The food came really fast , was good and well served , but as the place was crowded , they did not give us any attention .
Disgusting ... disgusting i do not understand how some people are giving this place 4 - 5 stars ..... absolutely ridiculous .
There are many pho restaurants in the city that are way better so do not waste your time and money here .
They never opened .
Just from this experience , i would not trust these guys with any car .
This place always finds an excuse to not cook anything the last 30 minutes it is open .
The pizza used to be delicious and now it s not so much .
Never going back .
2 star = not good .
I will not go back , but it was nt absolutely awful .
3 star = good , not great .
It was a big pricey -- we paid $ 75 with tip , no alcoholic drinks .
Also they do not give warnings to when they will be doing fire alarms for buildings or high water power cleaning outside of our doors .
The servers are friendly enough and the food is not bad .
The pizza is made in a thin crust style and is better than you 'd find at most casual bars but certainly does not compare to a quality pizza joint .
The wings are not bad , better than bww .
They have a fair selection of beers on tap but it s not enough to satisfy the curiosity of a beer snob like me .
I do not have strong feelings about this place one way or the other -- it s a decent place to hang out in the day or for a monday night football game , but i do not suggest it for special occasions or dates .
I think i am fairly picky about food and service as there are a bunch of local restaurants i have tried that i will not go back to .
Now i suppose this is americanized chinese food but then i am not chinese and have not been to china so i would not know for certain .
You just can not miss them .
Overall , you never get pest control when you ask them .
Everyone was pleasant and helpful at the dealership , but i still do not like how they try and sneak extra money in there .
The internet price it showed , still was not the final price .
They still added a $ 1000 plus fee in there that was not advertised .
I told the guy i did not want that and they basically said , that was not negotiable .
I have not yet found any dealership that i walk out of excited about a car .
Not really interested in dining here .
The mongolian beef was sweet not spicy , which was annoying .
But i do not have the patience or language skills to find out .
My benchmark is roscoes in la and otherwise do not do a lot of soul food .
I do not get the other yelpers but my service experience was fine at 6:45 on a monday night .
Thigh juicy , drum stick not so much , the crust was a bit salty but otherwise crispy , good and not greasy .
I have only gone at lunch for the buffet , and it 's a solid selection , and focuses on food from the chettinad region in tamil nadu , which is known for its specific spiciness . presentation : buffet , not much to say , dosa made on request , south indian coffee delivered traditionally , held in steel cup placed upside down in a steel saucer taste : delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness .
Healthiness : good , but not great , quite a bit of oil value : excellent , what you 'd expect for scarborough dining
The wooden walls with lamps hanging from above mixed with neon lights ( not exactly the name , not sure what it 's called ) , creates a modernized feel .
I did not eat all the items aforementioned .
The satay soup was not spicy .
However , the soups were not mind blowing , staying within the same chapters of its contemporaries .
Maybe not the adventure i expected to be .
Morals village is not a great restaurant .
I guess i did not realize that , unlike all the other sub joints , capriotti 's uses real , fresh turkey !! , and that helps explain why their prices are a bit higher than the competition .
I 'd love to see a smaller one at a smaller price , but i bet not too many people would share this nit .
The mongolian beef had zero taste , did not even taste like what mongolian beef should taste like plus the meat was orange !
The white rice was filled half way , like they ran out and did not want to make more .
I do not recommended this place .
It was enough that he got me my huge 12 incher promptly ...... boy that does not sound right ..... look at the picture instead .
T saddens me that there are no capriotti 's in downstate new york .
It s location is pretty convenient as it 's right across from markville mall and for the few times i have been here , parking was not a problem .
The pot stickers had a lot of meat but i was not really a fan of them .
I will return again whenever i want fast and cheap dumplings but i will probably not order any noodles again .
Imperial garden was hopping at dinner time but it did not take more than a few minutes to be seated .
I do not quite feel compelled to drive there from downtown for food , but if i still lived on the west side i 'd probably be a somewhat regular customer since it 's one of the better options in that area .
Hands down , no questions asked , i always prefer wheat to white .
I just thought cap 's did not offer that option .
Nope , this cap 's does not offer that option .
Which , i am not willing to do , but thought it was an interesting option all the same .
Had great pre-sales / sales support , but what they told me in the dealership was not what was actually delivered .
I do not recommend this dealership .
Immediately after notifying him of my negative posting ( in my email ) , i received an email from my sales person who informed me that they were not going to do anything regarding the misrepresentation he did on my vehicle .
They should not be operating
And it 's the only decent chinese in the desert foothills ( shanghai club in anthem ai not bad ) .
Either are often quite obviously * wrong * in other restaurants but not here .
I always order it without pork but no one else at the table seems to care because the deliciousness is nevertheless quite potent !
I will never come back here .
They never come to clear the dirty plates so they just pile up all over the table .
They forgot half of what we ordered and it was like pulling teeth trying to find a waiter to order more food ( or to ask wtf happened to the stuff we ordered 45 minutes ago and never came ) .
When you asked for something they would say uhhhh one sec and never come back .
For this price we did not even get mediocre food and service .
Do not go here .
Do not eat here .
I initially decided to get 4 bottles and was thinking about getting another 2 but i quickly changed my mind when i realized that my business was not appreciated at this establishment .
I told him i had another 4 guests that were arriving a little later ( the rest of us arrived at 1030 ) and he told me to tell them not to come because they will not get in .
It s unfortunate because i really like baro but i do not think i will come back again .
You did not even take our dirty plates away from us so we could have after dinner conversation .
Surprisingly you can not choose the type of soup .
Chicken taste bland and not roasted correctly .
Rib sauce was spicy n not listed as spicy .
My 8 yr old nephew did not even eat his burger because it was dry .
Service was great but not the food .
Wish i can expand on it more but honestly the sandwich was not that memorable .
I do not know why lots of reviews indicate that the service is bad here , but actually i received pretty service every time i came here :0 ( because i can speak cantonese ? ) food here is okay , but it is a good place to eat cuz i can have many choices here !
Favourites : nikkei ceviche , choir papa , duck chaufau ( do not compare this to regular fried rice ) , pulpo charred octopus five flower cocktail $ 17 ( worth it ) so - so : chicken wings , empanadas , matambre ( flank steak ) dislike : ice cream dessert , choros ( not bad but way too much sugar )
First clue that it was not going to go well ... no chopsticks on the table and we were never offered any .
The food is edible , but i would not rave about it .
It 's certainly not worth the prices .
Then to disguise the fact that for $ 17 , they are only serving you 8 small / medium size ( not even large ) shrimp , they pile them on top of a bed chopped green onions and cilantro .
We could not understand it . do not people get that they are paying out the nose for mediocre , pseudo asian / chinese food ?
We could not understand it . do not people get that they are paying out the nose for mediocre , pseudo asian / chinese food ?
They said no and seated us at a four person table .
It was a bit fatty but probably not the best but can not beat $ 8.99 for 8 skewers .
So if you are looking for a cool place with latino vibe and great service do not waste your time there .
I do not like to share bad reviews but this is something that i need to share with everyone interested on this place to eat and party .
It was a little out of our budget at the time and it being our second car there was not any rush to fix it .
I could not believe it !
I trust kinkade 's and could not recommend them enough !!
The customer service is excellent , no hard sales tactics , no pushy office staff and they even have a shuttle service .
Since there was a group of us , we were able to taste a number of dishes . because indian food is not exactly cheap nor are the portions big , i will base my individual ratings mainly on the quality of the food and their prices / portions .
I did not find it overly spicy that you would lose it s flavour so i thoroughly enjoyed this .
5 / 5 . butter chicken - did not exactly try the chicken but i definitely tried the sauce .
I have never had such creamy sauce .
Some people drink the swiss chalet sauce and if i were not watching my diet right now , i 'd be drinking this sauce , too .
5 / 5 . boiled egg - i know it 's boiled egg but some people do not know how to boil a damn egg .
Again , do not get me wrong , it was delicious , but i have had better .
You also will not really know until you receive it and after digging underneath the rice ( yes , i caved in and ordered rice ) .
Finally got to try this hotpot place , though it was a holiday and we did not have reservations so we had to eat at 4 pm . the soup base is additional charge , we tried corn , mushroom , and pork bone .
English does not do a good job of describing asian food , which is a huge shame because this place is ah-mazing .
Unfortunately , that is not saying much .
Food is good but not worth going for because service is terrible .
Was told once for not tipping " to go home and cook , instead of coming to dine in " .
She made it clear so i no longer buy from here .
I did not think a walk up counter would do a good job .
Oh man , if service did not suck , i would have ordered more of that yummy chicken and mac & cheese to eat on the plane !
No lease give them a try if you need auto service ; you will not be disappointed .
I was please to be seated immediately upon arrival , something that does not always occur often since the restaurant is always busy .
This was not the usual salad that i am accustomed to .
While the service was great , the food was not .
I am sad to say that i am not sure i plan on going back any time soon .
They constantly find reasons to go through your apartment on a regular basis , with bogus reasons such as " key checks " , a week after they did a room inspection ( be prepared to be treated like a child , this is not your room , it 's theirs ) .
Ac guy did not even come into apartment , assumed it was fine and checked the service request as completed ( still 80 + degrees ) .
Ac guy claimed to clean filter and defrost coils , said to turn ac on after an hour ( did so , forgot to place ac unit switch to on , still sweating at night , it 's july with no ac ) third service request : called office , they told me the ac guy told me to flip switch ( he should have done that himself ) , i told them i did and it still does not work , she told me she 'd check in with him ... hours go by , it 's now 4 am in the morning and 80 degrees in my apartment .
No email , no written letter , nothing .
Not sure , because nobody has told me yet .
I fell in love with this place years ago because their butter chicken is incredibly buttery and their lamb briyani is delicious but what i do not like is their prices .
Been going there for 13 years and have never had bad food or service .
The gym is not all that but it s ok .
I have no real complaints .
You can find nicer places for the same price but they will not be this close to the strip and unlv .
I moved out of this complex in july , and still have not gotten my $ 300 security deposit back !!!
Order 1 pancake , not the stack of 3 because it is huge and deathly sweet .
I would definitely not order the full stack .
We split the one pancake , which is huge and includes all the same toppings , between 3 people but could not even finish it because it was so sweet .
The rice was not good .
I was completely not a fan of the beans .
Overall , it was a good portion of food , but for a price tag of $ 23 , i was not impressed .
And geeeez can not say enough about our server jason so very helpful went over the menu with us explained everything .
I have already been to morals village a number of times but never wrote a review until now .
Been going there for about 12 years now and i still have not had better chinese food .
I have only had maybe one dish that i did not like .
Everything there seems to hit the sweetspot of being not too salty or greasy and always saucy enough .
Ended up buying the car , but will not do business with them or any other car dealer again .
The place is filthy and not maintained at all .
Really , not on this mothers watch .
After being in town 6 months there are decent places for college kids to live .. not rebel place .. none of you belong in a place with rats in the dumpsters ..
This place do not even have bahn bao , and they call themselves authentic ?
I am not quite sure where to even begin in regards to my experience living at rebel place .
If i could give this place no star , trust me i would .
From the incompetent management , inhabitable living " units " , and their fanatic shuttle bus drivers , this place is completely not worth the 1,400 + rent. do yourself a favor my friends and trust in these reviews , take your money elsewhere and invest in a better complex .
Firstly , on move in day i could not help but feel cold chills sparked by fear run down my spine the moment i opened my apartment door .
The bed does not even have mattresses , unless you consider a hard navy blue block hard as a rock desirable sleeping spot , then sure .
Totally not worth the money !
If there is one thing that is not true about these horrible reviews , it is that maintenance does not respond to service requests because they sure do :) .
The office never even calls to give you a heads up .
I am not completely sure who constructed this building , but i am on the verge of believing it was the 3 little pigs , because a huff and a puff will blow your apartment down .
Fearing there would be mold , which was probably already there , they decided to place 7 large heavy duty fans in our apartment and a dehumidifier for about a week , i could not even hear myself speak but we were told they must stay on .
When complaining to the office about our situation , they told us it was our fault , we still have to pay rent , and they will not give us another place to stay in for the meantime .
Last time i checked i was paying $ 680 for a bedroom , not to sleep on some old dingy couch .
There is so much more i have to say about this place but i simply do not have the time seeing that i am currently working out a civil court case against peakcampus ... do not move here ladies and gentlemen .
Everyone comes here for lunch you can not beat the deal .
Food is not bad but not great .
Not a bad place to eat :)
I have had nothing but problems with these guys and i can not even begin to tell you the crap we are going through right now as our transmission has gone kaput .
Very fresh and flavorful and not skimpy at all .
Of all the other dumpling locations that i have tried , i do not think i have found a place that trumps this place .
As well , i like that the dumpling skin is not too thick and is a great balance to the filling .
The pork bone soup was just alright , the soup could have been more flavourful but the meat was tender and juicy so no complains on that front .
If i can give no stars , i would definitely do it !
I can not begin to tell what a bad experience i had in this place .
It was not busy and it looked like a huge group of 10 people were about to leave .
We answered in english but he did not seem to know much of it or maybe acted like he did not know ??
But when we ordered the second round , the food did not come for a good 15 min .
Especially when there were no customers at that time ?
When we asked for water , it did not even arrive until the end of our meal !!
We flipped out and told him that it 's just not done and that all of us in the table did not even get our share of ice cream .
Seemed like they planned to tell us about the no ice cream story just to see our reaction .
Eventually the ice cream was not served , we then stopped another server and gave him our ice cream order again , he obliged .
By the end of the meal our mood was completely spoilt that we did not feel like staying any longer .
I really do not have any thing to say about the quality of the food , it 's coz the experience was so bad .. we din enjoy our food at all .
That 's the only reason we could think of coz we were a pretty reasonable group who did not even order heaps and heaps of food .
We were not even demanding .
So a little bit of advice to you folks who do not speak chinese - stay away from this place .
No customer should be treated this way .
If they treat their customer this way , they really do not deserve customers .
This is my second time here , the 1st being a few years ago , and i do not know why it took me so long to return because the food was ssooo good .
I also got the chetinnad chicken , which i did not love because there were only 3 pieces in it and 2 of the bigger pieces we mostly none , not worth the $ 12 !
Got a popular mutton dish , but do not remember the name , it was the 1st one on the mutton list .
That 's a sign usually , but i can only imagine that there are not more people because it s smack in the middle of the day .
I can not really complain about my visits , as the food has always been good and the servers are friendly .
The sliders are not bad either and the chicken rice soup they offer is tasty .
But do not show up here with $ 10 and expect to eat though ... my last lunch of soup , sandwich and soda was $ 20 with tip .
I estimate that we have eaten at this location about a dozen times over the years but our last two visits were not great .
Our frustration began in the parking lot because there was no parking so we had to park way in the back .
The front entrance was chaotic with no type of organization .
At the hostess desk , they looked in vain for our call - ahead seating reservation code and they could not find it .
When they realized it was not there , they seated us anyway .
This time , it was not so busy that you could not hear yourself think .
Normally , the noise level in this restaurant when full is cacophonous and not at all pleasant for those sensitive to a loud atmosphere .
By the way , their two - top tables are very small with not a lot of room for plates , drinks and silverware .
I am a fan of chopped steak so i had the road kill with no cheese , baked sweet potato and salad .
My baked sweet potato was good but there was not enough butter for the size of it and there was no brown sugar like i had on our last successful visit .
She did not come back to ask how our food was or how we were doing which is pet peeve number 3 . the server should always check back with the customer a few minutes into their meal .
It does not flow at all and the people who designed the floor plan and should be taken to task for lack of vision .
They talked shit about me while i was there thinking that i was not vietnamese .
They never took the time to listen to me and the fact that i wanted take out .
They forced me to sit down and did not even give me a pen !
I will never ever eat here again !
And i urge you not to either .
We have 3 people and i do not know why they only give us one pair of chopsticks .
I have no idea what did the waitress said when she is turning her back .. fine . we order 3 dishes and ask the waitress how is the taste of one of the dish like .
When one of the dish come , i said this is not the one i order .
I am really mad and ok , now i decided not going there anymore .
I think this restaurant will not last long .
I would not buy another vehicle here , not even for $ 1 .
Do not call expecting your friendly neighborhood mazda dealer .
Whatever you do , do not go to cardinale way mazda mesa .
In fact it was half price when i went , not sure why since it was so late .
I also stopped in for breakfast before catching the plane out of vegas , but i do nt remember what i got , so it must not have left an impression on me .
The free starter soup is super yummy ( was told no msg ) and free dessert in the end was a nice touch .
The soya bean dessert was no good , but the mango pudding was good .
Dinner was not even close to good .. far from good .
I honestly do not know how they managed it .
Not pleased with customer service when i brought my mazda in for service .
I called more than two hours after my appointment time to check on the car as i had not heard anything .
The response was that he did not know the situation with my car and has not been looked at because i brought my car in at the beginning of the morning , at about 745 am for my 11 am appointment .
Does not make any bit of sense to me .
And there was definitely no additional customer service to make up for that .
The female cashier on 6/26 had no sense of urgency whatsoever .
Even another employee came out to get a drink who may have been a supervisor but offered no assistance and there was a line around 12:30 pm .
I have never had this issue at the brick and mortar locations .
Not sure how i feel about the styrofoam container either as it could potentially make everything soggy of you are taking this to go .
He has something you do not find in most mechanics and that s honesty .
You will not find a better mechanic in phoenix !
What 's not to like ?
A lot more people would stay after their lease was up if rent was not so ridiculous .
I really do not want to move next year , i want to stay ... but this area is not worth the price i am paying .
Do not waist your time going there
While we were here we had idli 's and chan na batura , they were both amazing and i would highly recommend that you try both if you have never had south indian food before .
It will be an adventure for you , you will not know what to expect and you will not be disappointed .
All the broths are gluten free ( no soy sauce ) and most of the other items are just raw .
First off , i often do not believe yelp reviews because sometimes a restaurant that others say are bad , are good .
We moved here a year ago and chose this place because it was close to unlv and because they have a shuttle that runs each semester ( not summers ) .
Back then , i did not have a car so it was the most viable option since my roommates worked and could not give me rides .
When we first moved in , we had problems with our grinder , our previous resident had dropped bones inside and the thing was clogged and would not work .
It had flooded the cabinets under the sink and they never fixed it !
I was at first unsure if i was going to keep her and had not registered her yet under the lease .
( good thing it was not rented ) but what if it was ??
They are irresponsible with your mail and do not care if it is damaged or drowned in water .
A few weeks ago , we had a leak in our bathroom from upstairs and we called them in the middle of the night to come and stop the leak , but because we called on a friday night , they said they would not take care of it until monday .
What is the use of the emergency line if they can not even clean up a leak ??
I got a mail saying they were unable to process my request because it was " place of business " so i went to the front office and asked if they could write me a letter or something for the post office and these people do not care !
They said , " oh yeah , because we are a business attached to a residential , we can not do anything " seriously ???
They obviously do not care about their residents , we are just business to them .
Is not that why they have mail forwarding in the first place ??
We never had an empty glass , and each course arrived piping hot .
I have given this place multiple chances and am not going to waste my money any longer .
They never seem to appreciate my patronage -- can not ever get a " thank you . "
Skimpy portions too -- does not filling the white rice containers full or giving soy sauce without having to ask for it really save that much money ?
Too many other options to not consistently get great food and service .
I have been to kinkade 's a few times and have not had any issues .
These guys treat you fair and they do not suggest things just to make a buck .
I am new to rebel place , have not moved in yet but signing and everything was a breeze .
Have not seen our unit yet but the display room was really nice .
But considering the portions , they are not bad !
I do not know if the cook on this particular day was having a bad day , not on his game or ever had a game .
Needless to say , another place which used to have great food and decent service now hit the sucks category and is no long a place we will visit .
The other place i have been going , chipotle , does not have faux - meat options like capriotti's , but you can still order a quick , delicious , nutritious meal there without meat .
The chips are not just the regular tortilla chips but also taro , banana , purple yam , yaca root - very fresh and crispy .
I personally loved this dish not only for it s flavours that remind me of my asian cuisine but it 's cleverness in combining these two cuisines together .
Lastly , was the ginger and chile popsicle that 's water based , but still got a taste of some fruit notes like mango and apricot even though this popsicle might not have those ingredients !
If you decide to do a-la-carte , i suggest not to skip out on the chips and guacamole appetizer , the chicken wings and the chaufa rice dish !
I am especially grateful for this bar , not only for the great food .. but for the awesome bartenders dawn & stacy .
My spicy tofu and vegetables dish was not in the least spicy and the tofu was only fried and would have been better marinated .
Madison has great southast asian restaurants , but i definitely will not be eating more chinese food anywhere here .
- they mistakenly brought rye and gingers instead food - the food came out before the drinks which was not a good start - the chips and guac were very tasty , would have paid 7 $ for this not $ 15 - the tostada was just a giant chip loaded with guac , under it i may have found a tiny bite of chicken - flank steak with chimmichurri was not warm - the tamale was a giant corn cake that tasted like cardboard , very dense and completely under seasoned also could not taste any chicken in it overall the decor and atmosphere were good but compare the prices and food to other great restaurants in king west i would not return or recommend to anyone .
I have never had a problem since i moved in .
Maybe my expectation of a hk cafe is not particularly demanding .
The food is not so good that it could demand high prices , and kitchen m does not charges high prices .
However i was super disappointed it did not taste like the original at all .
The lemonade has always been a favorite at lo - lo 's but it was so watered down - did not taste good at all .
It was definitely not worth the price .
I am sad because lo - lo 's would have been great to showcase what arizona has to offer for tourists at the airport but this particular store def does do not do that !
Since we were not concerned about financing options or anything , the sell was a snap and did not really involve a lot .
When we first got it , we noticed little peculiar things like the trunk light did not turn on and the trunk release would not open the car .
The second key that was given to us , never worked unless you pulled out the keyless remote shield and used the actual key .
Even after replacing it with a new battery , it still would not work .
( this was after was had to ask for a second key which we were told we would get but never received . )
I know these seem like minor irritants and nothing worth mentioning but it sets the precedent of downhill experiences you do not expect from buying a car from a reputable dealership .
The car was not ready on time , so they had extra time to work on these minute issues .
I do not care if the car is $ 9,000 or $ 90,000 .
I want the same service in each transaction or i am not going to repeat my business there or recommend someone to go there .
Next , the car started not to hold a charge .
We had to charge it overnight to make sure that we would not be stuck anywhere .
We connected it to an obd 2 reader to see if there were any codes so we could see where we should take it to and it activated the disarming system in the car and now it will not start .
Noon the next day they still had not called so we called them and left a message .
I do not like my calls not being returned .
I do not like the lackluster attitude to the problem at hand ( which has been constant ) , and the solution was not exactly financially friendly .
If something happens or you need guidance , this is not their main interest .
The place was not fully packed .
And the mustards greens on the side were not dressed with anything , literally just tasted like blanched bitter greens .
Test drove car , did application ... never heard back .
Calls not returned .
Guess they have enough money , they do not need to make a sell ...
It could not fit on the single table .
I do not know how to start .. lol .. busy restaurant .
My quest for the perfect hk egg sandwich continues tho - their scrambled eggs still were not fluffy enough .
Their fried dishes have " wok - hay " , super fresh , and are all pretty flavourful ( from msg no doubt lol ) .
I came into this location to look at a specific car & unfortunately the sale did not work out due to some specifics in the car / limited availability of it .
But i will say brian the sales representative was very transparent with everything & did not try to pressure anything & him as well as his management team were very helpful in trying to help me locate the car i wanted .
Clean , simple , no nonsense , no upselling .
They are certainly not perfect .
And when they are not they admit it and pay for the fixes out of their own pocket .
Previously have been here before but never really have had good customer care .
Not a dull moment .
I told the gentleman i was not paying that .
We shook hands with the sales rep , no hard feelings and left .
Never let anyone associated with a dealership try to tell you differently .
Do not be afraid to walk out .
The taste was so bland that i was not sure what animal the meat came from .
I was hoping that the mongolian beef would save the dinner but unfortunately it had no taste and was as tough as shoe leather .
I have come to the conclusion that since most asian restaurants do not use msg anymore to enhance the flavor that the items on their menu are no longer tasty or juicy anymore .
We never felt pressured from him to buy a car .
When he told me that he was not going to sell me something we did not love , it was genuine .
I liked on his desk his " no lie zone " sign .
They made us an original offer we could not afford , and came back the 2nd time with something in our budget .
This by no means is health food , but definitely a nice treat once in a while .
To bad there 's not a non-smoking section .
They do not loan up to anything .
They told me they could not help me out since it was several months since the oil change .
When you take your car in for service they will come up with several service items that are not necessary .
Had a couple of other reputable autoshops check the items and said the car was excellent condition and no other repairs needed at this time .
We were first seated at a booth that had no waiter we finally got a waiter he gave us complimentary appetizers to make up for the 20 - minute wait .
Matt alone is 5 stars but the reason i did not give the business a 5 star overall is because the service department has not lived up to the bar matt set .
Nothing bad so far with the service department but not 5 star worthy .
Not spicy enough , and far too sour .
Too bad they do not have any of it at the restaurant , it could save many a dish .
Dustin kees is patient and understanding will explain everything with those two you can not go wrong .
I will never go anywhere else
I do not understand why this place is 2 stars !?!
Everything from the angus marbled fatty beef to the lamb ( surprisingly not too gamey ) to the spicy sichuan soup base was delicious !
Unlike some ayce places who tries to ignore u , the staff there are nice and actually follows up with what has not arrived yet !
I was hesitant to check the place out , but i still gave it a chance .. once i visited i fell in love with the room , and having my own bathroom ( which you do not get in the dorms ) as well as 24 hour gym , computer lab , and study room ... the staff was also very friendly , and helpful .
Can not speak about the staff as i got take out .
Uninspired chinese food and poor service ( with the exception of the friendly young hostess , who doubled with bussing duties that the wait staff neglected ! ) we were a group of 10 the evening before thanksgiving -- plates came out late and haphazardly , then were not removed from the table when finished .
It 's not worth comparing in detail the sesame beef vs thai panang chicken vs other stuff , as all were bland and not distinctive .
A mayonaisse chicken dish , to our chagrin , was no more than that : chicken in what appeared to be clumps of hellmann 's mayo or something .
Only reason this does not get 1 star was that i did not come with high expectations for chinese food in this neighborhood anyhow .
I just do not have time for the headache and nonsense .
The folks working there were so lame that i will not even mention the name .
Without hesitation she gave me an amazing number on her first reply with no stupid games !
I do not care about the free water or popcorn , but it 's a nice gesture .
All i want is no games and the car i want at the price i want right away .
Sorry but can not stop there !
I am a big believer in that we all screw up at some point , it just happens , but it 's not the mistake that defines someone .
I have never seen attention to detail like this company has !
I do not normally leave reviews and now you can probably see why .
I would not be surprised if she found one !
You will not be disappointed .
I have never seen anyone get anything they were not happy with .
I thought having dinner at lolo 's would be a good idea since he had never been there .
I have never been let down by the downtown location in all the years i have been eating there .
This is not true lolo 's .
Not a problem since we were there early enough for my boyfriend to eat then catch his flight .
The cashier asked us if we were sure that we did not receive it .
We literally had to show her our receipt and the food we received even though she had just taken our order not even thirty minutes earlier .
She swore they had made it , even though it clearly was not there with our other food , but said she would get another one started .
Fries in the chicken tender basket were also soggy not at all crisp .
The cheese grits were more like cheese soup , just runny and not at all good .
I told him at this point i am not interested in another drink , my concern is the mold growing in their milk bottles .
I explained to bill again that my concern was not to be refunded $ 3.29 , that does not not at all make up for our poor experience , my concern is the milk bottles they are selling have mold growing in them .
At this point i literally had to let bill knows that any idiot with any common sense could clearly see this is mold as it was hairy , white and green , clearly not at all an ink mark , not even close and how insulting .
I literally had to ask him to remove the other milks on the shelves and make sure they were not also moldy .
I can not believe this is how they treat customers or run their business .
It was a cream sauce and not what i was expecting .
I only get pho , the shrimp rolls both with no meat and durian shake it 's the best !!
Can not say the same about the ladies that work there they look soo miserable and bothered all the time .
The place is not very clean as well .. now i just order to go
The foods are good and tastes great but the crew members are not that friendly .
We ordered one big bowl of noodle so that my friend and i can share because my friend will not be able to finish a small bowl of soup and ask if we could have two empty bowls .
Never going back here again .
I have been a mazda owner for half my life and can not seem to give them up !
Not in love with the financing personnel but nothing but positives on dave and all the mazda vehicles at cardinaleway .
Can not believe how much food !
This place is a locals place , but i am not sure how the locals are affording it .
I even bought into the club card -- not that it will ever pay off because i will not be back .
The second reason is service .. our waitress whom we rarely saw was almost rude , slaming things down on the table , no smile , and never came back after bringing the food .
Just a hint , while i am eating my food i do not want to see your freckly boobs or ceasarean scar !
A friend ordered a drink and when he never got it he reminded them and they tried to charge him twice .
She does not smile at all even when we say thank you and she has this smug face almost all the time , except when she serves several other customers ( which i have observed ) .
Most people going to a pub probably will not mind it .
She had not noticed it because she had a terrible cold and could not smell anything !
I am not a huge fan of pho but this place has great pad tai !
We had to wait to be seated even for a weekday lunch , although it was not a long wait .
After sitting at the table for 10 mins , we do not have tea , plate , chopsticks and even menu .
The fish in " water boiled fish " i do not think it 's fresh , should be frozen , so i do not recommend this dish .
Sugar coated sweet potato is good , the sugar coating was not too thick nor too thin , just perfect and the sweet potato itself it 's sweet .
Cumin beef was the worst dish that we just tried a few pieces and do not even think about packing it up .
Did not taste like beef at all , the texture is awful ....... to my standard , this restaurant is not clean enough for dine in , so i have to think about it whether go again just for dumpling ........

I do not expect good service from most chinese establishments but the staff are fast , friendly and wonderful here !
This was my first visit to julep and i was not disappointed .
I love their beef wrap so much that when i am not in toronto i sometimes come back to get some .
Mostly it 's missing pieces of the order , often a full entree is forgotten but of course these items are never forgotten from your bill .
Calling back to say the order you received is incorrect is usually not met with the apologetic , ' how can we fix this ' attitude however .
I received no nothank you ' on a recent pick up , despite my repeated verbal gratitude , but our most recent , and likely final , take out order was an extra large mess up .
Do not even waste your fucking time and money at this place .
Not as high quality as nearby restaurant xiao long bao .
Not as much soup .
It was ridiculously priced and i did not know any better since i was young and idealistic about where i live .
The utility bills are fixed no matter the actual usage .
Also it just does not add up to pay that much .
I could never ever study or sleep because my neighbors ( including people in other units ) would either be having a dance party or having sex .
It was not worth it when you could buy your own stuff and keep it or sell it later .
Sure , within reason , i understand ultimate safety can not be guaranteed .
She did not .
The waitress could clearly see i was not eating my dinner .
Also , the music was soooo loud , we could not carry on a decent conversation .
You just do not play around with your hair and serve food .
The second batch came out and was not fully baked and very doughy .
No powdered crap you typically get at an airport .
This place is overpriced , because there are no other asian restaurants nearby .
I do not know ! ) , and almost $ 10 at lunch ( with yummy salad ) .
The pad thai did not come with a lime wedge and was thin .
The soup ( that comes with the combo ) is not hot enough .
The curry beef is not bad .
When i was in college and did not have a car , the shuttle to campus and close proximity to unlv ( along with being on a main bus line ) made it much easier to commute between school , home , and my internship .
I do not mind spending more when the food is exceptionally good but the prices here just do not match the food quality .
The pork dish was so ordinary and not that tasty .
Needless to say the dinner did not end on a good note with that one and the bill did not help .
Uttapam - not bad not great vadai - hot and crispy outside with a soft inside !
I said i was not interested in other cars they were offering they said " ok bye " .
( btw i have never written a bad review , but i have never had a worse experience than this ... )
I do not know how it compares to other apartments in las vegas , but compared to where i lived before moving to lv it 's really affordable .
I have not seen any fights or public drug use or anything of that nature , which is pretty impressive considering it 's mostly college students .
If you do not make reservation first , you may wait over an hour to be seated during weekend .
Service is not bad .
But i did not think much of the food .
The cornbread , which we shared at the table , was weirdly bouncy , not the densely delicious southern cornbread i was expecting .
It was very dark and intensely crunchy , but not delicious .
But i am not really tempted to go back .
I never had a chance to go to their old location and i am glad i waited for this one .
Went here for the brunch experience and to be honest , it was not bad .
The calamari was not tough .
I have owned 4 businesses and know things can not go right all the time , but this was systematic and will not change .
I was told $ 998.00 exactly , which included a $ 100 a month discount since it was a week before the rush of tenants , making rent $ 499 not $ 599 -- but only if i sign up within two days , and that if i do , we get a $ 1,000 gift card to use anywhere in lv . the alternative apartments were $ 1,300 to move in , so i went for rebel .
It never we nt down , it was a full basin , as i saw when i drove there to move her out .
Late september we were told there was an additional $ 275 they " forgot to add into our move in fees " that covered a year of cable or something , and another hundred for i never could figure out .
Then they tried to charge my daughter a big fee for not having her gate pass key .
I had to remind them that the day they moved in they did not have any , and finally they remembered and gave her the pass key she had asked for for weeks .
So we did not pay september rent , knowing we had $ 1,500 in deposits .
I wrote emails that never got a reply .
They told me that i am responsible for filling her room , not them .
They said that even if people want it , if they are not compatible with the roommates , they are put into a different apartment .
Sounds sweet , but then i asked what percentage of rooms get rented out this way if someone does not live in lv ?
She said she does not know , but " sometimes " it works .
I asked why they do not show it , they said our job is to rent rooms that do not have any rent being paid or deposit . only after our deposit is used up , do they show her room .
They would not fix the sink until it is rented , by the way , saying there is no need to , and said they are not sure about the old crap that still sat in the living room .
Before moving out , my daughter said that every single person she talked to at rebel place " would not move back there " and most had had at least some problem with maintenance or the office .
Btw , we never ever got our $ 1,000 gift card , which they said was delayed indefinitely .
So overall , we lost $ 1500 in deposit , were charged an additional $ 250 after our total was figured , and never got $ 1,000 promised .
Beware , especially foreign students , they know you do not know how to get your money back , or what you can demand from them in health standards .
It happens , not the end of the world and most of the time things go fine .
My best friend who is from vietnam and who is no slouch at cooking swears by this place and i could not agree more .
The soup base is key and though i wish they had fresh noodles , it 's not a deal breaker .
You can try anything else on the menu such as the bun or rice dish and equally will not be disappointed .
Still , no matter .
I saw a car listed online and of course the description did not describe any of the flaws with the vehicle ( i understand this is standard practice in the industry and i am not holding this against them ) .
Being an out - of - state buyer and not being able to do that .
The car had less than 7 k miles and it 's a cpo , so i figured there would not be any major damage , but small ones can be missed and are hard to see in photos .
I do not even do that .
He also mentioned there was " another buyer looking at the car " but since my credit was better , it would be no problem for them to close this deal for me .
Brett set my expectation high with his description of the car but there is no way that this car was " spot on " by anyone 's definition .
" i just do not get ( why you are making such a big deal about this ) "
" it 's such a great deal , even if you paid to have the paint fixed you 'd still come out on top " " we replace windshields every day here in az , it 's normal to have pits like that " " too bad you do not live here , my guy can fix the paint chips for $ 100 " " the hood is aluminum so it will not rust ( even though the chips have gone through the primer ) " " if you are asking me to take anything off the car i can not do it " i never heard the words " i am sorry " during my time there .
I could tell brett was in no position to reduce the price and james ' smug face told me he knew i was a long way from home and that he was going to exploit my circumstance .
I am going to give brett the benefit of the doubt and believe that he simply did not inspect the car as thoroughly as an anal person who cleans his car with a q-tip would .
James gets a solid 0 . the finance manager also wasted my time trying to sell me his extended warranty / service plan and for insinuating i was financially irresponsible not taking him up on his offer .
The servers acted like we were a nuisance and they did not even want us there it took a long time to get our food and the even messed up on the order and still charged full price for it .
The breading was crispy but light not hard , the collards amazing , the butter was salted and delicious and syrup so thick it left trails like glue .
The chicken was super juicy and well seasoned , so that my son hated to put hot sauce on it because he could not taste the seasoning on the chicken .
I guess the lower ratings could be because the waffles were not all that crispy .
Our family loves the boba drinks however their are times when they do not completely cook the boba correctly and it ends up being very hard .
Not the kind of place to order a salad .
Do not get the blue cheese chicken salad and you will be fine .
The sushi is good too , the sashimi on the other hand is not as good as i thought .
I had an eggplant hot pot - nothing great teriyaki beef - weird taste i will definitely go back but not to eat , just to buy frozen fake chicken .
The sushi is fantastic , the flavours are delicate and intricate , we have not had a roll we did not like !
The thai dishes are good as well and there 's a lot on the we have not yet tried because we always order the sushi .
I am not sure how you can complain that there was no fish at a restaurant that is called tenon vegetarian .
The rice was not cooked all the way so i kept getting hard rice chunks , then finally the beans were so watery that i could not eat them with a fork at all .
Do not think i will be going back , the whole meal was bland , and lacking in flavor , but all had the same dirty grease taste to it , and how you get that with a tamale is beyond me .
I did not finish it , and did not save it for left overs .
Had i not purchased it as take out i would have returned it immediately after my 2nd bite , i even considered taking it back to the restaurant and telling them how bad it was .. good to see that other people had good experiences , but i took a chance on a little place and it did not work for me at all !

It 's not meat substitute as some would compare or mock dishes .
Only downside is they are not open super late .
I do not know if it was an off day or the time of day or what the issue was , but i did not like these pretzels .
Decor : you can not help but notice when coming in that this place is the ultimate diner experience at least in terms of decor .
I can not help but marvel at accomplishing such an atmosphere and appreciate it .
I was full but i could not help myself and needed to finish it all .
I had some ... since the waitress not only gave him his milkshake but the excess of the milkshake ( basically 1.5 milkshakes ! )
For this price , you 'd expect excellence but perhaps it was the dean cheese burger but i did not feel i got my value .
Even perhaps a 5 stars if my burger did not impress me .
I waited so long for my waffle i did not have time to send it back .
I ate less than half and did not want to eat any more cold waffle .
She did not offer a resolution .
The place was not overly busy .
Not sure why my food was cold .
Will not be going back .
Do not hold back .
Never again will i ever purchase from this barney 's .
The sales associates have no class or sense of customer service .
2 days later my sales person decides to call me back and lets me know he is still working on it and to let me know he has not forgotten me .
I do not understand the incompetence !!!
It was understood he forgotten me .... not informing him i found the shoes myself i decided to already return the bigger size i purchased from him .
When i arrived he was not in so another gentleman helped me who was unbelievably rude .
He was wondering why i was returning the shoes as if he did not want to help me so i vented my story .
He then says it 's not right that i purchased it through beverly hills because now my original salesperson loses the commission .
If you want to do some real shopping go to la or ny barneys ' not las vegas !!
I walked in at the same time as another couple , sat at the bar and waited while the bartender presented them with menus and made their drinks , never getting an acknowledgement at all .
She looked at the menu multiple times because i do not think she knew how to make the drink and guess what ?
I have wanted to try wi for a while now and just did not get there so now that they are so close , makes it very easy .
I checked the no wait app and there was no wait .
It took a few minutes but it was not bad and once we got to the host stand we were immediately seated .
I have to say , unfortunately our waitress was not good .
Never asked my hubby if he needed a water refill .
Then she brought the check and did not even ask if dessert was in our future .
Thankfully the food was great ( the only reason this gets a 4 and not a 5 , our waitress ) .
I did not even need syrup on it .
The hubby chose the sausage gravy and waffles , double portion which did not look like a double but who are we .
Our waitress was not good .
Last but not least i ended up getting food poisoning from here .
You are better off going to baton rouge and paying the same price for aaa quality burger that will not disappoint .
I can not imagine the post - bar business they could do on carson st .
As it is , you 'd better not get a pretzel craving after 3 pm or you will be out of luck .
3 ) they do not sell chips .
I did not know it was there until i drove past one day .
It is absolutely not a dive .
You can tell they are still working on the remodel / decorating process , but seeing as they have only been open for a couple months and the place already looks so nice , i do not mind .
You do not have to worry about not finishing it all .
They all definitely have their own taste but none of them are over the top , perfect for us folks who are not hardcore bbq aficionados .
No sad , floppy fries there !
This is going to be one of those little hidden gems in the neighborhood , which is great because we really do not have anything else like wheelfish in the area .
This changed the original plans as the tires i wanted were not going to arrive until later that day .
He did not try to up sell me either !
Love this store but did not really find anything i really wanted to plunk down a huge chunk of change on ... sales staff were much more pleasant to talk to than the assholes at neiman marcus .
The last time i was here i had ordered a milkshake with no cherry as i am allergic to them ( which i also said ) , drove up to the window , and was handed a milkshake with a cherry on it .
When i gave it back and let them know it was supposed to no cherry , i watched the cashier through the window pick the cherry out with a napkin and cover up the leftover juice with whipped cream , then give it back to me .
After asking if it had been remade , the guy did not know what to say and did not answer me until i told him it needed to be remade and i had seen him just pick it out with a napkin .
When we asked about it and gave it back to them , the cashier ( who did not apologize ) informed us they would need to charge an additional $ 0.80 for the price difference .
Judging from the other recent yelp reviews , we are not the only people this has happened to .
Unfortunately , that does not explain the numerous mistakes over the two nights in a row i was there .
However , i did not hear him say the name , but my friends did which is why when he asked who ordered it they did not point it to my direction .
I would have eaten the burger if it did not contain two food items i dislike very much : guacamole and mango salsa .
It is rare for me to give such a low rating , but the just a-ok food and all the mistakes means i will not be coming back unless i have to .
Vegetables were also good but not amazing .
They were hot and crunchy and we would have ordered more if we were not so full from everything else !
Last time i stopped and checked the order and with no surprise we were missing a sandwich - i we nt back in and spoke to a manager who was unapologetic and rude demanding a receipt when i had just pulled off the drive through , i explained this is a reoccurring issue and he directed me to the wall to get information if i would like to let the operator know .
The management needs to get it together - do not waste your time go to somewhere that cares about your business .
Because of kevin , the manager here , i will never go to this location again .
They never gave her an invoice , yet the tpms light was still on so she brought it back today to have it fixed .
When i talked to kevin , he told me he could not diagnose the problem with the car not being there .
Frustrated , i told him we have already been there twice and still no answers .
He then lied and told her that he told me he would give me a 40 % discount , not free .
Why would not he have given her an estimate with a dollar amount prior to doing any work if that was the case ?
I made my own burger but found the burger meat has no seasoning at all , just meat made into a patty and cooked .
The fries were not bad but the mac and cheese was not good at all , one bite was enough for me .
Not a big fan of this place .
2 1 / 2 hours later , not only vehicle was not finish , they advised me they put the wrong part and they had to call another branch near by to get this particular part delivered asap .
This would have been a one star review if they did not give me the oil changes .
My dad stole one of my chicken tenders because i could not finish .
Unfortunately they did not have my size in stock , but were able to find them quickly and had them shipped from the scottsdale flagship store .
The employees at this store are very knowledgeable about their brands , but they are extremely nice and chatty - no matter whether or not you are handing over your hard earned cash .
I have eaten at jukebox , since it 's been about a year or two i have not eaten there i have noticed one big thing that changed .
Sadly , i could not think of anywhere else to do .
The burger was by no means 1 / 2 lb of meat .
No ketchup .
Sadly , they were clearly not cooked to order and had been sitting under a heating lamp for quite sometime .
I did not enjoy them .
A bonus point for not being salty !
Clearly filled with dark food colouring since the taste of chocolate simply was not there .
My only reason for giving this place four stars is that the first time i went the staff seemed to not care about their job , maybe it was because friday nights are busy .
My fresca drink was delicious and refreshing - tart but not too much .
Update ( december 2016 ) : note that the ayce options are no longer offered .
They have many options here , not just sushi / japanese , although that 's where the place really shines in my opinion .
I do not come here for the cooked stir - fry stuff , there are plenty a dozen of other chinese vegetarian places whipping up that stuff in the city .
There 's no other japanese vegetarian place in the gta that i know of that does this !
Here , there is no sufficient justification for the higher charge .
Note that dinner does not include any mock sashimi .
Personally , i do not care much for it because i am not really a fan of it -- it 's impressive how much it resembles actual sashimi , but i do not particularly enjoy it .
The staff could not have been any nicer or more welcoming .
It does not have the same effect when an ethnic establishment plays american pop music .
She hooked up my group at xs with no cover and free drinks .
On a monday morning at 9:30 , one would expect that the service would be fast and friendly ; however , this is not what my experience was .
The fruit was not fresh and the strawberry syrup overpowered the whole waffle .
I love that they will not wait on you if you are talking on your cell phone .
Even though the shop is tiny and you can not eat inside , there is always a line to get food .
Sandwiches are no more than $ 3.00 and they have great cookies , muffins and desserts .
Seriously , a couple of slices of meat and cheese between a sliced pretzel never tasted so good .
I had no idea this place even existed .
Not even 5 minutes from my house ...
I visited wheelfish after thanksgiving and i can not wait to go back .
I am not from the area , but was visiting friends and i am glad we chose to go there for dinner and drinks .
It was the best mule i have ever had and i have not been able to find one as good .
I am going to be back to the area soon and can not wait to visit again !
Cooks should not be serving the food too ... has great potential but not with current situation .
They hold together well and are not too thick .
I would come back to try other dishes , but i can not say this is a stand - out place .
Tried it twice , never again !
Plus the atmosphere is nice too edit : only problem is they never seem to be open ... went back many times and they are always closed ....
We did not even know anything about it before walking in .
Not smokey like burnt taste .
Tasted like it had been sitting in a dirty pot that has not been washed .
But it was not .
My tea latte was bland and did not originally have steamed milk in it ( duh that 's what a latte is ! ) my husbands chai tasted like hot water and my kids hot cocoa was just steamed milk with a dribble of cocoa .
Clearly the women working totally did not give a darn because when i asked for milk in my latte she did not even bother to steam it .
We will not be back .
I was dressed down , ( 110 degrees in vegas ) and not a soul would come to me at the counter .
After 5 minutes of looking over at the black booted associate and her buddy chat , i simply walked away , mentioned to one of the men working a tie counter and said -- " those women just lost a commision for ignoring me . " his jaw dropped , ( long - haired asian man , extremely nice ) and said , " please let me walk you over there " to which i replied , " no , i am not going to make such an easy sale for them . "
The plain pretzels were pretty good , not exceptional as they had been sitting there for a while and not warm but at least they were not greasy like some other mall pretzels can be .
We were expecting a family version of bruegger 's bagel or panera , well this place is not as good .
We will not go back and will not recommend it to others .
The bento box is $ 11.99 which is not a bad deal .
Overall , good choice for vegetarian food , not greasy like other chinese vegetarian restaurants .
She even sent us a reminder about where to line up for the guest list to make sure we did not get lost or confused .
I did not get to shop the whole store , but was delighted in our experience in the shoe department .
We have live in chandler , az for 7 years and did not find this jem until this morning .
If you have not yet tried their pretzels i highly recommend .
They have pure honey & they know i am on my way so they never run out .
" never gonna happen " .
So , yes we acknowledge that we damaged the rims , and no we are not going to do anything to make it right .
This was back in 2007 , i have not returned since .
The scratches looked so bad i ended up buying another set of factory wheels that matched them , discount tire would n't even do the swap for me !!!!!
I plan to not do business with any discount tire ever again if i can avoid it , due to this installer 's error but mainly the management 's bad judgement and their callus attitudes .
I wish i had pictures of the wheels and scratches to post here , they were pretty bad , all the way to the metal , not sure what the tire jockey was thinking as he damaged them .
I would not recommend this place , but i am sure that they have changed managers between now and back then , 9 years ago .
The same thing happened at big o tire since then , at least big o accepted fault and stepped up and repaired the rims ..... side note , i have never bought a warranty on any tire since i bought tires at discount and have never needed one .
At least i do not damage my own stuff .
You might not have the bad deal that i got here , either way , good luck !!!!!
I like the brisket a bit moister but it was not their fault .
I have never went anywhere else to buy a tire , but fixing my tire and not charging anything was very helpful to this single mother of three !!
It reminds me a lot of a place you 'd find in town , not the burbs !
The " beef " did not taste like anything that once had hooves , but the curry sauce they used was delicious and more than made up for this .
On a side road a bit north of pittsburgh , you definitely would not expect it .
It was a good mix of the food and music and the music was not so loud that you could not talk .
Yum , not sure what there is not to love about this place .
Actually , this is our go - to place with 2 friends of mine , not entirely sure why , as the food is not amazing or anything , it s more of a tradition thing now i guess .
It was not a problem !
Only thing i was not fond of was my margarita .
Also has a large parking lot in the back so no worries about finding a spot !
2.5 stars a group of 7 of us met up in unionville main st on boxing day and realized that most of the restaurants were not open for lunch that day .
It had cucumber and the tofu skin they use for inarizushi , no avo or eel in sight .
I think this is the wrong one ... " no problem she takes it back to the counter .
It 's hard to judge the food because i have never wished to try vegetarian sushi given the choice of real fish versus some hard jelly that 's made to look and feel like salmon .
To be honest , i did not like it very much .
They tried to tell me i needed 4 new tires when i had not had the tires on my truck for a year yet tread was fine , said they could nt let me leave with my tires in the state they where in , it was unsafe , i just went in for a balance and rotation , i ended up going to another discount tire and they said my tires where fine , i have been buy the same tires for my truck for teh past ten years and never had an issue , i wonder how many other people they tricked into buying tires that did not need them .
Thought i was going to be out $ 230 for a new tire , but steve not only happily got me in right away , but they were able to fix it at no charge !
Can barneys ever not have 5 stars ?
The cl store did not have my size , but barney 's came through !
For me personally , i do not like when staff hovers around me .
With all the negative press regarding treatment of minorities at barneys , i was pleased that i did not experience any negative vibes at any point during the whole selection , try on or purchase .
Do not go .
I have been coming here for some years now and i never leave disappointed .
I can not blame the 2 servers / bartenders but they were just overwhelmed doing the whole place as it was full .
Manager came by and replaced my meal and did not charge me .
It 's a really big place so we never have to wait for lineups or whatsoever .
I can not tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic .
It s not a stellar deal or anything but it s like a once a month or every other month thing for me .
I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand .
Believe me chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure .
Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion , i love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet .
The girl who can not do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story .
The people that own the shop / work at the counter are not the friendliest but the pretzels are worth it and prices are cheap !
I love how spacious the setup is compared to the sf location , and not as crowded .
Sometimes they have items that are not available in other stores .
I remember coming here to purchase a baby blue colored phillip lim pashli that i have not seen at other stores .
They have so many options which i love and we got a whole bottle of syrup so we never ran out which i loved and they have the best waffles here they are so good !
The food was decent .. the waitresses were not very talkative however .. i heard a lot about la unica but i did not see the hype .. maybe i will order something else next time ..

I love how he never tried to push me to buy new tires for the front , he only warned me when i am in the safety zone .
I can not get arrested at the barney 's here in beverly hills !
This restaurant replaced loco lime .... but do nt go in expecting to compare the two because they are not nearly the same .
The chips were not bad .... but they were not hot and fresh like at some other places .
The chips were not bad .... but they were not hot and fresh like at some other places .
They looked pretty good and he had no trouble polishing off his plate .
The res saice was really really spicy .... but not over done .
Not quite sure why other yelpers have been giving it such bad press .
My favorites are the cinnamon sugar and the cheddar jalapeno , but they do not make a bad flavor .
The shop itself is simple ( cash only ) and no frills .... reminiscent of the neighborhood it resides in .
Vegan yummy heaven , great place to take kids for a treat and not feel guilty .
I will not be coming back ever !
The boys that do my air check are always very courteous and do not make you feel like you are hassling them , or wasting their time , or any of that .
But i did not mind .
When he got there no work had been done .
He asked and was told it was all done but when he questioned them the rep said the tire with the leak had an issue and they could not do anything l.
They never called and they led us to believe it was fixed .
We will not be back .
I demand not only good quality , but good value .
So no only was the burrito tiny , but it was missing the extra rice .
Not worth the money .
Not to mention the ice cream sandwiches !
Poor first impression : staff does not seem interested in keeps by clientele happy .
I can not say the options were all that impressive - fats and sugars smothering bread for most of it .
When i finally got to order i asked for a cup of coffee with a shot of peppermint - ok european cup sizes with mediocre coffee overwhelmed by huge shot of peppermint and no offer of creamer .
Certainly better than the service but not necessarily enough to sending be rushing back .
Also , do not forget to hit up the back door in carey way for all of the pretzels that look a little strange , but taste the same as all the others .
Not bad for a vegetarian restaurant .
It 's not easy to replicate sushi or duck / pork using soy , but they pull it off in a fresh and tasty way .
Dined in and got no straws after ordering two drinks and also no napkins .
Will not drive thru service is better i definitely will not dine in again .
I really admire tenon 's creativity in conjuring up vegan dishes disguised as meat , but i would not say it 's something that i would crave often .
I can see how a restaurant like this can be appealing to either vegetarians / vegans who miss the meaty taste and texture and to meat eaters who are wanting to go a healthier route , but this is not for me .
It was really strange eating foods that resembled the taste and texture of sashimi , chicken , and duck after not having it in years !
They use some magic and manage to create plant - based raw fish , is not that insane ?!!
Also if you plan on shopping here , they also have they are own valet so you do not have to walk far .
Can not afford most of the stuff but i did ended up with a pair of jeans that was on sale ...
They are not that helpful .
I wanted a purse that they did not have and just because they did not have it ...
Oh well i am buying my purse and it will not be at the barneys :)
This is basically as good as it gets for a pretzel shop and that 's not a bad thing !
My only complain is that the vegas 's barney 's is not quite as large as the ones in la , sf and nyc .
I would not visit it again .
But the flavor was not there and very bland .
The location just looks suspect and just not what i was expecting .
The chimichanga was not cooked well enough and the dough was still pretty doughy inside .
The guacamole was simple with no flavor .
Note : do not have chance to try other stuffs tho .. can not get away from their steak ..
Note : do not have chance to try other stuffs tho .. can not get away from their steak ..
The servers were attentive and friendly , but they did not really change anything from the previous mexican restaurant .
Do not know that we will be back with much better mexican options nearby on central .
I have never had a dish that disappointed me .
I always use the nowait app and never have a problem getting seated .
The key to a good experience is figuring out how to hold the sandwich so that the contents do not fall out .
The cook did not even bother getting the patty all on the bun , but just slapped everything together in a sloppy , careless mess .
The bun was plain , untoasted and there was no tomato ( there was supposed to be ) .
Manager did not even come out to apologize , our server did not even apologize and gave zero care .
Someone is going to get sick ... will not be going back to waffles inc.
You can not find caldo at many mexican restaurants .
Drinks : regular american fountain drinks , and also available are mexican drinks ( including fantas and mexican coke !! mmmmm ) not a lot of seating , but there 's usually not very many people eating in .
( i did not even see that they had capri suns available ;) )
The service easily exceeded my expectations and did not cost me anything but my time .
They always respond to your text within minutes and no issues getting in .
Listen , not 5 stars since i must venture over to the strip .
It 's not overly packed with people and / or merchandise which is a plus for myself .
They were able to get my tire in next day but they did not carefully install the tire on my beautiful wheel .
I have a bend the wheel rim and 3 scratches that are not repairable .
Honestly i am just going to start driving the 20 minutes to the deer valley location because between this stupid shit , last time i did not get my fries and paid for them ( with no return phone call from the manager ) , and the terrible attitudes from the children that work there ( i thought maybe i was being petty but apparently this is a thing here ) ...
Btw , it 's been 2 years and never heard anything from corporate or the store .
They just do not care about customer service .
They have not address the issue of being profiled .
I love the fact you can check in with the no wait app , limits the amount of time you have to wait for a table .
What 's not to love about this store ?
This is exactly what this area needed since there are a ton of chain restaurants and i am not a big fan of chains .
The menu is simple and i honestly did not mind it being that way .
Everyone , go try wheelfish you will not be disappointed !
You will not be disappointed !
Aside from breaking a lug stud making me late to get out of town on a road trip ( pulling a camper , not willing to risk with a broken stud ) these guys were great .
They quickly fixed the issue , but had my office not been close by i would not have been happy to spend time there twice for what should have been done the first time .
They give you a lot of fries but they are not the best .
I was not able to finish mine .
Since a repair did not hold from another store they are replacing my tire with brand new one for free .
You will not be disappointed .
Not ayce resto but quite impressed with the food !
I am not a vegan myself but decided to give it a go since my friend could not eat meat on good friday .
You will not be disappointed :)
You can have the best food in town but if you can not it right or hot or in a timely manner then i will go find someone who will get me mediocre food like i want it .
The staff does not follow proper sanitary guidelines when washing dishes and preparing food .
Hmm , big mistake , you should treat all customers equally and not judge customers by appearance .
While it 's not the place to go for anything healthy the salads are very good and generous in size .
Almost as a warning " why are you eating the grilled chicken " it just is not the place to order this item .
We have not gotten too adventurous ( as have some other reviewers ) but i can attest to the deliciousness of the menudo ( red ) , carnitas , carne asada , caldo de res and caldo de pollo .
The atmosphere - it 's a real small place with no frills .
I can not say enough good things about this restaurant .
Is this way u run a successful franchise with bunch of folks who does not know how to run the process flow for delivering a simple order .
Got to drive back again and change my order ... staff inside have no clue how this happened and they apologize just because they got to say something .
Bunch of lazy folks with no focus on customer service are running this location .
I love that everything on the menu is vegan & you do not have to worry about substitutes or asking for anything special .
I did not realize they were closing so soon ( 5 pm , we got there at 4 ) i would have loved to be able to linger around & had some more beer or finished with a coffee but we did not want to be a bother to the sweet waitress .
The food is not the best in town but value for money is excellent .
It does not get much better than that .
This place is your standard mexican it 's no pacos or cantina , but it 's good !
Starting out , the salsa is fresh and they give you mild and spicy - can not complain with that .
Last week , i split the ' no name ' meal and it was enough food for both of us .
I just hope the word does not spread too much about this place , but they deserve more business , so i will do my yelp duty and give them a deserved review .
We have been there regularly and never had this experience .
But unfortunately we will not be going there again nor recommending it like i used to .
Such a shame , their food was really good , but not worth it if they have chosen to lower their quality of food .
You can get a full lunch for $ 3.25 - like the fresh pretzel with parm as well as the plain - not a fan of the cookie and other baked good but other seem to buy them .
Sandwiches had minimal sauce and no extra side of sauce .
This location was able to take care of me even though i did not have an appointment and they were about to close .
I was in and out in no time .
I would have liked to give three and a half stars but that does not seem to be an option .
I waited 3.5 hours on saturday for them to change my tire and they said it was done , then charged me $ 200 and not one thing changed on my car the same tires were still on there !!!
I could not ask for better .
This is the only car place that has not tried adding more to my bill .
Not just once but everytime i go there the gentleman is always looking out for me and not how much more they can get cause im a woman .
They do not try to sell me anything that is not needed .
Mashed potatoes contained absolutely no seasoning whatsoever , the fries were seriously undercooked ( borderline raw ) and for what you get , it seems very overpriced .
While the hostess ( brown / red hair and freckles ) could not have guessed that , the eye rolling and annoyed attitude should not have been present .
The food was great , but the waffles have significantly reduced in size , and the lack of service ( my friend 's husband never did get his water ) made me realize that this place is not worth visiting again .
The xs night swim at encore was by far the most fun i have ever had and i had absolutely no problems getting thanks to michelle putting me on her vip guest list !
It 's not too expensive .
First time here , but definitely not the last !
12 piece ... the 8 will not be enough .
Only problem is there hours and they do not take a card
Not too much to hate on .
If in this area , i will not go here on a normal basis , as i do like the other places i mentioned above .
I certainly do not need some weird shrimp dish or something with a super rich cream sauce .
Service is friendly , food is good enough , you just will not find me at this location very often .
The place is always busy but these guys hustle you in and out .. the ease of making an appointment online is great .. you just have to be prepared for the unexpected rush but never a dull moment with other stores around to see while you wait
I am not thrilled with the prices but sometimes you just have to treat yourself to the finer things in life lol .
We kept trying to get someone 's attention to get our check and when we finally did we had our money out to pay she just dropped the check and did not come back for ten minutes .
It was about 8:30 on a tuesday and it did not seem like they were very busy so i am not sure why it took so long .
Aside from the fact one menu item was described as ' spicy ' and was not even mildly spicy .
I know that they are still in their early stages of opening so i may give them another chance in a few months but i will not be returning any time soon .
My husband and i shared the chicken ( moist & delicious with the skin ) , smoked beef brisket ( delicious , brought to you dry & they have multiple sauces they bring to you that you can put on - i did not care for the sauces , but my husband did like the cowboy ) , delicious sweet potato fries & the corn muffin ( my husband loved it .
You do not get a lot of brisket ( small portion ) , but do get a lot of chicken ( small portion ) .
When the chicken first came it was not cooked enough .
My grandkids had french toast , came out with no syrup .
Will not return .
I am not sure about last time but they did not take reservations but the wait for a table was not that bad considering they were packed .
We have never had a bad meal or experience .
No frills here , just some cheap mexican food that hits the spot .
Tenon vegetarian cuisine is not a bad choice if you dine with your vegetarian friends ...
There are a great selections of japanese , chinese and thai items on the menu to choose from , hopeful you will find something that everyone will enjoy . but if you are dining alone or you just not into sharing , at least they have bento boxes you can choose from .
15 % specials so at least i am not paying full price .
Lunch specials till 3 pm but no extra discount ... what ?!!
The lady who answered the phone was very rude and kept putting me on hold , not completing my order .
Unfortunately the service is not
Since i 'd found the flyer on line , i had already made plans to just grab tacos and meet up with someone else after , so we could not dine - in this particular day .
I know it is not always great to have to discount something , but if they would have handled the situation differently , they could have made a patron for life out of my friends and i.
Food is just too good not to keep trying all the menu items .
I was not impressed with the food , but i got the eggplant , not meat .
When you were in the bar area you were not able to hear the singer which is insane for how small the place is .
How did i not write a review for this yet ?
Unfortunately i made the appointment at the wrong location , but when she arrived they fit her in to the schedule with no fuss and minimal disruption .
Do not go when you are in a hurry .
This chickfila needs some help with speed and accuracy , it is not run like all the other chickfila's that i have visited through the years
I can not believe i just recently found this place .
Have not been here in a while and boy did the food take a turn for the worst .
The burger was over cooked and dry / tasteless i had to drench it in ketchup and a bit of mustard to be able to eat it ... spoilers i did not finish it .
As for service our waiter was ok had a few jokes but no drink refills or anything like that .
There was a ton of kids tonight and they were playing with the jukebox , could not really hear the music but stuff like that does not bother me for those who are allergic to kids beware .
I do not go here as often as i used to , which is a shame .
They are both tasty faves and i never had one of either that i felt was not up to scratch .
I have never seen the pretzel shop not busy .
The restaurant does not look like much from outside but inside , it 's a whole different vibe and it really makes for a good time .
Service was not the best that 's why i gave 4 instead of 5 stars - but the food was really good .
I had the hot rod and the wife had the gleason which she could not finish - i was happy to help !
Do not get the gleason unless you are pretty hungry !
For the people who think it is overpriced / expensive - get real - this is a restaurant , not mcdonalds .
The only slight complaint i would have was the service was ok but not great - they had baby chairs but did not offer it even though i was holding a baby , so i went and got it myself , and they could not substitute our kids ice cream for a small milkshake because they only have one size ... so we got the shake anyhow ... and boy am i glad we did ... delicious !
You have not had a coke until you have had one made with real sugar , let me assure you .
The chicken was some of the most tender chicken i have ever had , no joke .
But , they seemed to genuinely want to make their customers happy , so i would not be surprised to see the same level of service when it 's busy either .
I had no idea a waffles incaffeinated was coming to the wexford area .
I have never been to one before but i have heard of it .
I did not go that day but told myself to try it soon .
It was not too busy so we sat down right away .
Also their fresh homemade salsa can not be beat .
They have been cool enough to plug tires i did not buy at discount tire for free - this is when i became a loyal customer and always shop this brand .
It all looked pretty good whenever it was delivered to the table with my only concern being the fact that the chicken was still on the bone which i do not like .
My least favorite main dish of the night ended up being the smoked eggplant which while good and certainly the most innovative was not completely my cup of tea .
Cool blue walls might be fine in summer but not fall and winter .
They are not insulated either , our coffee was never hot .
3 eggs instead of 2 . the continental breakfast does not have an add waffle option .
The oj was watered down , not fresh they brush your waffle with butter , i 'd rather do it myself the food is presented nicely , very nicely .
My friend told the waitress she does not like oniond but the dish she suggested was filled with them .
What 's not to love about chik - fil - a?
I appreciate that they are closed on sundays and holidays so their staff can spend time with their families , however , so i do not mind one bit .
The only " complaint " i have is when i am craving them on sundays , they are not open !
After a long day at work and did not feel like cooking dinner so i decided to pick up some chick - fil - a on my way home .
I clearly noticed i had someone else 's order because it was not even close to mine .
I told her i did not need the change and asked if i could get a brownie to make up the difference they owed me + the hassle .
Since i have yet to eat at any chick - fil - a because my pride do not let me give a single penny to that company .
Who says vegans can not have sashimi !
First let me say the entrance to this place is not clear at all .
Ok note to self not the entrance .
I am sorry , but there is no reason for such confusion with the entry way !
I had avoided the parking lot behind the place because of other reviews stating how precarious the driving situation could be back there , so i did not see the patios til after the fact .
Specifically inquired how the lengua was cut before hand was told it was thinly sliced and of course it came out diced -.-. barbacoa had no flavor other than oil it definitely needed seasoning .
The community water jug was not flowing so i opened it hoping it was fruit or something , i was surprised to see hair inside the jug & what looked like pieces of napkin in it .
Personally , i do not think that is sanitary .
What 's worse when i let the person working there know she first just made sure there was water in the container and it does not appear to get checked in the inside .
When i let her know what was inside she took the water away , but it was not replaced and i did not get to drink any water with my meal .
I have never been a big waffles person .
( no to pancakes too ) but - being that i was at a waffle place - i felt like it was inevitable that i get waffles .
While i did not finish my waffles - i did finish the scrumptious berries !
They were not busy - granted it was a monday .
The sushi does not really taste like sushi but it is interesting to try , it 's kind of chewy .
Can not even tell that it 's not real .
Also had the sweet and sour eel , it 's interesting , not bad but nothing amazing like the teriyaki .
I would not get the eel again if i go back
She asked us where we would prefer to sit which i really appreciated we did sit pretty close to the live band but i did not mind and they were great !
Another great thing was that the chef brought out a dish for us to try not sure what it was but it was great !
Can not wait to return !!!
I have never liked cheese , not even vegan cheese , so this option did not appeal to me .
The fried " chicken " is not at all what i expected ; it was more like chicken nuggets .
The greens were not southern greens , but they gave it a nice try .
I never see them advertising cupcakes on their social media pages anymore , so i am not sure what happened .
I do not know if they still offer this lovely entertainment .
They also offer bagel sandwiches for breakfast , which i have never tried .
I do not drink coffee , not a bagel fan , and i do not eat cheese , so unfortunately , there is nothing to draw me here any longer .
I do not know tires very well , but it looks like a better tire than the original .
I believe her name was sylvia ... what a great person . we do not have this restaurant where we ar from ..... we are very impressed .
Expecting their menu to expand but hopefully not too much !
Lol ( not paid for saying that ) .
Each time i end up to jukebox , i always tell myself i will get a milkshake ... due to the size of the food and how delicious they are ... i never got the chance to try .
This location is very busy but they are my first choice over other locations in gilbert / chandler / tempe they are customers friendly , they do not try to over sell you and even when i had an issue with my tires not wearing correctly , they worked with me to exchange them out for tires that are performing to my satisfaction .
I do not care for most of the pretzel places from around town but this place is amazing !
That said , i do not really care for this location .
Also , no way to refill your soda on your own .
Definitely no resemblance to the promotional photographs !
" they make bigger quantities in advance at lunchtime and the food then is never as good . " hmm. makes some sense , i guess .
I will not be going back .
Never had a bad on here .
Also , occasionally get a sandwich and this one did not disappoint .
Do not be fooled by the rough exterior as the inside is the inside is very clean and nicely decorated with colorful mexican tile .
Your food will also be delivered on a real plate - not wrapped in paper or in a styrofoam box like many of the other area taco shops .
I am normally not a huge fan of ceviche however i really enjoy mucho taco 's ceviche tostada .
My only complaints with mucho taco are that the taquitos are a little small and that al pastor is not available in a burrito ( only tacos and tortas ) .
He did not work in the men 's department , but he helped me make a clothing decision and seemed so personable without being pushy .
I am not a huge sweet person for breakfast , but i do love chocolate chips in my pancakes and the funky monkey waffle sounded amazing !
I ended up going with the chicken and waffles instead since this is not too popular a dish in the pittsburgh area .
Even though all of their food is vegan it 's not something they make a big deal about .
They have great sandwiches , try the " toast of the town " for breakfast or the philly for lunch , i can not believe there 's no meat in it .
I felt horrible adding so many people last minute because my friends can not make up their minds but michelle was awesome and understanding !
Went for taco tuesday ( 1 $ tacos ) and the food was pretty good and came out fast but overall was not that special .
I can not wait to come back !
Unfortunately , the las vegas location did not live up to the customer service standards that i always experienced with the flagship location .
In fact , the only reason i am giving it that second star is because the sales associates in women 's clothing were not rude .
They also never acknowledged me , but not nearly as bad as the firs floor beauty area .
Making my way over , no one said hello , which was fine as i had earbuds in .
Normally if someone sees you with headphones , they kind of respect that you do not want to be bothered .
Unfortunately that was not the case here .
At this point , i am beyond frustrated , so i let her know that i do not need any assistance and actually walk away from the counter .
I can not wait to try the many other options that are available .
I do not know what brand of coffee they serve but i seriously love it .
Always a decent selection of cool , casual clothes , although i wish they had bigger shoe selection like in bh but the sales associates seem friendlier and it s not as crowded .
My saturday errand - runs just would not be complete without stopping here .
I always make sure to bring bobby a sandwich home for after work because he can not miss out - it 's not fair !
We do not even care that we have to sit on a random person 's stoop for 2 min to scarf it down ;)
I go to many locations , never seen one that makes mcdonald 's seem clean .
Had to ask for sauces , never at any other location .
I will not return to this location ever .
They have a wide variety of tires available , and can order anything they do not have .
They also offer a sort of insurance ( i do not want to call it a warranty because you have to pay for it ) .
The only bummer is that they do not offer nitrogen .
I thought what a fun looking diner , can not believe it 's not in the usa !
Do not be scared by the long lines , it gets packed on weekends but we did not have to wait more than ten minutes and we were a group of 5 .
The chili nachos were the cheesiest and meatiest i have ever had - plus they serve guacamole at no extra charge .
You just can not go wrong .
I went all out , and was so full i could not find room for dessert but if you are going as a group and want ice cream they offer this mega platter served in a sink ( yes ! )
I was heartbroken , devastated , he kept on huging me and telling me that everything was fine but to me it was not fine , i failed , i really wanted to get it right and i did nt ... after done crying ( i was also very very tired ) we decided to go together at the barney 's palazzo las vegas to try to exange those pradas sneakers for something that he would actually like and wear .
Cause what is the point of buying that kind of gift in the first place if it s gon na stay in the closet and never see the light of day ( or in our case , the lights of clubs ) i did nt had much hopes of exanging that particular item , cause the price , because i baught it in a different state and because barney 's las vegas did nt had this particular item , not even carry prada shoes for men !!!
They carry great cosmetic brands such as khiels , cle de peau , chantecaille and of course chanel and many more great , not your everyday , brands .
I can not wait to come back when im in town .
My group need to add more people day of literally a couple hours before heading to the club and she was still able to edit my guest list without any problems hit her up , you will not regret it !
I have had it occur in another restaurant but i am not quite comfortable with it .
I have had horrible service by 2 chevy dealerships in the recent past so did not even bother calling them .
My problem was resolved in a timely and efficient matter and jose and the gentleman who plugged my tire and tended to my car ( sorry i did not get his name ) were outright awesome .
The grilled cheese was fine but not super gooey and the bread was fairly crisp .
This is not really the eye - opening place that will convert nonvegans to vegans but it was okay .
I checked in with the nowait app , which has recently partnered with yelp , but when we got there , the hostess reported that it had not registered me as checked in .
I never knew this before !
It just does not get any better than this .
No matter , the friendly associates in the cosmetics section took me upstairs via elevator and led me to joe , who took excellent care of me .
I can not wait to come back .
Not crazy for the grilled bites as there are too few for the price .
However , that s never turned off from enjoying my time there .
Anyway , i started to think " i hope this is not one of those places that are weird to you if you are not a regular . " but before i could even finish the thought , the head chef says " hey welcome to wheelfish ! " then the hostess gave us options of where we 'd like to sit ... wow such a small gesture really goes a long way .
Have not felt this special since my 8th birthday but i will take it .
We get seated really close to the live band , which would usually bother me but it did not at all .
The waitress was perfect - friendly but not too much and the service was excellent overall .
I did not think the second coming of jesus would be in the form of a quesadilla but i was very , very wrong .
No idea what it was but i ate it and it was great .
I just spoke with phillip williams in the cash office and i have never been treated so nicely in my life .
We went to xs to see avicii , and not only did we barely have to wait in line , but we got 3 comp drink tickets each .
She did not wait for me to text her , she was on point every day asking if we would like pool cabanas or entry to pool day parties at a variety of different hotels , and asking where we wanted to be set up every night .
No wonder no one wants to spend money there .
Never again .
We arrived on monday night and realized we were the only ones in the restaurant ( never a good sign ) .
Let me break down our experience : margaritas : the jalapeño did not have much kick to it , but it was drinkable .
Needless to say it tasted like coconut water , so they definitely did not get it right .
We ordered the cheese dip , which was pretty good but again could not take down anymore of the extremely greased - up chips .
We ordered the steak quesadilla and no lie , within 2 minutes we received it from the kitchen .
The cheese was not even melted inside and it was extremely small ( was also not cut ) . service - our waitress was really nice , but it was interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar , chatting and on their phones .
We will never be back here .
I hate to be a pessimist , but i can not imagine this place will stay open very long .
I like their original chicken sandwich and the fact that their fries are not overloaded with salt .
Burger is good maybe better than good but not outstanding .
Staff got it right just attentive enough but not too much .
I can see why poutine is popular here no one knows how to make correct fries here .
It was really cheap , but just did not do anything for me when i got the pizza sandwich on a pretzel , of course .
Not very impressive .
Can not wait to come back !!!!
Have been coming here for years and never disappointed .
Delicious creative menu that you are not likely to make at home with amazing specialty syrups ( we get every one for different bites ) !
The service was good and the atmosphere was good ; i do not think i will be returning though .
I really do not know where else one can find perfect ( not the greasy mall kind ) pretzels for 50 ¢ a piece .
Since pretzels are one of the few things i can never get sick of , i do not know what i 'd do without this place .
The only slight problem i have with the pretzel shop is the hours , as they never stay open past six o clock .
Other than that , i see no reason why any pretzel lover would avoid this place .
I did not give 5 stars because we were slightly disappoint in the under cooked fries and chicken nuggets .
She instead lowers the blind so we are not blinded by the sun .
After a five minutes of the sun beating the back of my husbands head and no waiter coming to see us we flag down the hostess as she seats someone else .
It did not take long for us to get our food but upon inspection of my fries ( my inspection i literally mean looking at them ) you could see that the fries which were supposed to be " curly " are limp , cold , and undercooked .
My husband was not too impressed with his food either but his thoughts on the dipping sauces with the fries was " store bought " and the onion rings tasted frozen .
I will not be back .
Everything looked good but was just very bland .. the iced tea was very good but if you are looking for any kind of non surger sweetener you will need to bring your own , they do not offer it ..
The server did not apologize once .
Everybody at the table ordered toast and they did not pre-butter it .
No problem , so we asked for butter .
I almost never give bad reviews but this was just horrible .
Bigger does not always mean better .
Do not get me wrong : the burgers were not bad .
Not by a long shot .
We do not need a burger , however , that casts a shadow over your dinner guest ..... or do we ???
The burger itself was good - not great .
Not worth going out of your way for .
I do not normally like ' breakfast potatoes ' , but they take it to a whole new level and i love them !
I am not sure what i love about this place .
Having been a vegetarian for years but never having tried vegan sushi , i was excited to try .
I was not disappointed !
They carry the high end shoe releases most of the time like the pharrell adidas collection and there never is huge lines .
If you need a outfit for a night on the town and you go in understanding that the top fashion names are supplied here so it will not be cheap then barney 's will definitely meet your expectations .
When i want to make sure that i will not be wearing the same thing as anyone else or i just feel like splurging a bit you can find me on level 3 getting fitted for something new .
Also they always have a lot of staff even when the store is not busy and since it 's a high end retailer the staff is very friendly and accommodating bonus : they also have a huge sale going on right now , up to 40 % off
There has never been a club they can not get us into .
Just to name a few day clubs ; encore beach club , wet republic and marquee day club . for that wild night life we have been on the guest list multiple times for omnia , hakkasan , surrender , xs and marquee . never an issue dealing with viva las guest list .
It took way to long to get our drinks , foods , and checks and it was not even crowded .
The food was greasy and clearly not well made .
Okay , i know i should not have ordered nachos for lunch .
Not only do they have awesome pretzels , but they make really good sandwiches as well .
I was not that happy that they did not have either goodyear or general for my '95 ford explorer , but he found something comparable , a pathfinder .
The place was clean and no real issues .
Not sure if dustin was the guy that put the tire on , but it looks good .
I told jesse i did not want the air pressure in my other 3 tires changed , and dustin honored this .
Though they got the mileage wrong on the receipt and did not have the tires i wanted , i am still giving them 5 stars .
We had some great vegetarian food here - could not believe how good the spicy ' salmon ' sushi was ... incredible flavours ... portion sizes are small and the menu is expensive so will probably come for the odd sushi fix but will not be a regular
The hours are not accurate on yelp or maybe they vary .
We walked in and contemplated the menu ... asked what a toddy was and was very put off by the response ... like we were dumb for not knowing ... the cashier / barista was not very welcoming and did not seem to want us there ... we persisted ... or tried ... we waited for our coffee and tea , sat down in the couched area but left soon after we got our drinks .
The space seemed nice enough , imagine it could be comfortable , just not this time , not for us .
The coffee was not spectacular , not good enough to brace the awkwardness .
She was so great and got me and my friends including guys in to xs with no cover !
If the house margarita does not do it for you , i highly recommend the jalapeño margarita if you can handle the spice .
No call back .
Called again , no mgr available .
No call back .
Filled out survey saying it was never resolved .
No call back .
They do not care about their customers obviously .
I tried 5 times now , with not one call back .
Not cool .
That might get you through on a tuesday , but saturday morning during brunch time you are basically turning away customers who will never come back given the plethora of options .
When i did not find anything perfect to buy , i decided to get some makeup .
The problem was not with this girl , but with the old woman representing a skincare line on the barneys floor .
I know that the vegas economy pretty much depends on getting people to make bad decisions about money , but should not that shit stay on the casino floor ?
When i said i could not afford $ 190 moisturizer , i did not mean i did not have $ 190 in my bank account -- i meant that my current lifestyle does not accommodate $ 190 moisturizer and all the other shit that would come before i bought $ 190 moisturizer .
I felt pretty confident about declining to open up a credit card , but i hope that never works on anyone .
But do not open up a credit card to buy mysterious creams and serums .
Hmmm ... it honestly was not what i was expected and that 's a good thing .
Just remember to bring cash because they do not take cards !
I am not even vegan and i enjoyed the philly sandwich .
Not just because of the large portions but because the food is spectacular .
The prices have gone up over the years , but not enough to truly deter people , i do not believe .
They easily have the best sweet tea out of any place i have ever been to , and am proud to say that i will never stop going to chick - fil - a!
After the 4th visit today , the drive - thru team is rushed and impersonal and does not care to listen to what we ask for .
They have messed up 2 out of the 4 orders , and they do not take the time to make sure it 's right .
When i asked for additional sauce they say oh it 's in there , when in fact it 's not .
The live music started at 8 pm and added a nice background and they adjusted the volume to ensure people were not being blasted out but could hear her .
The server also brought out fries which are optional with the tortas except i did not order them but was still charged .
What to do on super bowl sunday when the steelers are not in it ?
We checked the no wait to see if there was a wait - but there was not so we were able to get seated right away .
We arrived around 1:45 pm and they are open until 3 pm - so it was not too busy and nice and quiet .
The cappuccino was mostly milk , not even drinkable , blueberries used in waffle were likely canned .
Eggs and tomatoes were tasty , but not worth the hassles .
They gave us coupons for free meals at the end because it was such a disaster , but we will not go back .
Also be aware that there is no diaper changing station .
We paid no cover , and had a great time !
We have a promoter ... work with michelle and you will not be disappointed !
This is the second time we have reached out to michelle and never been unsatisfied .
They did not have the tire i needed but ordered it that same day , and informed me that they should have it in by monday .
Even though it was a small place and busy , we did not have to wait very long ( thanks to the no wait ap ) .
Her egg whites were a little runny in the middle , but she did not have the opportunity to send them back because our waitress never came by to ask how everything was .
Also , i do not think the double fruit was really two orders .
We may go back , but would not make a special trip to do so .
My sister and i were really excited to try volstead because it 's another of the highly rated spots in downtown mesa , but i can not say this has been my favorite in the area .
It 's a cute place , but we were not crazy about the food .
To be honest , i did not think it was anything special .
It was too cheesy for me , with very few green chilies , and i can not say i even noticed the mayo .
It 's very quiet and not too crowded , and they have free wifi .
Though i have a ' 95 ford explorer and they will not put the tire pressure to what i want , that is my only issue , but i can see from their point - of - view and will not ding them on stars for this .
The ribs did not fall off the bone .
I do not think there are truly enough adjectives to describe this place .
A pretzel sandwich with real ham , not lunch meat ham , i am talking easter sunday ham .
Just make sure you take cash since they do not take credit / debit cards .
I live so close and kind of mad at myself for not stopping by sooner !
We had a bunch of people with us and they were prompt and did not get a single order wrong .
My fiancé waited an additional hour and a half and they told him that the tire was unrepairable and that we would have to purchase another tire but they did not have any in stock .
Big 'o tires explained that the hole had already been repaired and they checked to make sure it was not leaking .
It was not .
So , discount tire lied , told us the tire was unrepairable ( even though they repaired it ) and tried to sell us a tire for no reason when we have all new tires .
We will never return to this location !
When i was there , i have noticed that the restaurant had the word " vegan " , plastered on placemats , posters ... etc. ( which i thought was quite deceiving , because this is not a vegan restaurant ) .
They use actual dairy dressings , for their salads , the wontons there contain eggs , and the spicy mayo topping ( for sushi ) is not vegan as well .
I stopped by yesterday afternoon , and the store was not open .
The yelp app showed that they were open till 8 pm , but they were not , so i ended up going to worth take out instead .
I have used discount tire for years and this is another reason why i will not go anywhere else .
They also offer a selection of pretzel sandwiches and pepperoni rolls that are not too bad either .
Not the fanciest location , so put on your work boots and do not miss out .
Whenever i am in vegas i hit her up and she never fails me .
Also got mad about the fact that they do not put ketchup or mustard in his burger and that he had to do that himself with the bottles in front of him .
Great place , good nasty food , pricier than regular boring burger joints with no concept .
One negative note is the music was not loud enough and at 7h30 pm they put the hockey game on with the audio which just killed the whole vibe !
This is not a place i would put on my favorite list too pricey for the less than acceptable service .
I will not return not worth the aggravation .
I can not rate these guys past their drip coffee and maybe 1 of their confections ... but it smells delicious .
Not too sweet - i hate that !
I have had the pleasure of both dining in and ordering togo and i really do not have any complaints .
Called the restaurant and they would not acknowledge their mistake .
Asked to speak to manager and they would not connect us .
I added a side of beans ... please do not think think i am a loon but these beans are so freaking delicious !!!
Refried beans ... topped with cheese and not made with lard ( yuck ) .
My bf got the cheese enchilada combo ... also yummy but not as fantastic as my order .
Do not ever go to a " mexican " chain restaurant again ... just come here and wait a few minutes for a fantastic meal .
Not for carryout , which is a bummer if you are in a hurry .
Not very crowded during the week .
Even though it was a small place and busy , we did not have to wait very long ( thanks to the no wait ap ) .
Her egg whites were a little runny in the middle , but she did not have the opportunity to send them back because our waitress never came by to ask how everything was .
Also , i do not think the double fruit was really two orders .
We may go back , but would not make a special trip to do so .
Run do not walk to this local gem !!!
This job is not hard !
Not hard to read !
I did not know much about guest lists and how amazing they can be for a vegas trip until my friend told me about an experience she had a while back ..
The sa remembered me , was less than friendly , told me that they can not give out bags w/o a purchase , wtf !??!
I have been going there for the past 8 years ( since before they went vegetarian ) and have never been disappointed by the food .
The men at discount tires never let me leave if my tires are in an unsafe state !
The sales woman was not helpful at all .
It 's not like i walked into the store wearing sweats or something !
Too bad for her , i did not buy the bag .
I had the pulled pork sandwich with nappa cabbage and bbq sauce , mac n cheese , and the not your mexican mule .
It was not too loud so you could still hold a conversation with the table .
I did not even know such a thing existed !
Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations .
I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which really was not bad , however the sandwiches are premade and i am pretty sure the chicken was just a frozen patty .
I know it was cinco de mayo , however this is the third time i have been here and it is never " decent " service .
I will never come again and i would not recommend anyone coming .
The staff is extremely friendly and there is never a wait !
Although the selections here are small and not quite as large as the new york store it is not hard for me to spend all day in here .
I am not in mesa often , but i will always make a point to stop in to volstead !
I spoke with who ever the " manager " was at this location more than 5 years ago about a large ladder being stored on top of the area small children play in and apparently it is still not a safety concern to this restaurant .
Located in a small strip mall with a small parking lot we were thrilled to find out there was no wait for a table for two .
I personally did not like it , too strong for me .
Should have drizzled some maple syrup on top but did not think of it until it was too late .
Unfortunately , it did not meet our expectations .
My husband and i were not impressed with the food .
I hate bad service ( especially when you have to beg for drinks like we did ) , but there is no reason to go back when the food is average .
I ordered the southern breakfast ( waffle stuffed ( or should i say contains a tiny bit of ) with chorizo ( mexican sausage , which i normally love , but it did not taste like chorizo at all so just call it sausage ) and an egg .
Everyone raved about it ( and he normally loves it ) , but did not agree .
They were very good ( a little too salty ) , but not enough to bring us back .
Just contacted them and they did not seem interested in me at all .
Guess i did not get to michelle lmao !!!
I can not believe that people work so hard but it 's refreshing .
The onions ring were very good but were battered and not breaded .
Music was not too loud .
They did have tv 's everywhere just in case you did not want to miss the game .
They have a massive dining area , and i am not sure how long the wait is for a table during busy time .
They have over sized booths which are nice , but the floor under my seat was sticky , as if they were not mopped after a spill .
There was no hostess at the front or they were somewhere else .
I am not sure where he went , but we had to call another waiter to take our order .
The place was not packed , maybe 3 or 4 large groups and a few smaller tables .
I do not know if there is some kind of rule at this place where you serve the tables your are assigned , that is not right .
I have never been to a diner style restaurant with such a big menu .
There is also 9 types of mac and cheese , 10 types of poutine , and do not forget their hot dogs , sandwiches , salads and appetizers .
The milkshake was not bad either .
3.5 / 5 stars price : this place is not bad priced .
Considering a poutine burger was $ 14.45 , i do not think i can get a quality burger with a poutine on the side for less than $ 15 .
Not bad at all .
Intolerable ; we could not have a conversation .
Not worth the money .
There is no meat served here , and only a few fish options , so my vegan girlfriend was very happy with the selection .
The spicy salmon roll was not made with the small chunks of salmon and mixed with spicy mayo as other places .
I will not comment on the filling of the roll as i strongly prefer really seafood .
I made an appointment online so i did not have to wait when i got there .
I recommend making an appointment online because then you do not have to wait so long once you get there .
I do not understand for the life of me why people would be willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle ... that 's why i waited a few months after opening before i decided to give this place a try .
My wife and i arrived around 9:30 am and did not have much of a wait , although it seemed to fill up quick after we got there .
Nothing really makes it stand out ... just seems to feel like your everyday breakfast spot ... not super inviting .
I never get too enthused with places like this because the breakfasts seem so decadent and i am afraid the meal will be a " punch - you - in - the - mouth " sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing .
The only thing i did not like was that it was a little loud and my jacket smelled greasy for a couple days after my visit .
I go back today and guess what , she made me pay for my meal ... she gave me a free sandwich .. lol .. i told her it was not free because i had already paid for it .... now were talking a kids meal .. nothing outrageous .... but was rude and did not care if i am getting screwed .... i told her i was going to call corporate and she told me go ahead she did not care ... well they not only lost my business at this location ... i will post this so people will go somewhere else .

P.s : notice that employees can not say " your welcome " instead they say " my pleasure " . lol
If it were not for the terrible service , i would have given this place 4 stars .
I came in knowing the exact bag i was going to drop some major cash on , but i guess my appearance did not impress the salespeople enough for them to give me their time .
I am not feeling up handbags for 20 minutes just for sh*ts and giggles .
Their menu has some other options for those that might not be feeling waffles ( omelette , french toast and crepes ) .
Cons : one thing that i can not say i am a fan of is leaving and smelling like grease .
Do not think we 'd be back any time soon unfortunately .
I can not afford the clothes but it does not stop me from appreciating them , they are gorgeous .
The staff was not snooty , they were chatty and sociable , knowing i was not going t buy anything .
I liked the frederic malle perfume but it did not last long me .
Totally not what i was expecting .
I thought i was going to feel very out of place and silly , that was not my experience at all .
The burgers are not very good , kinda dry and lacks taste for 15 $ ...
Just to start this review off , i have never seen a company so devoted to its customers .
I have been going to this location for 5 years and have never once been disappointed !
He did not .
He did not know that wheat contains gluten when i mentioned the soy sauce .
I normally hate being at a small bar with live music , but the singer and the guitar were the perfect level and not too loud that you could not have a conversation .
I have not eaten at a " wow " place in a while where every bite was to be savored .
I just tried the vegan , and i can not get over how good it was .
You will not be disappointed .
Even the breaded entrees are not overshadowed by the hard and crusty layers of breading other ff chains glob on - on efforts to save on the protein .
And yes , as far as fast food goes , they can not do any better .
Very good burgers ( big sizes not mcdonald crap ) very satisfying
I have used her on two separate trips to vegas and she 's nice , easy to work with , and does not hassle you .
He informed me there was no air leakage and therefore no reason to wait -- i was free to go .
Justin looked over my tires and gave me an honest assessment of when i would need new ones ; but at no time did i feel pressured to make a purchase .
Justin volunteered to go out into the parking lot at high noon on a hot day and pre-check my tire , just to ensure i would not need to wait .
I was not sure how on earth it was going to be , but i was quite impressed with the results .
There were a couple of items that i was not able to identify but did not really care because it was delicious .
I did not care for the batter they used .
It was a little doughy and was not nearly crispy enough .
Never made it to dessert , but i bet it would be good too .
The food is all vegan and it definitely does not taste like it .
I am not a vegan so i do not go out of my way to find vegan joints , but i really do enjoy all of their sandwich options immensely , especially the squaker texas ranger .
Sweet but not too sweet with hint of salt .
My only reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is really arbitrary ( and i wish i could give half stars because it 's really not worth a full star point deduction ) .
I never carry cash and generally hate having it .
Ironically , i did not order the tacos , even though that is my staple choice at a new mexican restaurant .
It was not half bad !
My gf was not overjoyed with her chimichanga meal , which was rather sloppy and wet .
It had some crispy parts , but just was not up to her standards .
If you had a stomach ache before , ( which i did ) , i never got one for 2 whole years !!!!
And do not get me started on the chicken deluxe ... they have everything from soup to chicken to sandwiches to salads to you get the point ... and they have also a lot of dressing choices , hot sauce , ketchup , ranch , etc. i also want to tell you about their chick - fil - a sauce .. if you like eccentric / unusual sauces , it 's good . i think many would like it either way ..
Overall i rate 5 stars . now , this is " overated review " but food is good , not to greasy , amazingly customer support , and clean restrooms .
Also , the cashiers say words like " your welcome " and have a positive smile that you can not resist !
To start off , i am not a vegetarian , we came here for friend 's birthday who is .
It was definitely an experience , some of the fish looked quite convincing , but i am not sure i liked the imitation fish , as it could be described as a moist sponge with a fishy taste ... i did very much enjoy the rolls with bean curd on top though .
The food is wonderful but no matter if the place is empty or full , it should not take 45 mins to cook and serve breakfast fare .
Either they send staff home earlier than they should while they can not handle the workload full staff , or they have managed to make waffles into a 45 min item .
I did not know they charged extra for lemonades , which was a down side .
Well i did and i do not see why everyone likes it so much .
Do not get me wrong the pretzels are good , but it 's not life altering in anyway .
Which in my mind is not good for breakfast at all .
Someone ordered a buffalo chicken waffle sandwich and it was brought out , but no one claimed it .
I told the server she could leave it on our table so that it would not go to waste .
Urrrrr she was not having it , oh well i tried .
You honestly would never know this sushi is vegetarian .
I think the fish is soy , but the flavors are all still the same and the texture has not changed at all .
Much lower than my expectation , the cook is not dedicated at all , so the food is not what good veggie food should be like .
Not the best of areas , but you will not be even notice after your taste - buds are whisked away to grandma 's house .
Good chai and it 's not super packed with hipsters like most coffee places .
I decided that i wanted a " specialty " pretzel but i immediately regretted not getting an original .
I have been here many times before but just realized i never created a review ( silly me ) .
I love their pretzels , while they do not compare to philadelphia pretzels , they are pretty damn good .
I know that i am in the minority ... but i really do not like the pretzel shop .
My co-workers often pick up pretzels from here for birthdays or other office events , and everyone spends the morning raving about how delicious the pretzels are and how they can not stop eating them .
I have had them at least 5 - 8 times and can not say that i have ever enjoyed them .
The regular pretzels are either over or under salted ( not sure if that is a preference the customer can select or if it 's just random ) , and the cinnamon sugar just taste strange .
I brought the car to them , and they replaced a brand new tire in less than 30 minutes , no question aksed .
Not an hour and a half to two hours like other places .
While it was not bad at all , it definitely was not one of the better sandwiches i have had in a while .
It kind of just was not anything special in my opinion .
I would like to try their coffee , but i did not have any this time .
I am not sure that i 'd rush back here , but i am definitely glad we finally tried it !
When told of this the store manager , frank mclaughlin , said the service that changed the tire broke it and his store were not responsible .
By not finding out about it until after we left the store led us to believe discount had damaged the assembly and was trying to hide it .
I will never set foot in another discount tire shop and i urge all who read this to do the same .
We even had a guy with us and it was no problem .
Sausage gravy will never be the same .
Never once mentioned " the carnivore " .
In my never ending quest to find the best burger in montreal , this one took me to the west island and did not disappoint .
I do not recalled other all u can eat japanese restaurants has vegan only , but tenon .
We ordered bento boxes and all food do not seem veg. , seems really like raw fish ( me and friend of mine wondered how they can made it !? ) price is average .
Tempura not too oily at all .
Next time might try all u can eat ( even though choices not much from that specific menu ) .
Maybe i just did not order the right items , but it was very pricey .
The positive is that i did not miss the meat too much .
Interesting vegetarian dining experience , but likely would not return .
Server was very friendly , but was not very good .
Ariana took care of our group and could not have asked for better service .
I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food , it was bland and not very tasteful .
Other then that , i will not be coming back to eat here .
The waffles had absolutely no taste to them .
Maybe you should not seat people behind the serving pick up line where they are in danger .
We will not return .
Over a week has passed , i guess he is not going to follow through on his promises , as the gift certificate he said he would send has not arrived .
They do not leave any food on the hot plate or under the lights .
When i ask for the manager , he never comes to the table and he refuses to change the amount .
As a matter of fact , he tells my server he 's not going to change it and i do not have to pay for my food !!
He never shows up and then relays an idiotic statement !!
Order takeout ; do not dine in !
Sounds kind of absurd , but what 's absurd is how delicious they are ... i do not eat them in one sitting , i find them to be just as amazing a few days later as they are right out of the oven stored in an airtight container .
Now i can not go thru south side without stoping .
Not only did i bring my kids there i now enjoy brining my grandson .
Not excessive loudness , but not quiet .
Not a place for a quiet meal .
To start off , i do not believe this place has the right kitchen talent to " bring it " so to speak .
Compared to graceful , which shut down due to their lease expiring , tenon is not anywhere close .
A good sushi place " always " make their own wasabi and ginger , never depending on some wholesale junk .
No worries
I do not come to vegas without contacting her !
She has made the difference in all my trips , do not know what i 'd do without her !
I am never coming to this location again .
She also gave me the wrong order and i did not get a chance to look at it until i got home .
I called to let them know they gave me the wrong order and the manager offered to fix the order if i drove back to the location , but it was not worth my gas money to drive back .
( maybe who knows ) had used my card so i had a balance of $ 0 . the staff were helpful but they could not do anything about it so they called the manager , jack smith .
He looked pissed the entire time and he did not even greet me .
So i asked him if they can help me call the new york office and he said no he will not .
Will never shop at barneys anymore ( i used to shop a lot here hence the gift card ) would give 0 stars if possible .
Great service , always do their best to fix your tire problem fast even tho they are super busy , great customer service and do not over charge , highly recommend
I can not say enough about you guys !!!
This is no joke !!!
Lol ... head bands are not ok at omnia , but hella ok at xs ...
Just to be clear , we did not pay anything to get on these guest lists .
La unica is a place where you can count on no - frills , solid food and portions that will blow your mind .
From central ave , there is not really a " front " .
I was hoping for a jalapeno marg , but it did not come in the mega size , but our server was great enough to provide me with that one !
If you have a spicey need , you might want to keep going because they did not have an extra hot sauce or anything beyond cholula .
We waited 35 mins to be sat , which was to be expected and did not bother us .
Which even then , would not have been so bad if we did not have to watch as other parties who were seated after us get fed within 12 mins of placing their order .
I do not know how every one else feels , but when i think of eating a waffle , i think of being full with yummy syrupy fluffy goodness for a good portion of the day .
My check ended up being over $ 12 for just a waffle ( not including tip ) and i unfortunately , left the place still hungry .
I really expected to love this place , but it just did not happen .
When i arrived i was told that the total price was going to be an additional $ 50 , not including the warranty .
Not only was i floored at the increase in price , but i was also told by joey that i needed to replace another tire asap , since the tread was at a 4 .
I will not be returning due to the dishonesty when i was in a vulnerable state .
She got us into xs on a saturday night with no line and two premium drink tickets !!
Contact michele if you are headed to vegas and want to get in the best clubs with no wait !!
I was expecting to be sold a new tire as i did not think that the damaged one i had could be saved .
Not only did they not try to up - sell me to something i did not really need , the service was completed before the expected time , but the repair was free , i was surprised and impressed at this and will definitely be back for my rotation and balance in 6 k miles .
Pero después de ser ignorada mientras dos parejas q sentaron después de mi , fueran atendidas con bebidas , salsas y chips es imposible q no nos vieran .
No vuelvo a ir y tampoco lo recomiendo .
One thing i will not recommend is the ceviche .
Not terrible , not fantastic .
We sat and were not greeted for about 5 minutes , that 's forgivable .
No exaggeration required .
After the drop she never came back .
About 10 to 15 minutes later , meal finished , still no sign of her .
That never happened ....
He went looking for the waitress and he could not even find her ...
Not sure if we had the same waitress ... we will not be back .
I try to grab a coffee every other day and today i got a new card in the mail , i called to activate it and did not realize it took 24 hours for it to go thru .
Not as cheap as it once was but i love these pretzel sandwiches .
The " house specialty " home fries were dry and had no seasoning .
The nuggets are yummy , flavorful but not overbreaded .
My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy .
And for those of you who have never been to cfa before ?
Who does not love variety ?!
Who would have thought that we would find this type of bbq at this little place in the north hills and by this type of bbq i mean good bbq ... no great bbq !
Do not get me wrong though , all of the meat was fabulous !
I can not !
Even my mom was amazed that what she was eating was not actually real shrimp !
I come here for lunch and dinner and have never ever been disappointed !
I work in a similar job , i do not want someone up my ass or being fake or too intrusive -- but this was the extreme opposite .
The restaurant was not too busy , but we did make reservations just in case .
Also ordered stone pot mixed vegetables with ' chicken ' tasted pretty good , the ' chicken ' which was gluten was ok but still does not really taste like chicken .
All in all the place was not bad .
But it is not working for this guy .
I told her i wanted the large can and she said they did not have it and walked away .
I did not complain .
Mine did not , and when i brought it to my servers attention she said it did not come with that .
She did not concede .
After graciously accepting the check , i told her we would never come back .
I declined their offer and will not return .
I am not sure why this place has bad reviews .
Steak was good and not chewy / fatty ( typical for most places like this ) .
Enchiladas were great , simple red sauce with cheese and not greasy .
Overall , we liked it for a night where cooking was not an option .
I have never tasted another soft pretzel that even comes close .
I have no idea what these low reviewers got when they came here because i received 5 - star all around .
After i left i actually felt bad for not leaving more of a tip - it was that good .
I did not expect much but the food came out lightning fast and it was very good .
The service was amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice-cream ( that the kid did not eat ) back in the freezer while we ate .
It was not too filling in my opinion but some items are definitely worth checking out since i do not know any vegetarian sushi places that have imitated raw fish .
They almost always give me the wrong sauce but the last time i we nt i did not get one of the correct sauces i asked for .
I feel like they are just lazy teenagers who do not give a crap .
I did not realize the difference in the food until i recently went to the one on camelback and the grilled nuggets tasted fresher .
There is no inside seating , and the outside seating is limited to two small tables on a noisy , high traffic street .
We had to ask for dipping sauce as it was not offered to us .
This is a place to maybe pick up some pretzels to take home and heat up ... definitely not a lunch place as some have suggested .
Been roofied by so many bartenders and employees not a good look .
Prob will not be returning
Be aware that the place tends to get loud & we were there when the live entertainment was not playing .
Definitely not a place to go for food - maybe for drinks but this food was tasteless , bland , and not something i want to experience again .
We used the " no wait " app to put our name in around 10:25 am and received a table at about 11:10 am .
The app makes the whole process easier , however if you show up early , or do not use it at all , there is no where to wait inside .
When our order finally arrived , everything was correct , but we were all so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point .
Someone needs to go in and evaluate the whole operation , otherwise they will not be around long .
Also , small minor side note - the " kids menu " is not served in a kid friendly way .
They do not have kids cups or plates .
We noticed that some of the more " expensive " items on the ayce menu never arrived - seaweed salad , salmon rolls , taro tempura .... but the cucumber and avocado rolls kept arriving .
Food never arrived even though we asked for it three times .
The tripe , i asked for extra crispy and it was but i do not think they clean out the tripe , so it is a little grainy , a little gross if you think about it but it is perfectly sanitary since it has been deep fried to a crisp except the inside is again grainy .
The al pastor was so so , it taste just like chorizo seasoning , that is the second place that has happened so i do not know if it might be a regional thing .
They did give free chips if you eat in , they were okay , their drinks are not home made , just come from a dispenser like others .
I would mostly likely never come back since nothing was worth coming back for .
If we do not have any plans , she has great recommendations too !
I made an appointment to get my tire inspect and 45 minutes later i walked out with a patched tire and no charge .
They also have expanded their menu to include more offerings and i can not wait to work my way through them !
This is a smaller restaurant and we went on a weekday , so it was not very crowded .
The waffle was crisp and light , and with the compliment of toppings and mix-ins , was not overly sweet .
Unfortunately i can not afford anything in the store , so i just steal ...
( no need to call the barney five o ) .
I ve been there twice this year and she has never failed to get me and my girlfriends on the guestlists .
A bit pricey , but the food is very interesting and i did not miss the meat .
If i was one of those meat munchers this sandwich sure would not convince me to convert to veganism .
Meat was tough and not particularly flavorful .
Some plates do not have mega portions if that 's what you are looking for , but i always leave feeling filled .
The tofu dish came first and was okay - i did not enjoy it too much because it had the ginger flavor , but the teriyaki sauce was a great compliment .
The only thing i did not like was the salmon - the texture was very jelly - like and tasted mild ; nothing like salmon really .
The prices are not exactly cheap but if you want to try super tasty vegetarian food , this would be a good place to try for the first time !
Portions are not humongous but still very filling .
I was not disappointed .
Can not say the same for the service or host .
Definitely not a place to go for food - maybe for drinks but this food was tasteless , bland , and not something i want to experience again .
Unfortunately the service was not as fast or attentive as what i am used to and did not know much about the menu .
The area that the restaurant is in is in a growing neighborhood of plaza midwood which is great but this place does not hold a. andre to other restaurants in the area .
Do not yinz bring no credit cards !
Was not overly impressed with anything .
The mac and cheese had zero taste and the burger was not anything special .
I came here looking for a pair of tights because i did not want to go to the fashion show mall and barney 's - in my experience - has great quality and helpful service .
Must be nice not to need repeat customers .
I have never come across so many menu options i can decide from - usually there 's only ever a handful of vegetarian options but this place has a huge variety .
Im no vegetarian and no vegan but my buddy is so i go here to eat with him , and this place does nt disappoint !
The place is small and it s sometimes busy mostly not , but the food is good no complains for service its ur typical asian joint
I have never walked into barneys without finding something i want to try on or at least wish i had the $ $ to buy !
I usually never ever shop at this store , in my experience it 's usually filled with lazy , rude , and quite ignorant employees ... but my wife likes the perfume you sale so i was forced to suck it up and go in ....
I was with one other person ( who is not a vegetarian but still loved the food ! ) and we ordered a mango salad , yam tempura roll , assorted veggie tempura , spinach tofu , and pineapple " chicken " fried rice .
Service was not anything special , but that was made up for in the food .
The pineapple " chicken " fried rice had other vegetables in it and the soy chicken was not overwhelming which was nice .
All in all , i can not wait to dine here again .
Food is not prepare in a dilicate way , sushi even loosing .
Service is not good , it 's hard to get attention , we try to get a piece of paper to write down and get refused .
Price are too expensive , we went for a all you can eat dinner , it 's 24 but not even have sashimi , sushi is only rolls .
Many things in their menu are not included .
Not suggest .
I do not know if i am the only one but for me they did not season the rice at all .
There was no taste of the usual rice vinegar taste to the sushi rice that 's usually in normal sushi .
Whoever she talked to said " no problem " and gave her the impression that a reservation was scheduled .
She later emailed la unica to confirm the reservation and received no response .
Therefore , she went to the restaurant in person to confirm the reservation and was told no reservations would be taken for cinco de mayo .
I do not know if the original person she talked to had a language barrier or a policy was not set in a timely manner , but that should not have occurred .
Our group arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and were not seated until 7:45 .
We were also annoyed that our original reservation was not honored .
We asked the waitress approximately 3 times to please take our food order and she kept saying " in a minute " or " please wait . " so , we did not get to put our orders in until about 8:45 p.m. people who were seated after us got their food before us. by 9:45 , we had not received our food and just asked for our food to be boxed and for our checks to be brought .

She did not seem particularly concerned and did not do anything to remedy the situation .
We did not want to just walk out like that , but we felt we had no choice , having lives and jobs to attend to .
So , in sum , we were at la unica nearly four hours and were seated for over two hours with no food .
We were not greeted for 13 minutes .
So hipster they do not even want you here ! - who knows people ?
Just not great on the service .
The burger was dry so i could not finish it !
But even if i celebrate a taco tuesday every now and again , i always make sure to add other things to my order , because hogging a table for $ 4 is not great .
I also tip at least 20 % , and if i am getting tacos , that 's based on the original price , not the $ 1 tuesday price .
Even people i know who are not whimps , like my bff , need to mix it sometimes .
Do not feel bad if you can not do it by itself .
Or do , i can not tell you how to live your life .
I am not a vegetarian myself but i went with a friend who is and to give you an example of how delicious the food was , my friend nearly knocked me out thinking that i tricked her into eating real meat !
But not to worry , everything is soy based with vegetables even if looks fool you .
Never fun when your tire blows out driving to a job site on one of the hottest days of the year , but found a spot of shade and got it changed pretty quickly .
Do not forget to match your meal with a root beer float or a chocolate fudge milkshake for the full experience .
It is not the place for a " quiet " romantic dinner unless you wish to seduce with a delicious burger .
To do so , we would have to come by the restaurant to pick it up which does not make any sense since we ordered for delivery for a reason .
In response , the staff member then tried to blame the error of not fulfilling the order on the delivery service .
So , instead of trying to fix the problem , the staff member thought it would be better to not fulfill what we ordered and tried the blame game on somebody else .
Denying accountability when it is clear that the error lies with you , is not what i would call even decent customer service .
No appointment .
Our service was covered under warranty no charge ; so i guess it was worth that wait !
It is hard to find a decent almond milk latte , and though it was not the best it was well worth the trip .
The flavoring was not too over powering .
And i am guilty of being one of those people who love a sweet drink , though , i am trying to cut more sugar out of my life so maybe it was a good thing to not have it so sweet , and so with that i tasted the almond milk flavoring more than i would like .
A little bit too loud to have a meeting there , but i am sure they would turn it down if there was not too many people there .
This discount tire has always treated me great and they do everything the can to make your experience as great as it can be because let 's face it ... no one wants to buy new tires !
Unfortunately , we will not be coming back here .
The man at the counter told us there are no high chairs , which makes it close to impossible for us to enjoy a meal with our small children .
I am surprised such a casual restaurant would not be accommodating to families .
My only two complaints are that they do not clearly label which things are vegan or which can be made vegan ( i think we have only been served vegan items there , but i am never 100 % sure , since nothing on the menu is labeled ) , and that they are located so far from downtown toronto .
Host never returned even though more people came in after us .
My burger was barely edible - the meat was decent but the bun smelled and tasted too gluten -y , i ended up not eating the bun .
Because our waiter never returned to ask how everything was , i ended up asking the first person i saw for a new one ( ended up being the manager or something ) and got the replacement in about 5 minutes .
I did not even finish it .
As far as the restaurant itself , my sister had a broken seat ( akin to a rocking chair , the seat of her side of the mini- booth was not bolted down ) .
The only person that does not love pretzels is a person that has not been here .
Great food but i gave it a 3 cuz that poor girl works her butt off and it 's not fair .
We checked out the the mens floor and were greeted and 1 gentlemen was helping me find a pair of jeans but no luck but great service !
I got no explanation , other than , " yea , you will need to replace them soon . " next , as i hand the guy my keys , he says it will be two hours to rotate my tires .
Do not assume your customers have 2 hours to spare for tire rotation , it is not logical .
If it will take more than an hour , just tell us up front and we will stop by when you are not so busy .
I do not give a sh*t about your internal dirty laundry !
Or was it just because joe was not working today ?
Anyway , the cherry on top of this shitty experience , was as i drove off the lot i had to pull over because they did not close the hood .
No more discounts ?
I have never been disappointed and aside from her referring me to the correct people i love that everyone is on top of it all and responds quick .
I do not usually yelp it but i knew i had to get the info out there .
I put in an order for pickup at 7:50 p and was told it would be 10 minutes and i did not receive my order until 8:30 p.
I stood and waiting by the hostess stand for 25 minutes waiting on my order and before i could even speak to a manager , the hostess ran away and did not even offer an apology .
Overall the place is a good value and i have not been disappointed yet .
Eh it was ok , not as amazing as everyone tells me it is .
The sauce was not inspiring but ok .
But , i only eat fast food if it is outstanding and this was not it .
I have been quite a number of times , but i still have not gone through all the items on the menu .
I do not mean it taste like artificial cheese or that it had a bad flavor .
It has absolutely no flavor .
She is not happy ... lol
You did not really need syrup and they were super filling .
Did not realize that this is an all vegan place besides a few dairy addition options .
I was devastated i could not leave with it in my arms .
In any case , i did not leave barney 's empty - handed .
The second time they seemed to be out of everything and the service was not impressive .
It was not the kind of burn that makes bbq taste better , it was the kind of burnt taste that overpowers the dish .
It seems there are very few mexican restaurants close to uptown that are not like gourmet taco shops or upscale mexican food or something else different .
When i arrived , there was plenty of parking and the dining area was not very full .
I was no longer mad her cheerfulness and authentic approach was infectious !
You can not beat it .
I have been going there for often for a while now and whenever i order even just a drink it takes no shorter than like 8 minutes .
So definitely not a starbucks lol .
A bit messy and they did not include a napkin in the to - go bag so make sure you grab one .
Just makes me want to say no no no no no la unica was a big disappointment unfortunately .
I would not recommend this place to eat on taco tuesday or just in general if the quality of the food that i received that night is any indication of what this restaurant has to offer .
This place honestly feels like they are a barely making it by and trying to pass off quality food with cheap prices but it does not work .
I am not rush to come back but if daring to go give it a try at least get the chips and salsa with drinks .
( he 's not there every week , but you will find him there on some wednesday afternoons for the whole " kids eat free " thing . )
I was so mesmerized , as i waited in line to order and then for my food , that i hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones did not detract from my experience !
I came on a saturday night and had no wait to be seated , or for food which was nice .
It tasted petty good , a little sour , but not bad .
Note : do not try to enter at the the front of the building !!
I recommend the nitro with no sweet , no cream for you plain coffee drinkers .
Overall great place , can not wait to come back and try one of those gourmet grilled cheeses .
That being said , i would highly recommend you not spend your money at this chick - fil - a.
I ran through the drive thru one day with my kids and ordered lunch ( i had not been to this location in years ) .
Ok , no problem .
One of the things i look forward to is stopping by barney 's ( i do not gamble ) .
Let 's just say i am never ever ever going back to this store .
The two of us decided to go and when we got there the place is empty ... i mean we were the only customers on the men 's floor ... no one else ( at the time of arrival ) ... yet there were about 3 workers standing around ... and guess what ?
They decided they did not want to help us ... at all !!
Well , let 's just say she was not helpful and rude .
After he pays , i am looking at some pomade as well and there was samples for some and not for all .
Well , since i was just being watched like a hawk , but not being helped , i decided crack it open to see the consistency .
Well , little did i know that hidden in the back of the bottom shelf was the sample for this product ... not in the right place ... but if she was doing her job then this would not have happened .
She looks , can not find one , then opens the box and cracks open a fresh one ...omg !!!
I said , " does not feel good going the other way huh ? "
I grabbed the original product i was looking at to purchase and a bag that i was interested in buying and decide to go to the level below because i did not want to work with this lady .
I had no desire to work with someone that 's lazy and rude .
Well , as my buddy and i proceed to walk down the stairs she literally stops me and says , " you can not take that stuff down there " ... i said , " what ???
I am black and buddy is mexican ... i am the last guy to play this card , but i have no other explanation on why this would have happened .
Unfortunately , it was huge and i had no chance of finishing it successfully .
Even though we live 2 miles away , we probably will not return .
You can not go wrong with the pretzel shop /
While reading andrew s's review i got to the part about his gf 's chimichanga , and i did a double take because i had not realized i 'd been with him for the experience in question .
I probably would not miss it if i were not to retuurn , but it 's decent enough if i needed some mexican food nearby .
The pretzel sandwiches are less than $ 3 and a great lunch - not too much food .
My dish arrived shortly and the food was ok , nothing memorable as i can not even remember what i ordered .
So , i said all that to say this ... you got ta be kiddin ... i wo n't be back !
Well , i am not afraid of broadening my horizons .
What really caught my attention is the fact that this place was clean , not a dirty table in the joint .
I gave her my american child 's request for this and that added and removed and she accommodated with no fuss .
I wanted a chimichanga but i was feeling chorizo so how about combining the 2 . no problemo here !
Thick , not runny & it had a pleasant little kick to it .
I m regretting not posting a pic of my chimmi masterpiece .
Lol keep an eye out amigo 's because after a couple more visits to ensure i was not dreaming , i will be moving my rating up a notch .
Terrible ...... do not go !!!!
Not only was she quick to reply to our messages , she was also super friendly and ready to help us out .
Can not wait to work with her next time we are in town :)
The brisket was a little fatty and not as tender and juicy .
Although we did not stop here this time around , we commonly stop in for my girlfriend .
That is not a typo .
Feeling like i was in wonka 's shop , and not wanting to waste this rare opportunity ( i do not hit the south side often ) i also grabbed a plain pretzel .
The taste also seemed a bit off - needless to say , i did not drink much of it .
Over the years , i have taken a strong liking to chick - fil - a. the chicken is tasty and is not processed like the other fast food restaurants .
They are a bit small so they are not filling but they were excellent .
It 's just too weird for me to try again hahaha bento combo - chicken teriyaki ( 2 / 5 ) i did not like this .
The fake chicken meat tasted very mushy and the sauce was not good .
Try not to go to this place during the vegetarian chinese holidays ( using around the time there 's a full moon ) as those are the days this restaurant is busy due to people who are vegetarian on these specific days .
The food here is not bad , especially if you are a vegetarian .
Could not even finish my portion considering how hungry i was with all the wait time .
Seriously do not put yourself through it .
After over an hour they had still not started .
Why tell me 45 mins when you would not have even started over an hour later if i had not said something ?
There is not a lot denim to choose from .
We ordered a few amount of dishes , since not our whole party wanted ayce .
Here visiting a friend and they recommended this place and boy howdy , i am not disappointed .
We both discreetly licked our plates when had no more food to eat .
Staff was pleasant , no real atmosphere to speak of but who care s when the food is this good .
Glad my diet does not start until next week !
Warning - it fills up quick and on the weekends they do not take reservations so get there early or prepare to wait .
This is one of the few fashion establishments that i like to poke around in but never really buy , along with burberry .
They do not really deserve four stars because it is so unbelievably pricey and they refuse to cater in any way to anyone that might be suffering in a down economy .
Regardless , i like to look at the cosmetics and leather goods , and i recently came here to decide if i wanted to spend a ton on a new wallet for my husband - a berluti scritto wallet that i have never seen sold anywhere but barney 's .
Last time , i came in looking for a pair of long black boots ... i found a beautiful pair by roberto del carlo ... but it was not my size ... the sales person immediately checked their back stock and even tried to locate it from a different barney 's ... no luck , but i did walk out with the same boot in a chocolate brown ... and even got 50 % off ... that 's a $ 300 discount !!
What a deal ... did have to throw out the box though ... it would not fit into my suitcase ... i hate that ... luckily it came with a dust bag =)
It did not even taste or look like pork to be honest .
I do not think i will be coming back anymore .
The only reason why i did not give this place a 5 star review is that the service is just ok .
I will put this on my list of never coming back to .
I have had poached eggs at over 60 + breakfast places and never have i seen this .
Here is a tip : just wait on people and do not comment on their every move .
Could not have asked for better .
This was the second time i used her to get on guest lists for the clubs in vegas and i could not be happier .
Do not use these guys !
She is absolutely wonderful and i am so glad i stuck to my guns and did not pay some outrageous fee that the other companies charge .
Not taste to meat .
Y'know , i have never actually been in this place as it always seems to be closed whenever i venture to the sahs syde , but every now and then , someone i know ends up getting pretzels from there for everyone , and they are always tasty either hot or cold .
Once as a child , i was whining and carrying on about something i did not wan na do or whatever while we were visiting my grandmother when she lived on sarah street .
There was not a peep outta me the rest of the day .
These ai not the kind of pretzels you will find at a department store 's snack bar or a ball park concession stand .
You do not get that pepper on the bottom , that oven baked flavor that bleeds character , care , and the old - school , that chewy toughness that evokes what south side used to be ; street as hell .
If you do not like a lot of salt , make sure to tell them " light salt " .
We had brisket , ribs and salmon , and they were all tender , smoky , not dried out .
Food is not very good .
I will not be going back .
1900 mexican grill is not bad , but aztecas is by far the best !
Although the service was incredibly terrible , the food was amazing , so did not want my review to reflect the poor service .
Hopefully the manager or owner will have some training so patrons are greeted , and not treated like they are an inconvenience .
It should be noted i am not vegan or vegetarian , but visited with my bff ( who is ) , and we both loved the sandwiches we shared .
It was not packed yet , but by 10:00 there was a line out the door .
Manager was not interested when we spoke to him .
Guess our $ 100 meal / business is not needed ..
Teen girls goofing around in the window , not doing their job .
We were also charged for extra items that were not asked for ; however , we expected more from chick - fil - a and trusted them enough to drive away without checking .
Hire more mature workers who do not stick their nose into other people 's business that are outside of the window .
I do not think it 's necessary to have 5 + teen girls in the window .
The clubs in the wynn and encore are all the best on the strip and she gets you in so fast that your feet do not have time to hurt while waiting in those long lines .
I can not begin with the praise i 'd give this restaurant .
He offered a free appetizer coupon for a different day if we had decided not to stay .
Add a side of scrambled eggs ( for protein , of course ! ) cooked perfectly , and a coffee cup our waitress never let get more than half empty .
Not too impress with jukebox .
Does not make sense ?!?!
When she spilt the drink the waitress and did not say a word !
You will never find a better pretzel anywhere .
This is a quick stop on your way somewhere , not someplace to come and sit for lunch .
Hidden off mcknight road , we had not heard of wheelfish until recently , despite searching for great bbq in pittsburgh .
It is a solid choice , but did not get " wowed " by the experience .
Tuesdays - can not go wrong .
There are about 8 different tacos to pick from , but i always go for the chicken and veggie tacos - they never disappoint .
I do not get to much of a chance to shop here , since i live in las vegas , like most locals , i try to avoid the strip like the plague .
Tasty and not greasy at all .
She always hooks it up , never a time that i was disappointed .
You will not ever have to worry about that from michelle .
Can not believe their salmon are vegan !
They were very busy but i did not feel i had inconvenienced them in the slightest .
The two bartenders and manager were not interested in helping her .
We did not realize that we were supposed to have some bbq sauce with it until after we finished and the tables around us had the bottles .
Two got the salmon which again was not very warm and was served dry without any sauce at all .
After a few rounds we asked for the bill and were told that we could not split a party of six , after we were told that would not be a problem before the meal .
Why they could not ring us up as three parties of two , i do not know .
Why they have large tables if they can not split them , i do not know .
I had no problem with that - lesson learned - i bought a new , better set that consisted of 24 black locking lug nuts - not cheap .
I asked him if he would not mind having the tech do them by hand so i do not have rust streaks all over my black lug nuts and wheels .
Do not hurt my lug nuts ! " .
In a nutshell , i am never going back to his location .
No wheel purchases .
No tire purchases .
And when i did get my food it looked like my tacos did not have the meats in it i basically had to combine 3 tacos to make one !
Not sure what happened but i will never go back there again nor will my family and friends !
Whenever i need tire service i come to this location because they truly care about service and even when something may not go great the manager joe or assistant manager yaz step up and go the extra mile to make things right .
Not to mention , they are a lot better tasting !
The shrimp are seasoned and grilled ( not fried ) , juicy and it cones with a big slice of avocado and fresh pico on the taco ..
I just can not say enough about this place ...
As though they are looking to put barbecue on things like nachos etc and those dishes do not really jump out as being spectacular , but the barbecue itself is .
I am not a vegetarian and this was my first time going to a completely vegan restaurant .
Guess i am just not used to imitation meat / seafood .
Never again !
I do not do fast food very much anymore , but i stopped here over the weekend to show chick - fil - a some love for standing by their morals .
This is a treat , not a regular thing for me , but i am glad to support them .
Definitely get the corn muffin - it 's not your mothers it 's better !
There are a couple things they need to improve : * they do not clean tables after a customer leaves .
* they do not do a good job of cleaning the stuff on the side table , like the water container .
I appreciate the fresh grinding , but unless no one else in line , getting a drink becomes a time commitment .
*** only grief about xs club itself was the promotions entrance was on the backside so we ended up doing a full circle around the hotel casino and the comp drinks were not for flavored alcohol ( no upgrade option ) .
No hurry to ever return eve though it is very close to home .
Maybe it is strictly geared to be a drinking bar , not a restaurant / bar.
Normally i would not grant this type of favor on a stranger , but she was quite the stunner , so i relented on my rigid rule on this particular instance .
Eventually she goes with a varvatos ensemble that 's not too shabby .
I go , had a blast , made a friend . ps - no luck finding a jacket haha .
The brisket is not shredded but sliced and the chicken is smoked and then deep fried and it is moist and juicy .
The lunch menu was very cheap and i would suggest going for lunch for a great deal and the portions were not smaller they were quite large !
The only reason i did not give 5 stars is because the service is not as friendly as the indian trail location .
However , last week my visit was not up to it s usual standard , so when i received the survey in my email i answered it honestly .
I got an email from the store manager , frank , apologizing for the trouble and telling me what he was already doing to " make it right " ( which , in this case , was ordering a new set of wheel locks direct from the auto manufacturer so that i would not have to ) .
Customer service is half about getting it right the first time , and half about fixing the things that happen when it is n't right the first time .
I am not a huge coffee person but their cold brew nitro is amazing !!
Can not wait to go back and try more of what they have to offer !
Used the no wait app , which cut back on us standing around outside since the waiting area is very tiny .
The texture is similar but not spot on , the mock version is made from tapioca so it has a jelly - like feel to it .
I will only return for the salmon sashimi mock ( i can not have real sashimi during my pregnancy ) .
Otherwise , i did not enjoy with the rest of the food .
The chicken terryaki was fairly " chicken like " but i still did not enjoy the dish .
Helped me and my girls get into xs nightclub , no problem .
I already had a feeling it was not going to be that great , but what the heck , i always pick where we go so i let him have it ;) the dining area is nice !
Not even a kick !
Not this crap !
The burgers and fries are great and i am able to get a burger served in a lettuce leaf if i do not feel like a bun .
I always want to try more of their menu , but how can i not get the carne asada burrito ?!
This locale is always messy .... the condiments are always disorganized .... and the lemonade on my last 3 occasions has not been good ..... for lack of a better word .
Eat , drink , and be merry my friends ..... just not at this chick - fil - a.
You would never know where wheelfish is .
Second and third time not so much .
I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt being that i have worked in the industry , but the queso app ( it 's queso , it does not take that long ) came out after our entrees and when she brought the check she told us that she had not added the app to the check yet ( i am assuming she remembered it , told the kitchen to make it , but never put it on the check ) , took our check back , and added it .
He not only quickly got the ball rolling , but gave me a discount equal to the rebate i could have gotten .
I have always been a meat or seafood person , i thought it be just no taste etc .
To my surprise it was very tasty and not taste greasy at all .
U be surprise , shrimp taste but it 's not shrimp , then the fish taste like fish but it 's not .
They never disappoint with any of their baked goods , and prices are reasonable !
Was not going to get anything to eat but the smell of the smoker upon entering the place changed my mind .
I do not usually write reviews but i had to because of how well i was treated today .
I will be a customer for life , will not buy another tire from anyone else again .
Got there an hour before closing and they had no regular pretzels .
How can you be a pretzel shop and not have pretzels .
Drove 30 minutes to get there and no pretzels , not cool .
The service honestly was not very friendly the day i went , but it was not horrible either .
Overall it is not a place i would drive out of my way to come to again .
Although it is veggetarian food so it s a lot of carbs but they do not downgrade the quality if you do the all you can eat vs a la carte .
I tried this place a couple years ago but have not been back just because it 's far from my house .
We also ordered their flan i have never had a flan that good at any restaurant .
I will start this by stating that i do not fit the typical barney 's demographic .
Not visually , anyway .
If they do not approach me immediately because of my " just passing through the store to my car " look .
I am talking very casual and not in a hip kind of way .
Dallas is not participating in the bag event due to the closure date .
He told me that they did not carry it , but madison ave ( nyc ) did and he would take care of everything to make sure i got what i wanted , and during the big event .
Well , of course he does , but it 's not as much as all that and he spent a lot of time getting this , following up , calling me back a few times , etc ... great customer service , raul !
I think they try to balance the desire of many people to not be pestered with the polar opposite ...
People who get offended of they are not approached !
Do not get butt hurt if someone does not fall all over you .
The place is not only easy to find being right on east carson street in the southside of pittsburgh , but it has the absolute cheapest and freshest pretzels ever .
The downside , you can not sit down to eat inside and there is always a line .
Do not miss a chance to get something , even just to take home , from here .
However , the back of a strip mall abuts the lot , which is not the most ideal situation and could be a potential eye sore .
They did not disappoint !
Had no clue but when i walked in from the parking lot to the altman bros i knew this place is a gem .
I could not have been more blessed !
Xs is the best pool party in town and michelle got us great access with no trouble or wait !
No one in our group tonight is vegan or vegetarian .
However , contrary to many others ' experiences here , i did not think the " salmon " tasted , looked or felt like the real thing .
The food definitely was creative and made a concerted effort to mimic real fish , but was not entirely successful .
Overall , i think this place does a good job at serving a specific type of clientele , but it was not for us .
Michelle is not the typical promoter !
If you are used to promotors who just talk and do not deliver , well guess what , you are in luck cause michelle is the opposite !
You will not regret working her !
However , when we got there it did not look like anything special , so we just got 4 regular pretzels ( 60 cents each !! ) and we nt home .
She is amazing and will definitely take care of you no matter where u want to go .
You will not be disappointed !
They have all of the brands i love and some others i had not previously heard of before .
I did not realize tory burch had an activewear line .
I am not sure i would consider a white cashmere sweater " activewear " but it was cute as all heck .
I started wandering around with it on the hanger knowing 100 % i wanted it and was not even going to spend the time trying it on .
No they did not .
Certainly not for them being busy .
Not helping customers because you are lazy is super unprofessional and the , " i am so cool that i work here " attitude is obnoxious .
She asked me if i wanted to try on the sweater and said she appreciated that i told her why i preferred not to ( possible smoke smell ) .
Sadly , that was short lived because i was told " not to take pictures " while waiting for my cousin to scope out a handbag .
First , i had not taken a photo in the first place .
I still giggle at the weirdness of that exchange and overly snobby attitude of some sales kid too busy standing talking to his coworker and not helping my cousin .
Perhaps help your customer and not yelling at them for taking a picture , which i had not .
Stay in your lane and leave the nasty attitude at home because those of us shopping do not care that you work there , we just want to buy things .
I know this may sound like a lot of scuttle over something seemingly silly , and it would be silly if it were one salesman with a sour attitude and not multiple floors of people standing around not helping anyone until i am getting accosted by perfume sprays on my way out .
Will not be going back !!
Never going to go back !
We were not the only ones who waited a long time for the mediocre food .
I tried to mix my rice / beans together but that did not help anything .
Probably do not like as much spice and flavor as we do but the burnt meat in the el pastor tacos - unacceptable .
Totally not mexican and very gross !
They are not your traditional home fries by any means and they are terrible .
Not sure if they are stressed or what , but i sometimes feel sheepish to order something .
Never reliable .
Now the burgers are dry and even the buns are not fresh .
Not very appealing .
The cheese nacho and the mac and cheese contain no real cheese ...
I do not know what happened ...
I can not put into words why i like them .
Their menu is not extensive but what they offer is excellent .
A bag of these taken to give out at work will make you a hero and not cost you an arm and a leg .
You have not lived till you have had the hot dog wrapped in pretzel dough .
But here 's a tip , the best thing in here is not the pretzel .
Get two - and not to share !
I always want to order much more but can not !
This place never dissapoints and the chef knows whats up
The burger was quite dry and did not taste anything special at all , what a disapointment .. mac and cheese tasted like fake cheese with orange coloring .
Poutine was lacking and was not special .
The milk shake was not bad .
I would not recommend this place at all .
I did not expect for the employees to be this helpful .
Service was a little slow and it took long to get our food which normally does not bother me as long as i know that my food is on it 's way .
My burger was not bad but it came a little cold which really ruined everything for me .
Their mac and cheese was not bad but not worth going back there only for the mac n cheese .
Sadly i do not think i will go again
I did not know that this was not the same as last time i was there .
I will not return because i felt very unwelcome when a young lady started sweeping the floor right in the area i was seated .
Just the male waiters are not very good from trying to seat a group of 6 at smaller tables when clearly bigger tables available .
The menu offers a lot of different options that you can not usually find .
I am not sure what happened but this place was not nearly as great as our 1st few times here .
Younger girl at register ... not very nice , did not know specifics about ingredients or menu items .
Her mom ended up taking our order , just as unfriendly ... not mean , just not customer service friendly .
They did not have flan but they had it on the menu very disappointing visit .
I would shake my fist at the sky and wonder who would not ever let me have delicious warm pretzely snacks .
They were not warm but it was nothing a quick trip to a warm oven or the microwave would not cure .
They do not serve greasy bar food -- they sell generous portions of smoked meats , real mac n cheese and corn bread muffins .
She got us into all the clubs with no hastle and no wait .
The old cougar that decided to help us was such a b that she did not even want to help us .
I am happy the chips were not too salty , but everything felt very " out of the can " .
Did not feel like restaurant food .
I wanted the smores milkshake , but when they told me the marshmallows were raw , and not toasted , i dismissed it .
The bowl shape was very cool though , it was tilted up , i think that was my fav part lol the havarti cheese was thinly sliced and not flavorful .
My date looked nausious from all the grease from his burger , and he did not touch his fries .
I really liked the way the restaurant was decorated , but the air conditioning was way too much , we were freezing cold x , x gave me a serious case of nippleitis which forced me to slouch my back to hide them behind the high counter cause i did not want to embarass myself on my 1st date with that guy ... thank god my shirt was black !
Remember the customer in front of you is the most important one no matter who awaits behind .
The pretzels are delicious but i gave it 3 stars because who waited on me was not respecting my business .
But one thing i do not understand is why they do not post their closing hours anywhere .
I literally searched it does not sites and none of them had a time for that location .
I can not wait to go back and try other platters and their lunch specials !
One of the highlights of the dinner was when we tasted the spices salmon roll , we all thought it was real fish .. even my husband can not taste the difference .
My husband was not a big fan of vegetarians dishes , but he said he want to come back again .
The chai was perfectly sweetened ... not too sweet thankfully .
I did not get a chance to try the food , but would love to come back one day for it !
Second time i order from this place , my coworker was going to go and i forgot my lunch at home so i had no choice .
I called and they said to bring it back and ill get a refund .. well it is now completely out of my way and the whole reason my coworker went was because i obviously could not !
Never again will i order from there !
They have even repaired tires i did not get at their location ( manufacturer tires ) for free !
You will not find everything you 'd see at a flagship store , but hey , you are in vegas , and you really want , there 's a boutique shop for every brand possible on the strip .
You can not go wrong with a hot fudge milkshake !
The pulled pork is perfect , slaw adds a great tangy crunch ( not mayonaise - y , which i love ) , and the sides were all incredible as well .
Last but not least , the live music was a huge bonus !!
Nice - looking not nice to eat !!
Do not order mac & cheese worst i have ever had .
Not an expansive menu , but that was a plus because everything ordered at our table was excellent .
The fish was " meh " and was not spicy , but more sweet than anything else .
I was not a fan of it .
You will never have inconsistent quality .
I grew up near the original , i will never live more than a mile from a branch of this staple .
Their chips and salsa are great , which are free if you choose to eat there , just not for takeout , which kinda sucks , but it is good too .
They got some big bootied young girl who was rude as hell , but i go for the food so i will not stop going in there to eat .
Because of the location , i do not think many people stop there because it is not easily visible from the street .
Mucho taco is always spotless and never smells funny .
You do not have cooks back there who are dirty and sweaty and busy contaminating everything like what you see at filiberto's .
The food never settles weird in my stomach , and i have a very sensitive stomach .
No greeting and no offer to help .
Then one guy said hello , but still did not ask me if i needed help .
I was picking up a couple of shoes to try on , but no one was there .
Just looked at me and no greet , no assistance .
Not even a smile .
Did not even ask if i needed help .
I was about to go down to the handbags section , but i did not want to waste anymore time in that store because of the awful non-existent customer service .
I know i was not dressed luxuriously , but you should not judge a book by it s cover .
I left the store with nothing and i do not think i will be going in there again .
I did not really know what to expect since i had only shopped online up until this point and did not get a chance to go to the one in new york on fifth while i was there so i walked in ... and was dazzled !
Yes it made me feel like i probably should not touch anything , move anything or even breath too much in there , but it was still gorgeous .
I heard the store has great sales , unfortunately was not there during sale season , but they did have an amazing selection of classic louboutins , dare i say that even rival the louboutin boutiques in vegas !
The place was pretty low key when i went in on a saturday afternoon , not very busy .
Not too sweet and not hard like some scones .
I had never been to this cfa and it was absolutely packed full !
My ' taco tuesday ' hidden gem is not so hidden anymore .
Chorizo is also decent , but not as good as the others .
The building was packed but i was still in and out in less than 90 minutes with no appointment .
We almost gave up and turned back and we nt downtown but i am glad we did not !
I ordered the buffalo chicken poutine and a banana split milkshake ( which was delicious ) , one of my friends ordered a burger ( not quite sure which burger but he said it was delicious ! ) with a side of poutine and a cheesecake milkshake and my other friend ordered a chilli cheese dog and a side of poutine with a chocolate milkshake ( i think ) .
So filling , i could not finish my food so i brought the rest home .
I will definitely go back , no doit about it .
My wife had the funky monkey and could not stop raving about it .
Also got a chocolate muffin that i can not wait to try !
I gave this place the key for the wheel locks and waited almost two hours when i had an appointment in the first place and they came out and said that they had to drill out the locks because they did not have my key ?
I told them that i gave it to them when i paid and gave them my car keys and they said " oops , it 's in the folder " and no sorry or anything .
I paid extra to have those wheel locks put on and i did not even get an i am sorry !!!!
Like their ads say , they did not spend all morning baking hundreds of pretzels just so they could not sell them to you .
Sure , it 'd be kinda cool in that ' exclusive ' way , but you 'd get tired pretty fast of not getting that salty , salty pretzel you want so badly .
Do not ask them why , but they steeply discount their food for redheads .
Oh yeah , it 's possible they have outdoor seating , but i have never been able to tell because i have been busy eating pretzels - which this place has a lot of !
Even if your not vegan you 'd fall in love with this place .
Also , they sell " kobe beef " that is obviously not certified and is an imitation .
Shame on this awful place never going back .
The staff was great but the food .... well not so much .
Since collaborating with the nile theater , people might be confused with the location of the coffee shop / restaurant but it 's not too bad .
But i am afraid the craving for more can not be sated by any fewer than 20 of these perfect tacos .
Oh , and i did not get chips or a pickle as i am seeing on the other pics .
This place gets extra points for having food i can order for my kids which is not hamburgers and fries .
The menu is not overwhelming , focusing on bbq and a few accompaniments .
Definitely not a bad friday out !
So i order a chicken sandwich with no pickles .
They did not make me a new one , just took the pickles off .
I come here quite often , but after this experience i may not be coming back .
This place does not have the best customer service , but it is usually okay .
There were about 4 customers in the building today so it was not really busy and 2 women working .
The women working did not even look at me or say , " we will be right with you " so i waited some more still no acknowledgement .
Do not think i will be back .
Food and drinks are decent but not worth that treatment .
Will not return but nice place .
Milkshakes were great burgers were ok but nothing more and i would not come back for them .
The fries were not very crispy .
So they have moved up from avoiding them to acceptable but not going out of my way .
I am not a heat seeker so i am sure some would find the hot salsa to be fairly mild .
Never too salty or too bland which seems to be how some mexican restaurants are .
I would give a lower rating for always waiting too long but it 's not the teams fault on the front lines doing the hard work !
It 's not fair that the workers are being pushed this hard , as well !!
It 's only benefiting the store , not their customers !!
If a customer has an appt , then they should service their car at that specific time , not almost an hour later !
Who does not love a soft pretzel ?
I came here with some friends last weekend for their vegan brunch , and i can not say enough good things about it !
Can not seem to find a spot with good tamales around here .
Come here for the tacos ... do not bother with anything else .
* note : i did not receive this as i ordered take out , but there was a sign that said " free chips and salsa for dine in customers " .
I do not understand why this place is never packed , if this was situated downtown , it 'd definitely do very well .
It 's everything salmon was to me except it does not have a fishy smell and it 's cruelty free - 100 % approve !
Honestly it 's kind of expensive , considering real fish is not used but it 's a great vegan friendly treat and it 's nice to know we have one here in markham aka meat - lovers land !
I do not really know what to do with my life now that i have been here .
It just can not be beat .
How is this gem in markham and not in toronto ??
Premium products , not - so - premium service .
The lv store did not have her size , but the sf store did .
However , we were told that barneys can not overnight fedex merchandise for saturday deliveries .
Over at saks we told the saleswoman what happened at barney's and she said that saks no doubt would be able to saturday fedex .
At the time we were first in the store , it was 2 pm , well before the 4 pm cutoff and he had not given us the option .
At this point , it was 6 pm , so saturday delivery definitely could not happen .
The guy said " i am sorry , but you are not going to be able to have your shoes for saturday night . "
No , they could not fedex them to us because it was past 4 pm and their pickup was already gone .
But no , apparently they can not think outside the box like that .
Very disappointing that a store commanding such premium prices ( we are talking about an $ 800 pair of shoes ) in this economy can not get a little creative for a customer .
Sad that we could make it happen , but barneys new york could not make it happen .
Their coffee tasted horrible as there 's no coffee taste at all .
Not a ton of healthy but a whole lotta flavor and bar type food you may miss from your meat eating days .
Not coated in sauce just little diced faux grilled chicken lightly dipped in wing sauce .
There was a little vegan ranch drizzled but a cup on side so did not weigh down the salad .
Can not say the same for the service or host .
I used to love going here , but they took away the all you can eat option , i will not be returning .
Not as good as fresh , but you can not get a decent pretzel for love or money on the left coast . ) one tip : if it 's before 2 pm , do not go in the front door .
Not as good as fresh , but you can not get a decent pretzel for love or money on the left coast . ) one tip : if it 's before 2 pm , do not go in the front door .
No sandwiches or cookies or drinks back there , just pretzels , but omg pretzel pretzel pretzel .
I have never been disappointed with the service at barney 's .
I have been to a few other locations around the country ...... i have never been disappointed .
I was looking for some shoes , but did not find the exact ones i was looking for and my wife was looking for some cosmetics .
She found the moisturizer she was looking for and it was not overly expensive .
It was not cheap but the price was much better than i expected .
No errors with my order .
When you have not even finished your first meal and you are already planning your next visit !
It 's not fine dining but somewhere between taco bell and azteca .
Carne asada was not too spicy , a bit dry , but service was prompt , friendly and the place was clean .
Not sure if the sauce is homemade or not but it is certainly delicious .
It did smell a bit like cigarettes and the smell was not coming from outside .
I have had the burritos , tortas , chimichangas and tacos and i can not decide which one is the best .
They are quick and friendly - perfect for lunch or for those nights you do not want to cook .
Not saying bad just that i expected them to knock my shoes off because everything else about this place did .
I am not from the area but where i am from our chick fil a has good customer service , and is not stingy on their sauce .
Seem to not care .
They were not packed like the first time we came here .
Asking for sauce and not give us a lot .
I did not think that vegan sushi would stand a chance against the areal ' stuff but it turns out that fish are friends and not food !
I am not usually a huge fan of eel because of all the teeny tiny bones that you have to watch out for .
That 's obviously not a problem here !
Lots of great filling and you never noticed that the chicken was not chicken .
I was just so surprised that everything tasted so good even though it was meatless ... maybe those vegans are not so crazy after all ?!
He sighed deeply , and turned to me and said , " i left my wallet in my backpack at home . " my stomach dropped , and i was pretty crushed , because seriously .... all i wanted was a stupid chicken sandwich ... so we pull through , and i let a young blonde woman know that we forgot our wallets at home and could not pay for the food .
She smiled and without missing a beat said , " do not worry this one is on us . " no guilt , no second guessing , just no problem and a smile .
She smiled and without missing a beat said , " do not worry this one is on us . " no guilt , no second guessing , just no problem and a smile .
Not only did we get our ( delicious ) food , we also got a few extra of our favorite sauces as a little icing on the cake .
You did not know how stressful our week had been .
You did not know that all i wanted was that chicken sandwich .... you were just being kind to a stranger in your drive thru .
Young - blonde - woman - who 's - name - i- do not - know , thank you for your kindness .
Did not rush me at all when i was deciding on what perfume i wanted to purchase .. she also helped me pick out some chanel makeup and made sure that i had the right color of foundation to match my skin tone .
I was not really looking for anything in particular , just wanted to browse and see if anything catches my eye .
There was not much merchandise on the floor , which is out of character for barneys !
It was not until i wanted to buy something did i realize that the entire time i was in the store , that there was no sales associate to be found .
He looked really busy , like he was playing clash of clans or something so i decided not to bother him and left .
I had wanted to stop into the pretzel shop for a while and had heard they also serve sandwich and not just pretzels .
It was so moist and doughy , and not too salty ( which i hate about regular ones ) .
If something goes wrong they do not have to take it out on the customers .
It 's such a shame , their buys are always good but due to the lack of service ; i will never drop a dime there !
No wonder more and more people and shopping online nowadays .
It 's no wonder the staff changes faster than the seasons !
Sometimes circumstances take you out to neighbourhoods that you do not usually visit .
If you are looking for a 50s diner experience than look no further than this restaurant .
The fried pork was tender and not tough .
The fried egg rolls were ok , not my favorite .
Little to much wrapper and not enough ingredients .
The root beer float is hugeee my straw could not reach the bottom without tilting the mug .
The service was also really good and i did not have to wait long for my food .
The cashier does not know but points me to the sign with the password on it .
So i try to connect for the next 20 minutes to their wifi and the public wifi with no luck .
I can go to abuelos and spend 40 dollars or i can go somewhere else , but i really like the " no hassle " service .
I do not ever need to wait for a table .
I never have ever had a problem here .
Not the greatest service , that 's for sure .
Pros : $ 1 tacos on tuesday , free chips and salsa , the tacos come out fast and are always filling cons : they take a long time to give you the check , wanted my change ( so i can tip properly and never got it ) other than that i love the place , i frequent when i can , mainly tuesday 's lol but i 'd recommend this place to anyone , only took a star off for the cons .
A lot of construction workers eat here but that 's not a an issue honestly .
Not everyone is a craft beer drinker and drinking a glass of bad pinot out of what looks like a baby food jar did not make me want to stay for another drink .
The bartender had a nasty attitude and disappeared right after pouring my wine and sat in the back talking to a waitress the rest of my visit ... horrible customer service skills .. i was excited their was a place on my way home i could stop for a drink after work , but i will not be returning .
Not so much .
The men were what you 'd expect , but , the women , not so much .
Normally i would not grade on this , but it was that remarkable .
As another reviewer mentioned , the food is not your typical bar fare , but delicious smoked meats and home cooked sides .
Even better than the food was a specialty drink called " make my mule mexican . " at first i thought this was tequila based , but to my delight it was not .
It 's a taste that can not be duplicated :
First visit today and probably will not be back .
No worries , since i wanted to ask my usual questions re food allergies .
I added that i 'd like to hear more about these seasonal items , especially that mango cheesecake , and she told me " oh , they are just something we do here ... we serve other items that you find in other coffee shops ... " hmm ... she did not seem enthusiastic about them .
No gusto , no enthusiasm regarding this delicious - sounding drink , so i stopped considering to get one , told her i was waiting for a friend , and took a food menu to read at a table nearby .
Both are made with sourdough bread from a shop " that starts with an " m , " so i volunteered " mj ? , " and she said " yes ! " volstead ( or is it the nile now , since the coffee cups have " the nile " printed on them ) uses two types of mj bread - sourdough and multi-grain , and while she did not have ingredients lists , she thought that the sourdough would not contain any corn in it .
The barista also checked and told me that the boysenberry jam did not contain cornstarch .
Why tell me one thing and feign no interest in the drinks and then speak and act another way to someone else ?
I actually said these words to friend in front of the barista , who pretended she could not hear me , and friend laughed a little .
Ok ... cup of cappuccino felt half - empty in it s small cup when i lifted it from the counter ( i decided not to even bother complaining about this ) , and i had to ask for butter and wait for it while she finished making a third customer 's beverage , even though the toast mentioned butter in its description .
Atmosphere was nice ( gothic meets hipster ) , but i did not appreciate how barista did not seem too enthusiastic about talking about the mango cheesecake iced coffee despite my interest in hearing more about it .
There were empty booths all around , so the kitchen was not slammed .
Definitely will not be going back or recommending this place to anyone .
Well , this was our first foray into the veg sushi world and we were not disappointed .
I had no idea some of these things existed .
And my sometimes soy - sensitive tummy did not give me any troubles afterwards , which tells me it 's quality ingredients .
The chicken substitute was not fried , which i like , and the cheese was some of the best i have had .
I am not a fan of ranch , but i actually found myself dipping my sammy into it a couple times .
It 's a high end store , what do people not understand about the price ?
Although i can not afford to shop here , i am sure those who can will appreciate the perfect service and attention to detail .
2 ) i did not try any food .
I did not find what i was looking for in volstead . ambiance :
I did not like being there .
With the huge open area filled with tables , smaller intimate tables near the front window , and the side bench table , there 's no lack of space .
I am not sure what theme they are going for , but i would not have been surprised if i saw the adams family sitting by the defunct fireplace .
I approached the front to put away my dishes : no words from the chatting baristas .
I leave : not a single word .
I do not expect too much from coffeeshops , but being treated like perhaps they appreciate my business is the minimum .
It was not hot .
It was warm , but not freshly made hot .
Now i appreciate when drinks have ' body ' , but this had no flavour aside from an almost acidic taste .
I was wary of each sip , but could not throw it out because ... student .
It was not clean .
I can not !
Even my mom was amazed that what she was eating was not actually real shrimp !
I come here for lunch and dinner and have never ever been disappointed !
We probably ordered too much food but it 's hard to decide when you live far away and do not know when you will be back .
This was our second visit and we stick to the japanese menu and ordered things we can not get at home .
A note to vegans - the items on the menu with cream cheese are not labeled with the red dot meaning " contains eggs or dairy " but i do believe they are made with dairy cream cheese .
The philadelphia roll came without cream cheese so i can only assume the cream cheese is not vegan .
It may end up a rich gooey mess on my plate , but it 's not going to start out that way .
There 's typically a wait but i know there 's an option of setting an appointment that just does not always work with my schedule .
Highly recommend all discount tires and if this is the one close to home you are not going to go wrong .
Not too busy and great food .
Avocado delight was a great appetizer for 2 and no carb .
My wife 's tires were nowhere close to being dangerously low and did not need replacement at this time .
Was not satisfied with my food yesterday .
Definitely was not happy about it .
Never again will i come here .
Store . if i had a million dollars , i 'd blow it all on a cocaine binge ( kidding ! ) and this place ( not kidding ! ) .
I am not going to sermonize you , but i know staying away from blood diamonds is important to some .
Overall , i think my favorite thing about barneys is that they do not skew ostentatious .
I am really happy this store is in vegas ..... although i can not afford 90 % of it .
I was expecting portions of brain as well ( but maybe after bovine spongi .. what not , it s probably safer that i did not ) shrimp : bit overdone ( hence rubbery ) but with a good griil aroma and flavor .
Unfortunately , michelle did not come through for me last night .
When i texted her , she never responded .
She was so unprofessional and i will never use her as a promoter again .
She was not up front with me at all and i am disappointed that she got credit for my group being on her list at all .
The worst thing is that it was the last night my out out town friends were here , and i was talking about how much fun the club would be since they had never been to anything like it before .
We ended up leaving and going downtown which was actually fun , i just wish we did not waste two hours getting to the encore to wait in line and not even be allowed to get inside of the club .
Do not use this promoter !
Can not knock it !
Not in a bad way though .
It was dry and gristly , and the sauces served with our meal could not save it .
They were excellent and not too loud , so we could enjoy our conversation all night .
We waited for our drinks for 30 minutes and then did not get our food for an hour .
I will never go again .
Not only you get salted or unsalted pretzels but they also have stuffed pretzels and even pizza pretzels .
Do not be fooled by imitations .
We got there at 7:55 am the parking lot was empty and there were no lights on inside at all .
The time on the door said 8 am so we waited but there was no sign of life .
Will not go back there again since it is clear they do not know how to run a business .
They saved me from not coming to them at all .
We had such a bad experience there that we almost did not give market st a second look .
The quality and portion justify the price with so many options that are sure to entice we were lucky to not have to wait in line and we had a cozy booth for our party to dine tasso and the jukebox team were simply impeccable how they handled that blackout was nothing short of respectable dylan stanley , a busboy , remember that name this kid and his voice are destined for fame !
I do not think diner food ever needs to be this expensive ... but i get it , so i will be back , but i hafta dock a star .
Wish that the jukebox did not have the option to play modern songs because it was awesome listening to the good ol oldies that did play while we were there .
This is not a hole in the wall , the place is very clean and the great service i get surprises me every time .
No , the brand red hot sauce , not ... i do not even want to know what you were thinking .
The sandwich : fell apart a bit , would not get it on sourdough next time if another option was available .
Do not waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza -- all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event : the pretzel !
Only complaint : not open late enough .
The salad came with a balsamic vinaigrette , so nice and sweet but not too sweet .
In my quest for the perfect cup of coffee , i found exactly what i was not looking for .
I almost always can find parking right outside the shop since it 's not in the crazy crazy part of east carson .
It 's such a simple shop , with no gimmicks .
This location had my mom waiting for more than two hours to get her one tire replaced , when it should not have taken that long .
Nice atmosphere , good drink specials , and not too expensive !
- no chicken .
- no tilapia .
Not only is it full of character and mood lighting , but they have a 100 % vegan menu .
I obviously would not be a millennial if i did not order it .
The coffee is good , not great , but suits me just fine for an afternoon of working and snacking .
I had been searching for a particular pair of louboutin boots and could not find my size anywhere .
I absolutely love tenon , cause it was the first vegetarian and vegan japanese restaurant i have ever been to , and it 's not super far ( like in downtown ) .
My friend had a tofu pad thai and the portion size was pretty big , so she could not finish the whole thing .
Yes , i did ..... first off , as other yelpers mentioned , this is a " hidden gem " and not only is it off the beaten path , it is so far off the path , that the path disappears , you hit b.f.e. , then go another 100 miles ..... my experience was totally yelp random .
Bacon is to die for , i could live on their bacon alone . kielbasa was to be expected , pretty good smoked flavor ( i am not a kielbasa expert ) .
One bitch , it s small and not really shareable .
Not very authentic .
The fillings , on the other hand , did not impress me -- while filling , they were bland and flavorless .
This has never happened to me before .
She treated us chinese people as if we were not customers .
I have never had someone so rude to me in my entire life as me being a customer .
They never fail to get us in anywhere we want to go and always get us free drink tickets !!
Everything always goes smoothly when dealing with them and you know that 's not an easy thing to find !
Will not go back ... totin 's down the street is a better choice .
Usually good service but not today !
I have never had issues with the customer service until today !
1st time & definitely will not be the last !!!!
Order the nachos or wings the do not disappoint !!
My chimi was understuffed , came with almost no toppings except the bottom quarter - sized tomato slice that most people throw out , a laughable amount of beans , and some lettuce shreds on the side that had a distinct chemical - flavor ... maybe cleaning solution from a counter ?
And no rice .
We did receive our meals quickly however there was not a whole lot of follow up on how anything was .
I would of believed them if it did not happen on another car brand .
So i was doing the no carb thing for awhile and my very first carb loaded meal was at chik - fil - a. one would think that after not eating carbs for a couple months , anything would taste divine ---- wrong .
I have not been back since and since i am on a new diet , i will not be heading there anytime soon .
After eating here since the beginnings of this place - i will not be back .
I do not know - but apparently the pretzel shop in the south side has found a way to mix in magic ... cuz hot darn these are some fantastic pretzels !
You will not be disappointed ( somewhere ... lou pappan is guaranteeing that statement ) .
We ordered tacos and the pastor was fair but the carne asada had no flavor .
Oh and got ta buy the guac separate ( muy triste porque sin guacamole no son tacos lol ) the one thing i really liked though was the salsa with the chips , i approve of that salsa !
Why would anyone get tires at someplace that is not a discount tire ?
They have not changed .
He was most helpful getting my bow tie to make it come together ( not a clip on ) anyway he was patient and kind to help me out during a wardrobe crisis .
Our original server never came back to check on us , except to bring the bill .
We decided we were glad we tried it , but would not be back .
My husband did not want anything , so the kids and i cut the burritos into 3 and i got to taste each burrito .
They were not gigantic burritos like filiberto's , but they were a good size .
The place was nice and clean and no real issues .
Do not take your car here !
I can not wait to go shopping again !
This is not vanilla flavored maple syrup , it is vanilla syrup that pours clear .
Now on to what could make it better , with some of problems not being able to be changed .
It is a no frills décor restaurant with two walkways with tables on both sides , but the room just echoed terribly .
For a breakfast place , your coffee cup should never be empty .
In addition , our food was not very hot due to the fact that i stared at it sitting in the window for several minutes .
It really was not our waitresses fault since she was taking orders at the time .
By the time she took their order than got our food , it was not that hot .
We will probably try it again , but not go out of our way
I also should not have to pay that much for one tiny scoop of ice cream .
We waited until 8:20 and still no sign of life !!
Brought the in - laws here since they are from out of state and as usual , this place did not disappoint .
Spinach dip you can never go wrong if they have it , sometimes sold out .
I live nearby , and i had not been to mucho taco until a friend recommended it .
They also serve faux meat dishes and thai food , but i have not tried that yet ( except for the faux beef skewer which was good ) .
Not as big as l.a. but waaay better than san francisco .
No problem , we just moved over one booth , right ?
The entire seat cushion of the other booth was busted too , but it was a little more manageable - ( you just can not move - at all - while seated ) .
If i order a preconfigured burger that has warm caramelised onions or warm chili , do not put the cold tomato and raw ring of oinions in the burger , too !
Ours were cooked medium , borderline medium rare , which i am sure they were not going for .
Curly fries were tasty and could have been better if they were not so cold and overly crunchy ( made it unplesant to eat a lot of pieces ) .
And i do not mind paying 12 $ for " a " burger , because it 's actually real food .
And i probably will not eat - in .
For the record , this place is not trying to be johnny rockets , the shake and the burgers are much more fresh and of higher quality .
And this place is not expensive for families - you just have to know how to order .
Burgers and shakes are good for two - do not be shy - ask for an extra glass and a proper knife and portion your food - because this restaurant is not looking after your wasteline .
Obesity was not an issue in the 60's .
Michelle and kayla were so helpful in planning my nightclub guest lists i do not know how i could have done it without their service .
I had not been to vegas before so i did not really know what to expect , but luckily my friend sent me the name of their service .
At elmer 's up the street it 's more expensive and you do not get chips .
No problem try like me ( see picture ) the great chicken waffle sandwich southern confort !
This too is amazing & you do not feel rush even if they rush !
Why can not the other fast food chains get it right like these guys ?
My wife and i diplomats in your country and we what we experienced was definitly not canada like .
We will not be visiting any time in the near future and will not recommend this place to anyone else .
Not this location !
Waitress was not around to greet me so i took off to get my breakfast , because she did not greet me i did not get to find out that becasue of my age i could have gotten my meal for $ 10.99 instead of $ 12.99 , i am older than 55 .
Sausage , bacon , hash brown bake were good , biscut - gravy and scrambled eggs not so much .
This seems like it 's not a big deal but do some research and trust me it matters .
The owner , michael has no secrets and everything he uses he 's got for sale for customers - top coats , scrubs , instant dry oils , lotions .
My tech did an awesome job and i was given a discount i did not even know was coming and my broken nail was fixed for free !
Can not beat the customer service .
No matter how my day is going i leave the shop with a smile on my face .
You can not find better juice flavors anywhere .
Not that i have tried to cause i am loyal , and we have a good thing going lol .
Did not finish everything because i did not want to be stuffed .
If you have to go here , only go when the owner is here ... otherwise you will be left to feel ignored and not given what you need .
They do not charge for builds on your rba's , but you can give them a tip if you so desire .
The only downside to ed 's is the constant lineups that extend out the door , but since their service is fast this is really just a testament to how good their ice cream is and not an indicator of a inefficiently run shop .
I can not say enough about dr .
Now if that does not say how great this place is , i do not know what does .
Tip the man please because he deserves it and seems like he could not be happier to put together your omelet .
Can not speak for the peach , but the blackberry was delicious .
Tasted fresh and not too sweet .
I had to go up to someone working and tell them .. there did not seem to be a hostess yet it said please wait to be seated ...
We were seated in the " added on " room which did not have any of the decor like the main room .
A buffet was going on for a children 's birthday party so the atmosphere was not what i hoped .
The staff as a whole is awesome , i would not go anywhere else .
The wait time has always been quick , and my time spent with dr. stone and tina have never felt rushed .
While i had the cheese steak , which was phenomenal , and the nachos were decent , the waitress i had was not as good .
Not the friendliest attitude at all , and when i asked for a refill , i never got it .
Seems like a good sports bar , but definitely not the greatest
I have incredibly sensitive teeth so cleanings can be painful but every time i go in kristen is so careful and i experience little to no pain .
I have been going here for 3 years and do not plan on changing .
Oh sure , you can double up on scoops , but come on , i am not an animal ...
Ed 's real scoop is no exception to this annoyance .
Spoiler alert : you will not .
She was very nice and did a great job but she did not wear gloves , and would blow on the wax before putting it on my face .. maybe it 's just me and my germ paranoia but i do not really like having a stranger 's bare hands ( and possibly spit particles ) all over my face .

I have never gone to the same nail salon twice .
We were seated , i went to the bathroom and came back and no drink orders were taken .
The bites were not on her arm before we sat down .
I have had some bad dentist in the past that were rude and grump jerks , this is not one of those places !
I do not normally write bad reviews but this i feel is necessary .
They would " suggest " different oral care toothbrushes like the sonic care and then a prescription mouth wash where they did not bother telling me the price of it until i got to the front to pay .. which was about $ 50 not covered by my crappy insurance .

And then they told me i have a cavity but did not show me the x - ray of it and asked me when i would be available to get that done .
I am still bothered that they did not show me the x - ray of that cavity .
Needless to say i will not be returning and hope to find another dentistry who actually cares for their patients .
It did not seem like your standard dental office at all .
They were very generous with the plating and i could not finish all of my food .
What 's not to love ?
A note to spice wimps that the dish is not too hot on the scale .
If you are someone that often needs a refill of coffee or water , this probably is not the place for you .
Most servers are friendly at least , but one of the women that runs food orders is not only not helpful , but is rude and dismissive .
My server then came out , but there was still no side of fruit .
In my six years here have not found a great chicago pan or deep dish pizza ...
An earlier review claims it is not chicago pizza , they are so wrong ... the sauce and sausage are on point .
It is not an inch and a half deep dish ... but finally a solid chicago pan ...
Do not miss out on this place and if you get the cinnamon roll top it with nuts and raisins ...
You will not be disappointed !
Do not let the decor and simple building fool you !
It may not be as fancy as over easy or decorated like hen house , but it 's soooo much better than both !
Btw , for those that can not stand public bathrooms , like me , you will be impressed with this one .
They have pennants from probably every college in the state not to mention the giant hawkeye banner on the wall .
The home fries were deep fried not skillet fried which made for an even golden brown color and a surprising crispiness .
My husband and i we nt here on a neighbor 's suggestion , no disappointment here !
I like that the crust is a little crispy and does not get soggy like rosati 's .
Can not wait to try more of their menu !
It definitely does not have the atmosphere of a cafe , but this is likely because it is so large !
That was not the case .
I am very particular about how people paint dark or red colors because if you do not paint it on correctly , it is very noticeable .
The only thing that i was not a fan of was their parking .
The flavors and toppings are consistently good - only problem is they are not rotated very frequently .
This place is better than touti gelati down on queen st but it is not a heart - winner either .
I saw many good reviews but maybe these folks do not know what a real ice cream is like , nothing compares to italian gelatos or other european ones .
I ve tried the blueberry icecream , i think they too , use artificial flavours , did not feel like blueberry at all , and no fruit pieces blended in it ...
Quick and friendly service and i might go again but only bcuz there is no where else to go in this area !
( the ice cream shop right on the beach is even worse ) their prices are bit lower than touti gelati , here i paid 4.20 for a medium 2 scoop cup the other place is over 6 dollars ... they use way too much sugar and i do not think sugar makes the ice cream good .
Being a transplant from chicago this is great food and does not disappoint .
I was a little surprised that it took 30 minutes to make a small thin crust cheese pizza , but next time i will just call it little bit earlier .. not a big deal .
Great food , friendly staff , and a market full of food you can not find in other grocery stores , you can shop while you wait for take out .
Could not have been any better !!
One of my gripes with many places is that they use cheap disposable clearos for their juice samplers so you do not get the best of flavors and a few were tasting burnt .
I had a question but did not want to bother either .
It was close to closing so i do get it in a way they want to have things ready to go , but it may have made a difference in a purchase from us or not faster .
I did not look at the gear to be honest since i was on a time crunch so i can not say what type of items they have .
We go weekly and have never had a bad experience .
Good selection on the menu , have never been disappointed !
Not only was this some of the best middle eastern food i have had in phoenix , but it 's rates right up there with some the best food ever !
They do not let you get your own samples .
The icecream here is good but not as good as some other places in the city .
Definitely check it out if you are in the area but it 's not really worth a special trip .
I gave one less star because the last two times they would not deliver ( once they said they were short staffed and once they had a big catering order and fell behind ) .
Not at tiptoe .
I am hesitant to rave about this place because i do not want tiptoe to become too crowded !
He help figure out the problem with my new e-cig even though it was not purchased in their store .
Their pork tenderloin is my favorite , and it is not a health food .
Last night , no exception to this trend .
There are plenty of fresh fruit options in their bar and the graham cracker topping is not " weapons grade " ( aka so finely ground that you choke the minute you try to eat it as you subconsciously inhale it directly to the back of your throat ! argh ! ) all in all : pleasant , clean and tasty .
It was not played well , just kind of slopped all over the plate with a watery absolutely flavorless yellow something i would not even recognize as hollandaise sauce on top .
The biscuit gravy was delicious but when brought out had that not so nice under the heat lamp too long crust on it .
I have not seen anything like this in any other dentist office .
There are a few employees that are not outright rude , but i get the sense they could not care less if i was in there or not , which is disappointing .
Lots of toppings , things i 'd never otherwise thought to put on ice cream .
It tasted alright not something i will ever order again .
I will not eat here again that is for sure .
The only disappointment is that i can no longer buy higher than 6 mg juice in store which makes it less convenient .
The decreased convenience will not stop me from enjoying my favorite puff flavors .
They had the midwest hospitality that no place out here has !
Smooth and creamy , does not melt too fast , and the service is speedy ( and will deal with your indecisiveness because there are a good number of flavors to indulge in ) !
Well we got there and had to wait over 10 min and then they did not have a high chair for my daughter .
She brought over another chair and i looked at her and i said my daughter is 2 that is not going to work .
She did apologize but offered us no other alternative .
My daughter had to sit on my husband 's lap or my lap because we never did get a highchair !!!!
After over an hour i did see that i highchair finally became available and they never even offered to see if we needed it at that point !
It overall seem like they were overstaffed and completely unprepared for the amount of people although i know that they have had father 's day and mother 's day brunch is before so it 's not like they did not know that this amount of people were going to be there !
Pretty empty , lacking specials / promos , and servers are not perky .
I have heard about them for years , but just never went in until i arrived on my first night in this city .
Might not want to load up on heavier toppings as it is sold by weight , but i had fun being allowed to create my own treat .
Have not been to the dentist in a little while .
I was able to get a 3d view of my entire head and they not only help with teeth but they explained they make mouth guards if you grind your teeth and guards that helps keep your airway open if you have sleep apnea .
Luckily i did not need this but i thought that was awesome for a dental office to provide that .
Dr brown did my crown , it was pretty awesome because i did not have to come back 5 times to get a crown fitting .
Pink spot did not carry the new subtank by kangertech and puff was the only store in the area that carried it .
The best part was that after all the hype my wife realized the subtank was not for her and later that night we returned it for a different tank .
The asian guy gave us no hassles on the return at all .
I have been several times and have never had an unpleasant experience .
Not a single detail was missed !
I truly can not say or think of anything negative about this place or the people !
The waitress did not come back for about 20 min .
During this whole time , our waitress did not once come to our table .
No updates on the order , no apologies for the delay .
There was no apology at all during the whole visit .
I have never experienced such slow service before .
The food was good , but not worth the wait .
I would have understood if the service was just a little slow , but it was really slow and receiving no feedback over the course of an hour and no apology whatsoever prohibits me from giving more than one star .
Getting stranded and getting to meet all the local staff and fire department raising money for charity while pleasantly watching the sun set at the outside bar was not the worst thing after all .
I came in looking for a particular product and could not see 5 feet in front of me when i came through the door .
Not the best way to run a serious business , and those parents should be ashamed of themselves exposing that baby to all that vape / smoke / whatever it was ..
If you have not had this flavor it is amazing !
They not only set me up with 30 ml juice but they also put new cotton on both of my rda 's .
I did not like the meat that came with the food .
The waitress looked at me strange and said " we do not do substitutions .
Unfortunately it did not have enough ice .
Not very impressed about that .
My hot garlic is not as hot as i wanted but very tasty .
This place got packed when several large parties came in for graduation celebration with no reservation .
Unless you are 70 or older do not come here .
They are very slow and if you are under 70 it seems they do not want you in there .
I suggest going to village inn instead do not waste your time or money
Not to mention the space is fun and very clean , which is really what is most important .
Since then , i can not seem to stay away - sunday 's venture was the third time in two weeks .
No , you will not find the best middle eastern food in the world at al - hana , but you can not go wrong with a $ 3.99 chicken shwarma sandwich .
The chicken shwarma sandwich was really good , the falafel - not so much .
Maybe spinach is not the first ingredient you 'd like to find in a pie , but these will change your mind .
Do not bother coming here if you are looking for a fancy sit down meal .
It 's completely no -frills , but completely tasty .
I really do not think instruction had been provided in how to make espresso ... and this was a significant failing that prompts me to round down to 3 stars rather than up to 4 . the servers were quite friendly and the shop has a nice , comfortable feel .
Overall , it 's decent and hit the spot on a bike ride , but definitely not in the top 20 ice cream shops i have experienced .
While it 's not fine dining , it 's perfect for what it is .
It 's nice because the tables are not clustered together , and the combination of lights and windows give plenty of light .
I can not say i have fantasized about the food here after i have eaten , but i have never had any complaints either .
Could not cut it with a fork .
The other girl , a brunette , was almost no where to be found and did not want to help anyone out .
It 's rare to find ground meat - even chicken - that does not taste like it 's bathed in oil and fat .
Not crazy about the garlic sauce ( it 's clumpy and a little bland ... tastes almost like regular butter to me ) , so i just dipped mine strait into the hummus instead .
( we took a peek at the deli while waiting for our food , and the fresh lamb looked outstanding ! ) and imo the surrounding neighborhood does not seem that sketchy to me .
The eggs were fluffy and he did not skimp on the ingredients .
I did not care much for the potatoes or bacon / sausage but overall it was a very good meal for $ 14.95 per person ( $ 6.99 for kids ) but the service was just ok .
Like i said , we had a great waitress and the omelet guy was friendly , but the greeters , the ladies serving coffee at the front desk and the rest of the wait staff did not seem to want any part of customers .
We may try this again because i love a good , tasty breakfast buffet , but with other options it will not be our go - to place .
I have been to so many different chiropractors and other practitioners over the past 15 years , and have never experienced such a thorough approach to health , wellness and recovery .
It 's always busy when i visit but i do not really mind .
Food comes out fast and hot and the servers always make sure your drinks are never empty .
Not even a week later , one of the batteries that i paid a good amount for stopped working .
If i do not like them , i do not offer it to them " and she laughed .
He was awesome , but when he is not there to monitor his employees , i think the whole demeanor changes :/ unfortunately , i will not be returning to make any further purchases after my experiences .
I have never been refused a visit in phoenix before for an actual appointment while actually waiting .
Friendly staff line is never too long .
The last time i was there i was the last customer to leave , at no point did my nail technician make me feel rushed or not as important .
Can not complain too much
Pro tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned .
I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant .
I probably would have not tried this place otherwise .
She numbs you up so you do not feel a thing :) and if she thinks you might need some major work done ( i.e. root canal ) she lays out the options for you so you know exactly what to expect .
I have had four dentists since i have lived in lv but will not need another .
I really like the modern feel of it and not the typical nail salon feel .
I was even offered cold drinks when i arrived and it was not super crowded and flooded with people at this time .
Either way glad yelp lead me to this location and so far not disappointed .
My girlfriend loves the spicy chocolate gelato they have ( she says she thinks it 's got actual ground peppers in the recipe to give it that kick ) and i have not gone a single time without rocking at least 1 scoop of the cherry gelato .
If you like gelato , and you like cherries , then i fail to understand why you would not have had this flavour yet .
Ok , so it 's not cheap .
My husband , a fan of the taylor 's made right in iowa , feels that their loose meat sandwich is good but does not compare to the original .
The biscuit was not good enough to tempt me to eat the carbs .
All in all , we would not seek it out but would not be opposed to coming here if someone else wanted to dine here .
Ordered large salad large pizza family pizza and spent $ 70 ... there were 6 adults who were so hungry we had to order more from a chain restaurant ... family size pizza not very large
I spend a lot of time working out and not a lot of time resting or recovering .
His massages are not what i would call relaxing , but they effectively cover all the muscles i need massaged and he helps stretch me out and release tight joints .
I have never been to a cleaner and more comfortable dentist office in my life !
I chose my eggs yo be cooked over hard , and whole wheat toast with no butter , and orange juice .
When our waitress btought by our check , we asked if they had michigan four - berry pie ( being a midwestern cafe , i thought maybe ... ) she said they did not ... we talked for a bit about the amazingness that is a four bery pie , paud our bill and left .
I do not know which is bigger ?
I have no idea what happened but they looked after me and they even called the paramedics for my safety .
If you so anything in life do not go here ever .
The rest of the food there is pretty much what you would expect from a midwestern greasy spoon , but the pies ... oh the pies ... the only downside to writing a review about their pies , is that the english language does not have words to describe how utterly amazing they are .
Closer , but not close enough .
I had no experience with the pt side of things , but being that i work in a pt clinic here in washington , the facility is huge and seems very nice !
She does not rush you and really takes time to find out what is going and wants to get to the root of the problem .
She does not just try to mask the pain .
Not a big fan of the yogurtology flavors , but they have quality ingredients , friendly employees , fresh fruits , and lots of sweets to add on .
That 's a high rating because i am no a big fan of ice cream but this place is heaven .
You need to come and try this bar that is not on a normal street corner .
I have not had bar food this diverse , unique , and tasty in a long time .
I we nt here to look for a better vape mod because my mod is not working properly , a guy named mike give me a great deal and made the happiest guy today ..
I highly recommend their mint flavored yogurt , you can not go wrong !
The gelato and ice creams are made fresh in house and you can tell it 's good quality , because the texture is very dense and does not melt as easily as the store - bought stuff .
Ice cream overall did not live up to the hype .
I love this salon but i do not intend to spend all my off days getting my nails repaired .
Not surprising since tip toe was recommended by a friend .
They did not offer any coupons or anything either !
Pizza was mediocre , pasta was super bland , the breadstick ends were so hard you could not eat them , and there was hair in the free dessert !
Definitely will not be eating here again .
My husband is a big pizza guy and was not impressed .
The first time , no one answered the phone and the line was out the door ...
This is not a sit down place .
I felt the crème brûlée should have had some crispy caramel pieces on it , not just vanilla and caramel flavoring .
It 's a small store and gets crowded really fast during the spring / summer months , it does not make sense to have tables and chairs inside the store during that season .
I have never felt pressured to get work done and have always been given options on payment plans .
We stop in 2 - 3 times a month for dinner and we are never disappointed .
All in all you can not go wrong at rivals !
I really hope this is not the best chicago has to offer .
About 5 mins after we ordered , we were told there was no more italian beef .
It s friday night ..... why do not they have a full menu ?
Pretty bad experience and probably because there was no leadership there what so ever .
Phoenix friends , if you like real pan pizza , do not waste your time and money at sanfratello's .
It was not .
We did not try the pie , which i hear is very good .
And for sure ... do not anyone order the turkey sandwich !
Yogurt not so good to me .
This is real pizza - not mass produced , chain restaurant style pizza , ie great quality .
I would not think of going anywhere else .
No more orders came in but the fact is that they let them go first .
The pizza is not that good and is expensive for what you get .
I hesitate to even say anything good about this place because it was really good , and now everyone will go here ... but i just can not keep it all to myself .
No appointment , but in desperate need of a gel mani and a regular pedi .
You can tell , this place cranks out mani / pedis like no other , yet , i absolutely was not rushed at any point during my visit .
Polish looked good and has not chipped after two days !
I do wish they had cleaned up my cuticles a bit more , but i will put that one on me for not paying attention and watching the food network on tv instead of looking at my hands .
There 's no other way to say it except that i will be back .
This is freshly made pizza - not prefixed delivered frozen to a store .
It 's not a rushed practice like many medical offices .
Not inexpensive , coupons online .
After being shipped rancid juice from this place , and absolutely no response from any of the emails i sent about it , i will never order from here again .
Do not get me wrong i was still hesitant to come bc i needed a full set and in the past no one could ever get my acrylic the way i wanted but michelle is amazing i am hooked , she was very pleasant and thorough with me .
All i can say is damn good thing i no longer live in the beach .
I have never been disappointed by following the pairing suggestion .
They actually put a little bit of marshmallow in the bottom of it , so that it does not leak any ice cream out the bottom .
Not to mention , their topping selection is vast !
Baklava , apple pie filling , full sized cookies ( not just bite pieces ) , cream puffs , jumbo marshmallows , and gumballs !
But when you take another look , you see that their red velvet and cupcake batter flavors were pretty weak and you can not get your own samples like some places , they have to get it for you ( which i do not like because sometimes i want to try all of them but i feel like i can only take two or they will tell me no more ! ) .
Due to the taste , it was not worth the money !
Ryan said something like this when we were there : " i do not think ' yogurtology ' was a very good name for this place .
It means that it 's the study of yogurt and you can not call it that when you do not know good yogurt . " hmmm ... well put , babe !
Normally , i do not give a business a second chance after reviews similar to what i left for sanfratello's .
The first thing is that it is not an easy place to find because it is literally buried in the mall .
In this case , i did not .
It did not have the full - bodied flavor i am accustomed to when eating a chicago pizza .
This crust was not buttery and even the tops were burned in spots .
All in all , i would say it 's not a bad pizza but this former chicagoan says it needs a few things that will turn it into a serious rosati 's competitor .
I love sweets , would eat them every moment , and i was struggling while eating it ( probably because of the earlier dinner ) , but anyway , it is big no matter what .
They offer variety of other stuff as well , as their own made chocolates , candies etc , so if you do not feel just ice cream , then there are other options for you available .
Do not let yourself down if you see a long line on a nice summer evening , as it goes pretty fast , as the girls at the register work real fast and hard .
I am not much of a smoker but decided to get a vapor anyway .
I especially will cherish the charming way in which the amanager ' grudgingly provided a refund for the food i never received .
You are no longer worth my affection .
Ugh. well the best place is not actually near phoenix , but i was not about to drive up 65 miles north to rock springs for their apple crumble , and then drive back here .
It was not a pie as much as it was a gloppy pile .
The coffee was stale and not very hot .
But this was not the case that morning .
He made us feel welcome and not like idiots ( like a couple of other shops in town ) .
He was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations and spent the time showing us how to properly use the product and had no problem answering any questions we had .
Even the other employees not helping us asked how we were doing and were very friendly .
Can not go wrong when looking for a great place to catch a game or have dinner with friends .
I m dining in the restaurant as we speak - note to self - do not come here again .
No thanks .
Not only does the ice cream have it s own unique texture , but the staff is fun .
It 's one of those places where you can have a little chat when it is not busy .
I am not disappointed with this place .
Never have had a less than exceptional visit at yogurtology ... thank you !
Excellent portions ( not too big - not too small )
There cinnamon rolls are awesome and do not forget to try some pie some time .
That said , i have seen a slight dip in service the last couple times which is why i did not give it four stars in case something is change there i do not know about .
I have been there lots of times , but no matter what time of day i go there are always annoying customers there that the managers do not seem to care about .
Tonight , there was a hoard of dvhs dancers who were half streaking and screaming so loud you could hear them from the freeway , no hyperbole .
Not that i blame them -- i get that they are customers , but this is a food establishment , not a jungle gym or strip club .
Not blaming the establishment , it 's just a fair warning that the establishment seems to draw in a lot of rude , immature teenagers that the managers do not even bother kicking off their property for fear of losing long term customers .
This seems to be a trend , as this is not the first time something like this has happened , either .
Getting back to their employees , there 's a girl who does not seem to be able to break change properly , ever.
She has not been working the register lately though , so maybe i am not the only person who 's noticed she 's not that great with money .
The place is clean , but not the cleanest place i have ever been to .. afew of the girls only clean major things like tables and floors while the side of the bar ( the side that you service yourself on ) has been gooey for me more than one time .
But i really do not like having to compromise a tasty frozen treat for unruly customers and rude employees who seem like they would rather shoot bamboo under their fingernails than ask me if i have a loyalty card .
Perfect spot to grab a bite before a ball game downtown ( not near the rail line ) .
I am so in love with the falafel that i still have not had a chance to try their world - famous cheese pizza thingies .
The only thing i am not 100 % in love with is the tabbouleh , which is just a tad short on lemon flavor for my taste .
This is not the relaxing fall asleep massage .
Heard about the biscuits and gravy , they were pretty good , but lacks service as i needed a refill on my water .... and have not received any water , probably under staffed .... coffee was not pleasant ...

I have never had a gel manicure last less than 2 weeks much less 1 week !
Usually my nails have a little wear on them after a gel mani starts coming off but it 's like they were never even painted .
That being said i have never been so pleased with service and the look of a gel mani , just sad they did not last as long .
Truly delicious pizza never disappointed when we order it always get delivery and they are always on time i highly suggest the chicago meat lover style as it is a grease lovers heaven and i mean that in the best most delicious way possible
Waitresses bus tables and do not wash hands .
Our food was good but the iced tea is not brewed it 's from the fountain .
I can not compliment them enough .
Please note there is no seating and no beer or wine .
Did not expect take out only based on reviews in arizona republic .
I did find the fact that they have breakfast sandwiches pretty unique and even though i did not get one personally , i heard the jo jo was delightful .
Now for the stuff i did not care for ... there was a guy doing construction work near the bathroom the whole time we were there .
Why they scheduled that during business hours is beyond me and if i had not had a six person party coming from all different directions to get together , i would have left .
Also the tea i had was not very good .
I realize it 's not their fault when all they have is bagged tea but i do appreciate a larger selection if that 's what you are going to serve .
Honestly , there could have been a very good reason for the construction work even though they did not bother to explain .
It could have been an off day and i would not mind giving this place a second chance in the future .
Does not honor appointment times -- i made an appointment for 6:00 pm and after waiting 40 minutes had to leave .
I only heard about baiz about a year ago but was hooked when i found that it had an enormous selection of middle eastern foods that you can not get at any of your common grocery stores .
Al - hana at lunch is usually a little busy , not too busy , but it will be about 10 minutes before your order is ready .
They are just the right size and will fill you up enough not to put you to sleep once you get back to your desk .
I too am not from chicago but really enjoy a good deep dish pizza .
Unlike some of the ones i have tried here in az , this one is of high quality and not too " bready " .
I hope so .... have had no issues with customer service , every time i have called in , the experience and pick up have been both efficient and friendly .
They also have some really great imaging technology and found things that other dentists have not found .
It was not even the same recipes .
My dining partner 's omelet was not anything to brag about either .
We will not be returning .
Did not care for the sales pitch for add 'l services such as invisalign .
One of the owners did my pedicure and it was the best pedi i have ever had - polish is perfect , very relaxing and not in a rush .
I will not go anywhere else .
You are never left in the dark .
I need to know my dentist is absolutely on the cutting edge of technology and not left behind like most dentists .
I also want a staff that is up to her caliber . this staff will never let you down .
No pressure , completely informative and perhaps the most well run office i have ever seen .
Not only my fav in ice cream but my fav business in the beaches .
I am not from chicago , but i have been to several of the key places that serve as true pure examples of " chicago - style deep dish " pizza .
Here in arizona , there 's not a ton of places to get a chicago deep dish .
It 's also kinda weird if you have not had it before .
Their pizza boxes are pretty unique - they do not require employees to spend hours of their day folding boxes ...
It 's a clever design that i have never seen before .
I honestly was not expecting too much from the pizza , but it was excellent .
It was a great example of a good chicago deep dish , but when i was done eating it , i did not feel like i had a giant brick in my gut .
Can not ask for much more .
Did not seem like it was super high in calories like other desserts .
Do not expect to bring the whole family for a sit - down meal . anyway , i like this place .
( sadly , not to me ) .
Well they do not give you much !
In the end i would not get the deep dish " pan " pizza again .
Not sure if i would even go back to try the thin .
Expensive pizza that just does not cut it .
If you are not a sc the only thing on the menu you can order is wait !
I have completely recovered , have no pain and i have better mobility than before i was injured .
The staff spend quality time informing every customer about product knowledge , vaping , and anything else you want to know about vaping . i have never seen a business that does a needs analysis on everyone that walks through the door , and scottie has a genuine concern in making sure that you succeed at getting off the stinkies .
The e-juice that they sell is the best in town , i have tried other bigger vapor shops in town and found out that bigger does not mean better .
No vegetarian soup selection ?
Quesidillas was good , but need a soup or something ... oh , no vegetarian soups .
Not only was the dental assistant very friendly , she made sure that i was comfortable and informed of every thing planned for my visit .
She constantly gave me options and suggestions and i never felt forced at all .
There is a small area for dinning up front that 's clean and not too cramped .
Most people order to go , so do not worry about seating when you see a lot of people at the counter .
I do not like how they have their menu .
Food ~ the spinning skewers of meat look and smell amazing , one beef and one chicken but no lamb ?
Thanks to the baba , we did not mind so much .
We had a group of close to 30 people and they handled us with no problems .
The food was excellent as well and the prices were not unreasonable .
I was told elsewhere i needed a root canal and dr. maria did not agree .
She took her time looking at my x - rays and examining my teeth to say she does not think a root canal is immediately necessary .
They have some cool stuff here and do not be afraid to hang out and vape with them !
Everyone tells me the owner is awesome but i have never met him .
Not a good environment for the over 25 vaper .
Definitely not worth the price .
The breakfast here is not only amazing but comes at an extremely fair price .
Eggs undercooked and french toast without syrup and never brought him his toast .
I do not recommend their buffet .
The meat section is not for the faint of heart .
To be honest , it 's hard to go wrong here -- i have yet to order something i did not thoroughly enjoy !
They do not go around and work on other patients and leave your mouth open for hours .
I did not feel no pain at all when i got a tooth extracted ...
I finally found a dentist worth going to and no longer afraid to go to the dentist !
It has a great coffee flavour , and it 's not too sweet like the hag daz i used to buy before i discovered ed's . the take home container is a great deal , especially with their frequent buyer cards !
Um , no worries for her because she dominated the rest of that menu , ordering a falafel sandwich [ in pita ] , za'atar bread [ dipped in labne purchased at the back deli ] , and six veggie grape leaf rolls .
I did not add cheese but it was an option ) .
I went there not knowing what to expect and found the plates to be packed to the edges , the service to be just enough without being pushy or disruptive and the check to be well within reason !
Was not even that busy and did not get greeted at the door .
Was not given napkins , and when seated first time they were putting us to a occupied table so had to wait another 20 minutes .
I never wrote a review for anywhere before but this was just unacceptable !!
The patio in the summer is great and the food never disappoints .
I have tried most of the menu and i have not had a bad choice .
In this difficult climate of trying to navigate one 's health care , this location could not be more helpful .
Go here and you will not be disappointed !!!
I have not been here in a few years only because i live kind of far from it and when i do have the time to get there it 's on the weekends for breakfast and then i will have driven a long way just to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table .
She also polishes all the way to the cuticle , so do not fret if you have tina !
Iowa cafe is one of those places i always saw and wished to stop but never did .
The restaurant website has a ' dine in ' menu and we did not see anything on the website saying that there was not an indoor dining area .
Yelp will not allow a review without stars so i am upping from one to three based on the website update .
Had pork chops dry over cooked briquettes pkg gravy left nasty taste in mouth , not good
Looking for an affordable breakfast in berea that does not disappoint on taste ?
Not only is the food a hit , but the service is good too .
I would have given five stars , but i am not a huge fan of how the dining area is situated .
This is not a place i would actually say lets drive out there , but a place you stop because your hungry , just passing by , and it 's convenient .
I paid $ 52.00 for two pizzas that were in no way related to the city of chicago .
My family and i will not be returning and i will not be recommending this place to my friends and family .
They did not take our orders until we were there for at least an hour .... and we waited almost 45 minutes to eat breakfast .
I will always be requesting s and i can not remember the lady name who did my nails but she was great too !!
It 's not a gimmick this place is great as well as the customer service !!
I ate at the location in mesa today and it was amazing , so i wanted to make sure to share the love on both yelps ( there is not an al hana page for mesa ) .
Mmmmmmmmmmm ..... i had my first waffle cone , it was so worth the extra $ 1.20 and the flavours .... the strawberry cheesecake was a bit disappointing but the creme brule and sweet cream ... omg and at the end i was not as thirsty and grossed out with myself as i usually am after ice cream - maybe because it 's made with real cream .
It 's not cheap though , for ice cream .
Not a ton of options on the menu , and i have only eaten breakfast here .
I recommend az spine and disc to everyone not just runners or athletes .
Asds .... there is no comparison with all that they offer .
It 's not just chiropractic care .
Not sure if the guy was new or not .
But my order was completely wrong and not complete .
I was not going to dare say anything .
There was no i am sorry or how did everything come out .
I will not be back .
Not crazy about the layout .
Probably will not be going back .
The place is clean but i did not receive the hospitality and great service that people are talking about .
It was clean but not as clean as everyone was bragging on here .
The thing that i did not like about the place is the girls that working their were not really friendly , they act like they did not like their job .
None of the girls had uniforms on , nor aprons on so it was hard to tell who was , and was not working .
Anyhoo , when we cashed out , i just could not believe that it was almost 11 dollars .
And she kept on insicting that we did not pay for it .
I am definitely not going there ever again .
My son had 3 visits in oct 2016 - he was not impressed the first time but gave it two more chances .
This is not what we were quoted .
No other business operates this way - can you imagine going to the store with no prices on anything , you find out at the register what you owe ?
We will never go back and we have told everyone on the team and the coach to never go there .
I did not see any sauce and the pizza was flavorless .
No one brought the drinks .. no one came by to say " hi , be right with you ... " nothing .
No one brought the drinks .. no one came by to say " hi , be right with you ... " nothing .
I do not know .
We never got any .
With cheap prices and traditional food , you can not go wrong . chicken shwarmas , babaganoush , hummus , falafel , pies , and kabobs are delicious .
But aside from that i did not really enjoy anything .
One of my pet peeves is not brewing your own ice tea , ice tea from a fountain is terrible , which is what i got from here .
The country fried steak seemed to be pre frozen and the gravy was so salty i was not able to eat it .
I do not think food is made from scratch at all .
The potatoes were just sliced and deep fried which were fine but not crispy like i ordered .
Overall they need to really work on the food , unless i hear they do a overhaul on the menu i do not think i would come back which is too bad because the atmosphere is somewhere i could definitely see myself hanging out for a bit in the morning to do some work .
The kids convinced me to come back here to get the pie that they have been craving and i was not wanting to go after the last visit but i did .
I do not know what happened but i have to say it was all as good as we experienced at the old location .
However after visiting tiptoe , i have never gone else where .
The staff there seems friendlier to iowans , or those who are not nyers .
I came here because of all the outstanding 5 - star reviews and was not as happy as i had hoped .
Well , i did not like how it turned out : very dull , with lines going through it , and uneven .
Also i asked for almond shaped nails and they came out very round with no point at all .
I got a pedicure too , and it was faded and not solid looking , with some spots missing .
I think that upset me the most , because it was 2 days later , and because i had never had acrylics before ( which they knew ) and they advised me to get regular polish , that it " should look just fine " .
I did not even mention the crappy pedicure .
Blah ........** per the owner 's response to my review *** no one fixed my toe polish because i never mentioned it .******* will not be back .
Blah ........** per the owner 's response to my review *** no one fixed my toe polish because i never mentioned it .******* will not be back .
First , no seating ?
Did not know that from the az republic .
No one , customers or two girls behind the counter knew what was up .
Pizza was ok , no more .
I do not know why everyone thinks everything from chicago is so great .
It 's not .
Do not get me wrong , love me some smoked or baby back rib .
The menu is huge which usually is a bad sign for me , no complaints on my plate .
Glad to find a local restaurant for breakfast that is not a chain .
Hashbrowns had a little too much oil , toast was not done enough .
Eggs were good , bacon was cooked properly but the flavor was not my favorite .
$ 1.89 . plus my first cup of hot water was not even warm enough to brew the tea .
Our server did not look like she was too thrilled to bring me some more hot water .
The woman on the phone would not give a rough estimate of what the exam or the dental work would cost even though i already had an exam and quote at another place .
She did not want to answer my question about the dental plans they offer .
We were looking for a new place to try for breakfast , and let me tell you , this excellent cafe / restaurant does not dissapoint !
My only regret is that we did not discover this gem sooner !
This has got to be the best vape shop i have ever shopped at all of the staff know what they are talking about and are not just out to sell you something for a commission .
The taste was good but i am not sure why people said this is the best in the city .
The price is good not expensive .
Service was a little slow but in the midwest people do not rush so gave you even more that midwest experience .
I know that when meeting with doctors you should not expect to be seen at appointment time .
It would not be bad , if they would call and let you know before you sit there for that long , but this is not the case .
Then i never got a call from the pharmacy .
No strips .
Should not be this difficult .
Still has not changed .
When you look in the window , you see ed 's famous gelato , and who does not like gelato ?!
I am assuming that they have not had the full on ed 's experience .
Do not go if you are in a hurry .
They have no order or process for what they do which is a shame because the food is worth it .
I am not a coffee drinker but i am told tje coffee is really good .
We ordered sanfratello 's pastas and pizzas for my daughter 's birthday party and we could not have been happier !
Visited here a few weeks ago with good intentions of trying their own beer but fat heads was doing a promotion here for their beer , so that did not happen .
He could have easily just sold me a new one to get the money but he did not , not only did not but fixed it for me !
From the first time he polished my nails ( as a walk - in ) i knew , at that moment , i would never go to anyone else !
I am also that lady that just brought her baby ( i would never do this on the weekend or after 5 , but i was desperate and we are going on vacation ) .
Always take good care of their customers and it 's not like you walk in without being greeted and have to figure everything out by yourself , which i appreciate that very much , other vape shops are not as helpful as this one !
In terms of food , i would really only give this place a 3 star rating because i did not find it to be particularly wonderful .
While waiting for drinks i was able to observe the eclectic and not entirely cohesive crap all over the walls and on the shelves .
I did not quite understand why some stuff was on the walls , but to each his own .
I walked in smelling the most pleasant smell and it was not ice cream .
I have not developed that ice cream smelling skill yet !
The decor is of dessert / ice cream parlour mooding with cow flying over the moon ( clock ) which is not functional .
However , after visiting this location the other night , i have to say , it really does not live up to my ed 's standards .
The windows are jumbled with old grungy signs and inaccurate business hours , and the inside is just cluttered with that feeling of a home that accumulates stuff over the years and never organizes or weeds down .
Do not get me wrong , the ice cream , gelato , milk shakes , etc. , are all delicious .
They really take their time on each customer and do not rush through the experience .
100 % would recommend to friends and will not be going anywhere else to get my mani 's and pedi 's !
Not too sweet and full of flavour .
No artificial colour or flavour !!
But i recommend this location because staff were all very nice and provides a more comfortable not crowded eating environment .
Mmm i wish i was there right now . * note - not really a sit down place , it s pretty small / narrow to accomodate a long line but who eats ice cream inside anyways , esp. when you could be walking on the boardwalk :)
You can not find pizza this good anywhere here , trust me we have tried .
My only complaint is that it 's not closer to my house so we could go more often .
Give this place a try , you will not be sorry !
The drinks and snacks are nice as something complementary but i still did not feel relaxed leaving the place .
My friend 's gel polish was uneven and was thicker by the edges of her nails , and when she commented on how they looked , they said it was the polish but did not say anything else about fixing them .
I would agree that it is hard to go wrong with froyo but i absolutely do not think all frozen yogurts are created equal .
Not only that , yogurtology is immaculately clean at all times and has very good customer service too !
P.s. if you have been to yogurtology and you did not at least sample the oatmeal cookie you have not been to yogurtology ... i advise going back now !
Pricey if you do not have insurance .
I am an ultra trail runner & have to admit that i do not do stretches / yoga on the regular , so definitely had some knots all throughout my body .
I can not comment on the gelato .
Three things to consider when ordering because if you have never had chicago - style pizza , you may not know the first two of these things :
It 's not crazy deep like you may see in chicago , but be warned , it 's thicker .
Unfortunately , that 's not our preference .
It did not particularly strike any chords with me , so i did not eat it .
I would not say they are particularly wow or outstanding - nothing sticks out - but they are acceptable .
I just can not say enough about this place .
Unfortunately , the problem i had was not completely fixable ( though scott got it working better than it had been ) .
It 's also the one scott uses and he has not steered me wrong yet !
I get it that they would like to sit 4 people at a 4 person table but i really do not want to wait until one of their little 2 person tables opens up so we can be jammed into it .
I do not expect to be put at a 6 or 8 person table because that would be weird for 2 people .
Fast forward a second time for another 30 minutes ; we have not been checked on , i ran out of coffee , and the table seated at the same time we were had received their food , ate , and were signing their bill .
After the strenuous feat of flagging down the waitress that took our order but was not her table , we asked for a bill for the coffee and told her we were leaving because we had a prior obligation we needed to attend .
She seamed very put off that after spending over an hour to attempt to order 4 eggs ( only half cooked so it should have been easier ) , a couple strips of bacon , hashbrowns , and toast ; she told us " its fine , do not worry about the coffee bill " .
And no apology offered .
Why did not that just take it off of the buffet ?
Whenever i dragged my friend to go on a eating spree with me , she always complains no matter where i feed her ... sushi ( hmm ) , cakes ( nahhh ) , burger ( oh not again ! ) foie gras ( oh ... not one of the hoofs ) ed 's real scoop is the only place that when i asked her if she want some ice cream .. she would have said yay !!

No patrons but us when we dropped by on this chilly sunday afternoon ...
I knew my friend really enjoyed her ice cream because she was licking her spoon non stop ... as she would not let any goodness to be wasted !
No judgement here , as i like to lick my plates clean too ! :)
After today , we will probably not be going back .
Though it really was not that busy , it took just over half an hour to get served .
It is very clean and bright , but very wide open and not very cozy .
The food is passable , so if you do not mind mediocre food and slow service , this is the place for you .
Also , they only offer a limited menu on sunday mornings , since they have the breakfast buffet then , so we have not gone back there on a sunday since we found that out ........ and now we will not be going back there at all .

This little spot in the baiz market is not located in the best part of town but is truly a gem .
Not so much but we definitely make the drive for al - hana .
Icecream does not get better than this .
There 's no run around or just looking to sell you the most expensive thing here , they want to ensure you are happy with your purchase .
I asked for " scott " the owner simply in hopes of getting the best pizza they make ... so if i did not enjoy it , i know it 's not that they made a bad pizza but because that 's how they make their pizza .
I do not mind paying a higher price but the food needs to warrant it ...
Although i have never seen a pan pizza cut in squares ... in the chicago i grew up in only thin crust is cut in squares ... but oh well ...
Does not effect the taste !
Not quite as flavorful as i prefer but nonetheless closest to home as i have tasted in az .
I give credit where credit is due ... of course i am guessing they get the sausage from a vendor and do not grind it themselves ...
I think we would try the thin pizza ... but not pan !
Parking is never ending .
I have never left feeling worse after treatment and always enjoy going to see dr rudd when i am in need of treatment because i know he will fix me up !!!
She did not apologize and just put some blue liquid on it and then painted the cut with clear polish which i thought was weird .
She then did the rest of my cuticles and when she buffed the nails she was not gentle with the one she cut and painfully reopened the cut .
The manager did not ask me how my visit was either .
You can not beat the prices , and i love that you can order breakfast all day every day .
Tastes exactly as it should : delicious ) - french mint ice cream ( similar to a mint chocolate chip - can not go wrong ) - pumpkin ice cream ( seasonal - so flavourful and spiced !
I can not wait to try more .
It 's clean , brightly - lit and there is adequate amount of seating inside and out on the benches facing the street - but i have never really seen anybody sit inside .
Will not recommend nor will we be back .
The worse breakfast place for kids they do not let you sit in booth if you need high chair they say it 's health code which i know it 's not then what breakfast restaurant does not off box cereal for kids wow 1 breakfast and 2 kids pancakes $ 30 lmao i will stick with wild berry but they were closed today
I have worked good service and could understand if wait staff coverage was thin , but as we waited 15 min for someone to seat us , i noticed there were only 4 tables seated inside and about 8 waiters running around - so no problem with coverage .
This is lousy service and i would not give my money to place like this .
Never going back and would not recommend to anyone , unless you want to me made to feel that you are not allowed to go here .
I can not even begin to explain how great it was .
That being said , this was not haji - baba 's falafel sandwich .
It was slightly dry , had floursecent pink pickles ( i think they were pickles ) and the falafel balls were mushy - not crispy on the outside .
Going to the dentist is never something you look forward to .
My kids wanted different toppings so we asked to split up so we would not have to pay for 6 toppings .
Even if it had been half the price , the pizza was no better than a tombstone .
Never going back
I chose the flavour chocolate cheesecake and cookies and cream and they did not disappoint .
It has a nice atmosphere , good coffee and great breakfast i have not been in for lunch yet , but plan on it soon .
That way you do not have to hunt down the match to your gel color when you want regular polish on your toes .
Not super chatty , but i had no problem with that at all .
Leaving one star because zero is not an option !
There is not much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge .
I said nevermind because i was not going to pay that for a small container of condiment !
It was not impressive either .
In my opinion this was not worth 3.99 , but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was .
Do not go here !
Our previous dentist never mentioned all the work dr dee wanted and said our teeth were fine .
She got a new crown for $ 400 , not $ 600 .
I also went to a dentist about my implant and was told the tooth had good roots , was not loose and said no implant was necessary .
Let me start by saying that i have not been to a dentist in over 20 years .
There appeared to be a lot of horsing around , kidding around , and not much waiting on the customers .
When my husband and i both placed an order for a loose meat and french fries and a tenderloin to share , i got mine but he did not get his & the waitress said she misunderstood and had not put an order in for him .
The big disappointment though was the loose meat sandwich it was so dry that it was almost not edible and in fact my husband and i both left half of it .
Very disappointed in my iowa café as i have always considered it a little home away from home but this is actually the second time i have felt that their food was not up to par .
They also have really good pasta ( not sticky , gooey or stuff that 's been sitting around in a pan ) and stellar meatballs .
The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they have moved and not much else has changed .
The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan - totally unprofessional . after about 30 min. of watching " the kitchen window movie " we realized that we still had not gotten our food ( we ordered simple dishes : 2 egg / hashbrowns and i got a side of cinnamon bun french toast ) .
Umm no we did not ...oh and wait , stop , hold up ... let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast ?
After all the waiting and drama this place just is not worth it .
I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but i bet it was b/ c we were literally sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee ... ok so never mind she was not good either .
She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though i would have demanded that if she did not offer anyway .
I am really not a fan of microwaved eggs so i thought i 'd pass that nugget along .
My gel nails have never looked better !
The potato twisters are kind of like a nacho platter made with a base of curly potatoes ( not really fries exactly ) covered with cheese , tomatoes , sour cream , etc. the potatoes had a burnt oil taste making them less than appealing .
Two issues there ... not enough sauce , and some of the wings were so large that they were underdone in the center .
Not the meal we were hoping for , maybe it was just an off night ?
I will not go anywhere else !!
Ok , i am not used to getting so much tasty food for so cheap .
While some of the reviews described an eatery that seemed to good to be true , i have never been disappointed by any establishment recommended by my fellow reviewers so i knew i was in for a treat .
Another place that i am kind of glad is not too near where i live ... otherwise i 'd be constantly overeating .
These are not soft relaxing fall asleep massages .
I have never seen a group of people less welcoming .
No hello .
No nothing .
You sign in and they just act like you do not exist .
I did not get to see the patio but i did catch a glimpse of some pictures .
I practically yelled my order at the waiter so he did not misunderstand ... i clearly needed wings with that sauce on them .
Not a fan .
Run , do not walk , to tip toe !!
Noticed all the cars in the parking lot and knew there was not an outbreak of malaria nearby , so i assumed they were here for some other reason .
The place was pretty crowded and the lag in service was not due to people not caring .
Would not hesitate to come back again .
Best grocery in phoenix , great selection of fresh veggies & fruit , stuff you would not find elsewhere ( sweet red pepper , saturn peaches ) , amazing cardamon coffee , best feta cheese , etc. wonderful middle east market .
I have not tried anything else yet because i just love the pizza .
I met him and some other yelpers to sample some of al - hana 's wares and while there were a few strike - outs ( specifically , the hummus , which did not have enough garlic or lemon , and the tabloulleh , which had way too much parsley ) , the falafel sandwich , shwarma beef and chicken sandwiches ( both with garlic sauce ) , and cheese pies were all so flavorful !
The food is not that bad , although i have not tasted enough of the dishes ... the meat pies and chicken shawarma were the big deals for me and i really like them .
You need to come and try this bar that is not on a normal street corner .
I have not had bar food this diverse , unique , and tasty in a long time .
They always resolve my pain and do not recommend unnecessary treatment .
The pieces were small and had no hint of extra flavoring .
Been going to rivals for years and never have had a problem !
She sat on her shift and stood up to greet me with no personality .
Odd they need their own specific table and would take away from paying customers , but hey it 's not my establishment .
Not bad , but not spectacular either .
I could not find her and needed to get back to work .
Of course she could not , but would find my server .
This place is a diamond in the rough and we can not believe we did not try it earlier .
It even felt weird the first couple of days to wake up and have no pain , kind of something was missing but in a good way .
Because not every patient is the same or has the same condition , they look for the root cause of the problem and build a treatment based on those findings .
If you have never been to a chiropractor or have had negative experiences with others , give az spine disc and sport a chance , you will not regret it .
I never tried a better ice cream in my life !!
We got the raspberry white chocolate and it was so rich and creamy - which is never a bad thing !
There is always a line - up but who would not sacrifice 5 minutes of their life for ed's ?
Honestly , it was my first time and i did not even know we could get a topping for the ice cream .
I ordered entirely too much food to - go and was not disappointed by the price or taste !!
I would have preferred a bit more lemon , but was pleasantly surprised that they did not overload it with bulgar ( huge pet peeve of mine ) .
I 'd say it 's a standard hummus that will not blow your socks off , but is still certainly delicious .
They said they no longer do phone orders because people do nt pick up .
So why not take credit cards over the phone to ensure payment ?
I do not see any kind of takeout menu .
No one i 'd trust more than the amazing team at dee for dentist .
This was a sunday after charlotte had some inclement weather , so it was super busy in there , and i also got behind a bridal party , so my wait was rather long , but i do not feel this would be typical .
At the end , even though i was not getting gel , the tech used the uv light to help dry my nails faster .
They let you have a sample first to make sure you like the yogurt but there 's not one yogurt i do not like !
With a marshmallow on the bottom so the ice cream does not drip out .
Tried : burnt marshmallow ice cream - caramelly and not too sweet .
Not artificial green like regular mint chocolate chip ice cream .
Creamy texture , light and not too heavy .
Also , do not forget to try their " loaded " potato salad ... a unique take on a traditional side dish .
The shrimp ones did not have much shrimp flavor , or much flavor period .
Would probably order again but ask if i could make the whole order of 6 edamame potstickers and no shrimp ( and this is coming from a seafood and meat lover ) .
Yes i know it 's a " sports bar " but the workers should not assume you want to join them in a round of cussing .
I love my doctor ( joy wolfe ) - she listens to me , understands me , and is genuinely concerned about my welfare , not hurrying me out of the office to make room for the next patient ...
Needless to say most people preparing for a wedding / honeymoon , would not be interested in some work related patient .
The only flavor i did not care for was the red velvet .
I am the first to admit chocolate is never top on my list , but this seemed way too fake .
My mother can not have gluten so usually frozen yogurt places are a-ok for her but unfortunately some flavors here have some wheat in them , just an fyi to anyone also wondering .
( i am not gluten sensitive . )
They have lots of things you would not normally find ( hostess cupcakes , or lookalikes ! ) .
There 's plenty of parking as it 's nestled in a strip mall so you do not have to worry about that .
I have never had a bad experience here !
You will not be disappointed .
I had a tiny phobia of hygienists coming in , but after meeting row and seeing how gentle ( no silently writhing in pain ! ) , but thorough , she was , i was sold .
After falling for the fro- yo trend , which i swore not to , i decided to check out all of the frozen yogurt places out in the arrowhead area .
In search of the place that had the best quality , atmoshphere , and service , i could not argue with yogurtology being the best place to enjoy a nice frozen delight .
No lazy kids working here .
You can not go wrong with either of these .
I saw the dough they use for the pizza , it 's not preformed or frozen .
And for the record i like the piece in the middle with no crust .
There was even a dog underneath the bench i was sitting on and no owner around .
Very good pizza & anti-pasta salad , also the service was really good and can not wait go back !
Ai not nobody got time for that .
This place has only been open 3 weeks so i am the only one here on a friday , but i am sure it will not stay like that for long .
I had to get some olive oil and lamb chops becuase i could not pass up such a great deal and the meat looked very fresh .
Not very fancy but spotless clean .
The sandwich is served plain , which is not authentic taylor 's .
Even the mustard and ketchup at the table could not help it .
Perhaps , but i 'd never order that sandwich again .
I saw others eating huge portions seated at other tables , my lunch did not meet that description .
Although i respect that they will not allow us to get our own samples , i did not feel the employee was friendly enough to make my kids comfortable to ask .
The atmosphere was not as fun as the places back home .
The kids did not want to stay and eat .
Unfortunately , the service was not so good .
She informed me that their credit card machine was broken so i had to pay in cash .. no big deal .
She dropped my water off and did not come back to take my food order .
Instead of that server coming over , she yelled to someone else " is not that jen 's table ? " and i had to wait until they could get jen to come back to my table .
After i completed my meal , i asked jen for my check to which she replied " i do not know what i can do about that , our computers are down so i do not know how to get you your check . "
Jen had not come back to my table since to keep my updated .
Do not waste your time here .
She was not friendly , nor polite .
She should get a job that does not require customer service .
Tried so many places and flavors ... never was content until i discovered puff vapors !!!
I have no issues driving all the way up here to get puff 's liquid .
I never get tired of it and i never have enough of it .
I have been doing this vaping for almost 1 year now and i have not had a single ciggarette since day 1 .
Got my girl a sub - ohm clapton build there yesterday and it was set up and done in no time .
I peeked at the mod selection and it looks like they do not carry any junk or bargain bin mods or atty 's .
I have never had better baba ganouj in my life and the garlic sauce is better than sex !
My only knock is that there is not enough parsley in your falafel .
Whoever it was on the phone that took my order did not really know what he was doing .
The kid that delivered the pizza handed me the food and the receipt at the same time expecting me to sign the receipt with no hands ...
The restaurant was not busy and my table of four had all finished our drinks and appetizers and we still waited 10 minutes .
Not only will i never return but i will let everyone know not to bother .
Folks , do not settle for an office that makes you dread scheduling another visit .
I had to cancel several appointments with a previous office , because they were not able to see me anymore without a 2 month wait , before i could even predict my work schedule .
Do not settle for a doctor who makes you feel like they are just getting you out of the way so they can move on to their next appointment !
I have not gotten that impression from other offices ( particularly my last one ! ) .
Not sure what happened to this place over the years .
Customer service has gradually gone down and they no longer take phone orders for to go food .
There is not really another bar like this in the area .
Would not go anywhere else !
I do not know what the 1 star rating was about but that person must have been in a different office ( and on a different planet for that matter ) than i was in .
Not to mention their juice is amazing , by far my favorite !!!
The night before i could not sleep in any position and got a total of 3 hours of sleep .
Due to 3 hours of sleep , while i was filling out paperwork , i accidentally spilled my water on the floor and a woman ( i can not remember her name but i will update because she deserves the recognition ) at the front desk was the kindest person to someone who was running on low sleep and in so much pain .
She reassured me that i did not need to worry about the spill .
I will be back on thursday for another appointment and i already can not wait !!!
If it were not for the reviews i read , i have been under someone else 's care and not as satisfied as i am at this moment .
However , i did not have the best experience .
When i first arrived at the drive up , i was food was still being prepared - that 's fine ; i did not mind waiting a few minutes .
All of this to say , the food is not bad but i would not bet on your food being ready when you get there !
This place is the go to for my girlfriend and i. been here multiple times and have never had a complaint .
I do not exactly agree with the reviewer , who wrote , this is not only the best arab food in phoenix , but everywhere !
I can not speak for any of the meat dishes , but while the hummus and babaghanoush are very good , my partner and i are in disagreement as to how good .
You would think smoother would be better ... while it 's a matter of taste , i would argue it is not .
Not saying that 's the case for either ; but having tried canned hummus , i suspect , i am not wrong .
As far as those two dishes go , we rate them hands down better than haji baba ( though i think not by much ; my partner thinks they are significantly better ) .
Just as haji baba is not a " real " restaurant per se , this place is located inside the shopping center .
There is no separation -- except for a steel railing --- and as you eat , customers mill around the store .
It does not leave an impression or quiet , calm and privacy .
If ambiance is important to you , then this is most likely not the place to think about having a " real " meal .
It 's been years since i have written a review on yelp , probably because no business has blown me away quite like dee for dentist .
I had been going to my wife 's dentist since we started dating over four years ago , more so for convenience and because who thinks of a dental visit like planning for a meal ... are not they all alike ?
This being my first visit , i was led on a guided tour of the facility , which included me stepping into a stand up 3 - d x ray machine , which was not only awesome but proved to me that my recent septoplasty surgery with my ent doctor actually did open up my airways in my nose .
Doctor dee sat down and explained every little detail of each one of my teeth , much like a doctor would / should , but not one dentist has ever done that to the degree that you felt he / she truly cared about what 's going on with my dental health holistically .
Long story short ( probably , too late ) , i have never viewed my dental health as i do my general health .
They play movies while you are getting your teeth worked on and have put in enough thought to handing out sunglasses so that you are not blinded by the bright light they are shining into your mouth .
The only thing , they did not have the movie titles i requested , probably because they were not kid friendly .
Young staff had no idea how to desl w / it & kept running back to a manager that was trying to sort out a delivery problem .
Employee did not know how to work the phone .
I love the lamb kebob sandwich , can not wait to try some of the other ones like the shwarma and kefta .
The pies like interesting and worth a try when i am not rushing to get back to work .
The restaurant is more of a simple counter , no frills and limited menu , but rates an objective five stars based on food quality , value and service .
Not every arizonan 's cup of tea , perhaps , but for foodophiles and the culturally curious , definitely recommended .
Ok i was not going to leave a review but this is the cherry on top ... for a sports bar it 's awesome - they have a ton of tvs , food was great , service awesome , $ 5 bud light pitcher great deal .
It was a friday night and they did not seem that busy which really surprised us because the pizza was great .
We really wanted to bring back some pizza but had no way to keep it cold .
You also can not beat the cozy fireplace , free wifi and friendly staff .
The lighting in the bar area was a little bright , but not overpowering .
Unfortunately i can not say much good about the food i have had from sanfratello's .
Not sure if it was microwaved , but thought it was just hot and bland .
Not sure if it s a cheese i am not used to or of the sauce was different than what i like .
I will not say that it was not good ..
Just not for my taste .
I can not agree with the people who say that papa johns or pizza hut is better quality .. but the value for those places are for sure .. apples and oranges in this case .
I also do not agree with the reviewer that this is not a safe place because someone posted a photo in their review with a gun .
People conceal carry even more as you do not even need a permit here .
I also certainly do not agree with the other reviewer 's choice in flashing their gun around on a yelp review of a pizza parlor though either .
While all of these trends have some how made their way to the valley of the sun , there 's one thing that i have never been able to find here , garlic sauce like the one that 's served at the la institution zankou chicken .
For those who have never tried it either pack an overnight bag and head to la or drive down to 20th street and van buren to al - hana inside of baiz market , it s the closest thing to zankou chicken in phoenix and its close location makes it even better .
While the offerings might seem typical the flavors are bold and should not be missed .
The creamy roasted eggplant dip babaghannuj ( $ 4.49 ) had a smokiness usually not found in many other places .
After a wonderful meal you 'd think there would not be enough room left for desert , but my rule is there 's always room .
While i love la , knowing that i do not have to drive 300 miles to get my garlic sauce fix makes the drive across town all the tastier .
I have never ate the food here but , i have gotten coffee here a few times .
Although , they have some good mochas ... i do not think it 's worth the price at all .
When i checked in today i could not believe i have not done a review of this place yet !
I do not give very many 5 stars reviews because i really have to have my socks knocked for that !
You do not usually have to wait but if you do go next door and get a glass of wine or a beer , they will even come over and get you when they are ready .
We were not disappointed .
( the pies , on the other hand , were not particularly good , so stick with the tenderloin sandwiches . )
No idea how anyone could give them less than 5 stars !?
The front desk ladies were really sweet and i did not have to wait any more than a couple minutes to get in to see the doc .
I have been seeing a chiropractor on and off for the last 10 years and it was not until i went to see dr .
Normally after seeing a chiro , i still feel some pain and have to do a lot of stretching when i get home but not with dr cady .
I do not think you will be able to find any place better .
I already love this place and i have not even been here yet .
I have not been to the dentist in a few years and i have insurance through a step parent so i was a little confused on the process .
I only had my medical insurance provider and was confused as to why she was not funding my dental insurance .
I do not know what lengths she went through to find this out or how she magically did it but i was so appreciative i even told her i loved her .
She did not even have to do this and could have just had me figure it out on my own but she found this all out for me and i am so happy to have made an appointment there .
I hope no one takes david 's review down the page seriously ..
I have been going here for 3 years now and will never go anywhere else !!!
If you are looking for a dentist do not hesitate to go here , i am so glad i did !
I do not do reviews for 2 or 3 stars , but am making an exception here , because it 's so complicated .
I have never seen an owner / manager behave the way this lady did .
If you own or manage a restaurant , it would be worth sending your new managers here as part of their training to simply observe what not to do as a manager .
It 's a shame the night shift does not give a damn .
Everything else is either prepped too fast for the wait staff , then dries out under heat lamps , or it was half assed and it shows they do not pickup where the daily prep left off . " not sure we will come back even though we had good experiences before this .

I am not averse to this style of shawerma but given the reviews i was expecting to be blown away and i was not .
Were it not for the appetizers i would have probably given this place at least three stars .
I do not have a problem with canned grape leaves but at least be honest as to their origins before making me pay top dollar for them .
If you like a good salty ( not too much though ) pizza made from fresh hand tossed dough this is the place to be !
They use a special cheese blend you will not get anywhere else .
High price for a salad and then i tipped her well not realizing how much it was .
I will not be back .
I threw out most of my order tonight ( pizza and chicken parm ) , it just was not for me .
Nice separate sitting area ( looked like a nice doctor 's office ) , not the row of chairs against the window that most places have .
You could tell she really cared and did not rush through it .
But i told the owner ( nice guy , but can not remember his name ) i did not want any drilling and very natural looking thin nails , so he suggested this technique .
Not the generic stuff in an unidentified bottle .
Cons : not an abundance of parking spaces available .
Color selection of normal polish and powder dips was not the best i have seen .
I can not speak for gels since i did not get this .
No similar colors grouped together .
There was no organization at all and a lot of bottles were even 2 rows deep .
It made it very difficult to find a color ( so maybe they have more colors than i previously described , but i just could not find them !
I do not know , that would have been nice , but when the receptionist told me to pick a color , she directed me to the wall and not anything else , so i am not sure ... with the powder dip , my nails were dipped into the same jar the color came in .
If you do not know what this is , i am probably confusing you right now .
I am not sure how sanitary it is to have everyone that gets this technique done to continue to dip their nails into the same jar .
It seems to me it would be better to pour a little bit of the powder into a separate bowl and disregard the unused portion , so as not to cross contaminate .
But again , i have never had this done before , and am not exactly up - to - date on my study of how hand germs spread , so take it for what it s worth .
There is always a line up to get ice cream here , and it 's no wonder why !
Their goal is to make it so they do not have to see you next thursday .
Even though the meat was dipped in au hi and i had a 30 minute drive home , it was still perfect and not soggy at all !
Man i can not get enough of them little treats !
It 's just bread , but that does not quite describe it correctly , with cheese melted on top , so simple but yet so dang good !
Does not look like much on the outside , but he place is adorable .
It has a bunch of tables with waiter service and then has some couches with a double fireplace where you can catch up with friends and just have coffee if you are not looking for anything sit - down .
The waitress was super friendly and came by often to refill coffee or make sure we did not need anything else .
She kept interrupting conversation to talk to us about the baby or her childbirth experience .... we do not want to hear that during our meal .
I can def do that ... she did not charge us for any of our coffee which was nice ) , and the service was good .
I did not get the girls name that made my juice but she is awesome she gave me exactly what i asked for .
Everyone including scott were super nice the young man at the counter was dealing with a difficult older customer and he handled it very well better then what i would have done i am going to tell everyone i know about how great you guys are keep up the good work and please do not change customer service is huge to me and you guys rank at the top
The service was great , no complaints there and the place was nice and clean .
I am not shocked by the price of the food .
Other consumers should not be shocked either .
You are not getting a soggy , greasy pizza .
It 's not fast food !!
This is the kind of place that arizona does not have much of .
I was not very pleased with them whatsoever .
I am not sure .
I should not have to repeat my name ( spelling and all ) , phone number , and order multiple times .
So i found this place on yelp and i was excited by everything and i was not let down .
Now , i knew coming in that i needed some work to be done , so it did not come to the least surprise that dee dee was disappointed in what she saw .
She did not pressure me into anything and told me what ever sequence i want to do things , they will do it .
Sausage patty covered the inside pieces of the pizza but the outer pieces not so much .
We were disappointed and will not be going back .
I have gone a few times now before writing a review to look for consistency in excellence and i found it at tip toe nails - they did not disappoint !
No one is as clean and sterile as tip toe !
However , my gel manicure did not last two weeks ( more like it started looking old after one week ) and my feet looked untouched after a couple of days .
Food is good and not just your typical bar food .
I have been toying with the idea of quitting since my 30th birthday , but have not been able to pull it off .
The first thing i noticed was that this is not your normal " smoke " shop ( or " vape " shop , as it were ) : nice , fluffy leather couches , aromas of exotic fruits , and lots of friendly people socializing .
They even have a cigarette flavored one , which was very exciting for me because i do not really like all the tooti fruiti ones ... just plain tobacco .
If you are trying to quit smoking , but can not seem to , this may be the option for you .
Do not take my word for it though .
Can not wait to come back .
I came in an hour before close and although some staff were cleaning , i did not feel rushed to get my froyo and get out .
I have been to all the popular salons in town & no one else compares to the quality of service and respect you get from michael .
All his hard work over the years has finally paid off & i could not be happier for him !
I will never go anywhere else !
Not alot of bars have them .
I was stoked and could not wait to find the time to get my nails done ( it 's usually a 2 - hour + event ; my schedule only permits me to designate one afternoon a month to get them done ) .
Overall , i am pleased enough with my hands : the shape is nice , they have a pretty thin , natural appearance for acrylics and even throughout but i did not notice until i got home : * drilled my natural nails paper thin .
I do gel under acrylic for convenience since it 's more durable ( i travel often and carrying luggage can easily break natural nails ) ; however , underneath are my natural nails , which are strong and grow out -- i do not have tips .
I did not like that michael drilled through my natural nails underneath so they are basically uneven and paper thin .
They do not do : silk wrap ( which does not require drilling your nail bed to promote adhesion ) or dipped gel ( which does not require uv or led light ) or monochromatic colored chrome ( the latest nail trend ) and do limited designs ( see below ) -- limited chrome .
Not wanting to give up on my rose gold nails , i asked him whether he intended to offer them in the foreseeable future .
I also do not do much design here either ( given my clientele ) . "
( he did not know that ) i am a corporate transactional attorney .
I do not tolerate passive aggressive broad strokes of inaccurate stereotyped generalizations .
We quickly realized they do not have indoor seating so we made the best out of sitting out on the patio .
I was then promptly left alone for my entire visit , and not helped again until i made my purchase at the register .
I understand that many people simply want to be left alone to look around in a store and not hassled by employees .
Any one of the employees had every opportunity to check in on me , but did not .
I understand that i could have gone up to any of them and asked a question , but they seemed so involved in their own conversations , it did not feel very comfortable .
I was not informed of any specials , deals or discounts , and when i tried to check the facebook page for a discount , the guy informed me that because it was not their own ejuice that i could not use a discount anyway .
He did not really offer me any options or try to engage me to try and see if there was something else i might be more interested in .
He could have at least informed me that because the discounts do not work on this juice , i might want to try some more of their own mixes to get a better deal .
I am happy with my vape , and that 's fine , but if that 's the level of service i can expect at puff vapors , i might not be inclined to go back .
I have been to al hana many times now but never checked in before today ( glad i remembered this time ! ) .
Since i got there at 2:30 pm starving with still , no breakfast i decided to order 2 sandwiches .
To me , the sandwich was very good , not excellent though coz it lacked more seasoning .
I have not only tried many chicken shawarmas in dubai and lebanon before but because i also tried their chicken shawarma before and for some reason it tasted better .
The yogurt is delicious , the toppings are incredible , the owners are very friendly - i can not say enough good things about it !
If you have never been before , try the oatmeal cookie flavor - it is amazing .
This is not your run - of - the - mill frozen yogurt .
They tend to be busier on these days , so sometimes the lines can get long , but i do not think i have ever waited more than 10 minutes to get completely through the line and to the cashier .
At 9 am on a busy sunday morning , in march in arizona ( it does not get any more prime time than that ! ) .
Apparently this task can not be done at a slower time when people will not be inconvenienced .
So there we are , trapped in this tiny little waiting area , in everyone 's way , and we can not move - she is not stopping her cleaning to let us in .
2 ) before putting our names on the list , i ask this same snotty hostess / owner " how long is the wait ? " and she replies , " do not worry , the tables turn fast , it will not be long " .
I ask a second time , she says again , " not long " .
She will not tell me how long !
If they are making so much money that they do not have to treat customers properly , then good for them .
They need me more than i need them , and i will not give my hard - earned money to a business that acts as if i am doing them a favor by showing up .
I will never set foot in this place again , and i will tell as many people as i can about my experience .
Aside from the lack of response in those few weeks , it could not have been handled better .
Crunch berries , carmel apple code red mountain dew and they taste like they should try them all i will never go anywhere else !!!!
I am sure our visit would have been pleasant had we not sat waiting for our food for so long that rigor mortis was setting in .
I think because the server did not want to come to our table anymore .
Not the iowa café i remember .
Do not get me wrong , there are some great spots out here for middle eastern grub , but it 's nothing like it is back in chi .
I can not recommend these guys highly enough .
If you do not love your current dentist , go here .
I can not say enough good things about this clinic !
When i first we nt here , they were up front and clear about what my insurance covered and did not cover and outlined any possible costs etc.
Do not pass this place up !
They looked great when he finished but as he painted them , he made comments about not doing designs because his clientele is high end and high end people do not like designs ( another reviewer posted that he made similar comments to her , as well ) .
When looking at other reviews on here , i can not help but notice that whenever there is a negative review , the business owner replies with a passive aggressive ( or even directly aggressive ) public message where the initial reviewer is either insulted and / or accused of being dishonest .
Despite the customer service i received , i will not be going here again for the simple fact that i think all people should be treated well .
Nice to see owners who are not cutting corners .
Every time i come , i never really get greeted , if i do it 's a simple hello , with no eye contact .
I do not get offered samples either .
Other than that , it 's an okay yogurt shop , it 's clean , but not spotless like everyone says .
Another thing i do not like it that their toppings are pilled high .
Wow 30 mins for a pie thine crust is undercook 23.50 for large pie brooklyn vs across the street 10 x better just plain old ok pizza def not worth the money
The service is outstanding and always on point -- i have never been without someone offering a sample every time i stop in .
They always seem like they only have one person running the store -- and that 's not fair to that person at all .
Never gave up on me !
The prescriptions are never called in from the staff .
I had to leave several messages and finally an on call doctor mentioned he did not know why the strips had not been ordered like he had requested a week ago .
I do not know if the actual ice cream had any marshmallows in it .
Not a very strong flavor .
I am giving this place only a 3 because the burnt marshmallow did not really seem to have any marshmallows in it .
We can not say enough for them !
The staff are friendly and professional , the equipment is state of the art , and they offer bottled water , tea and coffee in the waiting room , not that i have ever had to wait long .
Now i know why , no matter what day of the week it is , there is a good crowd of people at / in this place .
I am a gelato fan , and hubby likes good quality ice cream - but yogurtology did not disappoint !
You can imagine how messy all of that could get , but not here .
Staff was cheery and friendly and not all stained up with the product ( like other popular places that serve ice cream ) .
Not too sweet and a great base for my topping choices of strawberries , bobas ( little gelatin - like balls of flavor ) , raspberry sauce and oreo cookie crumbles .
Hubby had salted caramel , cupcake batter , and red velvet cake , no toppings .
Even though i did not indulge ... it looked yum .
First - you get two scoops no matter what size you get and decent pricing , 10 $ for two , i got kiddie and he got regular .
I had never been to a chiropractor before going to ahwatukee spine and disc .
No complaints whatsoever for my first visit here .
I imagine that it can not be perfect every time but it was pretty close .
The vegetarians in our home ended up with sausage on the pizza not just one piece but many !...
The ravioli was just bad i can not think of a way to describe how bad it was ..
I would think maybe this should not be allowed to be delivered as it was so sub par ... the ham pizza was burnt and over cooked and the veggie pizza was under cooked and of course had meat on a veggie pizza .
I can not even think about giving this restaurant a second chance .
The girl who did my pedicure was so sweet and she definitely took her time and did not rush through .
The billing department does not seem to be adequate .
This place has a pretty good breakfast and that is what i am writing my review on because i have not tried their lunch .
Apparently they have really good pie too but i have not had that either .
Thin crust pizza was slightly above average , but not something i 'd go out of my way for or recommend .
I think that 's absurd , but if they can charge those prices then i can not fault them for doing so .
Taste was good but not great .
Service was ok ; no smile by anyone working there whatsoever ( and so went two days and served by different people ) .
If that 's the only place in phoenix , i would not mind going again but i would try some of the other places in the area before i return there .
Never complain when i come here !
For years their billing has been a mess and no one can seem to provide accurate information .
Giving them 5 stars - food is fine .. no complaints .
I do not plan on going anywhere else for my dental work .
I could not taste any flavors from the chickpeas , tahini , or spices .
Just that of an oil i could not even place it s origin .
Got into my car and could not wait to have a bite ...
I had asked the woman behind the counter two times what the dish was called , and she did not sound too confident in telling me that she knew it as " shmeer . "
The dessert i bought does not even come close to approaching the wow factor of this link 's image ... kanefe / knefeh .
For help with the pain and the worsening condition , to no prevail .
This dr. will give you the undivided attention that patients do not seem to get these days .
No wait times .
One of the few places that i do not need to write much about ...
I do not even smoke and i drive 45 min .
The only thing keeping this from a 5 , is the wait was longer than i would tolerate which is a result from a high demand for tables that they just do not have .
( i can not think of her name - younger girl , beautiful , long dark hair ) every time i have been there , she answers my silly , random questions , and tells me the truth .
These people always go above and beyond , and are not ever rude , condescending or make you feel unwelcome .
To their credit , they refunded it - but not before the manager acted as though he could not believe we did not think it was great .
I have had no issues and have been here many a times .
I gave it a 4 / 5 only because i ve been to many ice cream places in my time and when it comes to environment decor taste location etc overall it s not the best in the city but i would most definately come around time and time again becsuse it was great .
Also , try their mozzarella sticks which are fresh and never frozen .
Not only did she provide the type of service you would expect when you are out , she just seemed to go above and beyond !
Not only that , but our drink never got to the point of empty before we were asked what else we needed .
We can not really give an opinion about the food , because we only had a few drinks , but based off of the drinks , and the amazing service , rivals is definitely a place we will be stopping back everytime we are in the cleveland area !
No doubt !
Honestly , i do not think i have ever tasted such creamy yogurt in my life .
My husband 's corned beef sandwich had cheese and sauerkraut in it which was not listed on the menu .
We felt the wait staff was not just busy , they were quite lax .
The food was poor and the wait unbearable and not excusable or even understandable .
If so , why not prepare , have more staff and definitely get a new cook !
We will never go back .
Ed 's offers plenty of options in the fruit and nut category in ice cream and gelato , though not my first choice .
I do not enjoy .
I will never go anywhere else .
Polish on a pedi lasts 3 weeks or longer , and not a chip !
No lineup at all !
I had no idea at the time it was gelato , i just knew that it was the super rare flavour of my childhood and i wanted it .
Sadly i think the pistachio ice cream of my childhood is just no more .
I will not go back .
They do not sell newspapers .
I ask for one every time i go there .... they do not get the hint .
Also , i want real butter with my toast and they do not have it .
Plus i can not be without the namoura or zoolbia bamieh they have in their bakery for long .
I did not expect that i had to take off my crowns and restart the whole thing after i spent $ 3000 because of the root carnal treatment .
And what worse was my health insurance does not cover the re-treatment because it was out of 3 months window so i had to pay from my own pocket i hope in future dee can do better with whatever treatment she does , and what happened to me will never happen to anybody else
When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said " i would not want to sit in that seat after that . " instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents , she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident .
My wife and i took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama .
We are both educated professionals and also manage people for a living , after seeing so many infractions on this visit , it was determined that we will not be visiting this establishment ever again .
After reading other negative postings and one about their two year old child that had to sit on his father 's lap for breakfast due to lack of service , obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant .
He is very hands on and does not just get you in and send you on your way .
I have herniated disc and he helps manage the areas around the disc to help me be more comfortable and not be so stiff or tightness of muscles .
16 previous reviewers , averaging 4.5 stars , can not be wrong .
Two points ... ed is a very nice guy ( talk to him about ice cream if he 's not too busy ) , and he cares about his product .
Do not try to get a second server involved in your party ... it will just slow things down - and it will not work . ;-)
Menu looked really good but did not stay to eat more .
I can not tell you how incredible this place is .
Since i did not have insurance i was freaking out about the cost !
Not one time in my life have i ever gotten a phone call from a dentist office checking to see if i was doing alright .
I would never go to any other dentist .
Waking up in the morning and not feeling any pain at all is a new experience for me .
But then i thought i should probably venture out of the nut sack and experience different flavours - ones that i have never tried before .
Seeing as they did not have an extensive selection of gelato flavours , and seeing as i am a woman who likes variety , i wandered over to their ice cream section - now we are talkin' !
I opted for the burnt marshmallow ... and i never looked back !
Although it did not really encompass any hint of marshmallow flavour , it was the creamiest , smoothest , ice cream i have ever tasted .
The caramel was to die for and i do not usually like caramel ...
Do not change your mind on what kind of drink ( nonalcoholic ) you want after you get it .
My husband ordered an ice tea , he did not like it , when the waitress came bake he asked to change his drink to a soda .
That has never happened to us before .
He had one glass of ice tea and did not even finish it .
We just know no matter what stick with your first drink choice .
Had a few procedures done , no pain , no drama !
Most other items went up by $ 1 to $ 1.50 for that price the falafel is rather small and does not include any sides .
She was informative and did not rush us . .
They were not too bad .
I had defected items with name brand products in the past and scott replaced the item with no questions asked ( talk about customer service ) and provided an alternative item at the same time .
Pros : customer service , knowledge , fresh juice brewed in house , no feeling of being rushed to shop , friendly atmosphere , friendly staff , willing and able to accept suggestions , variety of juices , variety of mods and batteries .
I can not say enough about how amazing she is .
Not only does she do amazing adjustments she cares about causation and solving the problem !
I have physical therapy starting at this location tomorrow ( so convenient you can see multiple providers under one roof ) and i have no doubt i am in excellent hands and will be on the road to recovery soon !
I came here based on the yelp reviews and was not impressed .
It took me by surprise since after my last cleaning at a different dentist i did not need any work .
The dentist that had seen me popped in from a different room where she was doing a procedure , she seemed very rushed and it definitely was not a great first impression .
I am making an appointment elsewhere for a second opinion and can tell you i will not be coming back here .
They just opened their new bar / patio addition and it is really one of the nicest in the area , the bar is not on amain road , so the environment is really relaxing .
They have yet to get their audio and video systems installed , but they were not missed on this beautiful mother 's day .
I go at least once a week and i am not ashamed of this fact . :)
I did not think it was any worse or any better than other froyo places i have been to .
Apparently , i am the only one in phx who knows it because no one is carrying it this year .
Fresh herbs that i can not find elsewhere for only 89 cents !
The very , very nice employee did not just tell me what aisle , she walked me straight to it and when i commented about a ground version , she helped me search for that .
We do not often get such gems of ethnicity in phoenix , but this hidden treasure made me feel sooooooo good on a sick day .
I can not wait to go back and try the restaurant , buy more groceries and test my cooking skills , and get get my fix of the world abroad without having to buts out the bones for an international flight .
It 's never too loud or too crowded , something i really appreciate as i like to relax !
Although the parking is minimal , i have never had trouble .
Not that i would have ever asked , but you can not deny that kind of customer service !
Plus , they do not talk about you right in front of your face - a pet peeve of mine .
They have never once made me feel like a pain for changing my mind about what color i wanted after seeing it on my nail - a problem at a lot of salons .
Al hana has been given a bum rap because it is in what reportedly is a " bad neighborhood " there are no people wandering the streets .
For all the times there , i have never seen a police car .
It is not " bad " .
The prices are good , and you can get cuts you can not find anywhere else .
It lasts a long time and i do not have to worry about it chipping unless i do something silly like slam my nail in a drawer or something ! :/
Um , wow ! for $ 27 my wife and i ordered way too much delicious food and ate way to much of it because we just could not decide which incredible flavor to end on .
Sure . but it 's an immigrant neighborhood and the food is obviously targeting its market and not the white - washed american palate .
I got a regular pedi polish with a gel manicure - perfect match with no problem .
I am not sure i have ever been in a restaurant that serves them like this even though it 's one of the easiest recipes you could make .
I was too full for dessert but could not resist the temptation of pecan pie on the menu so i ordered a piece to take home .
It was not as good as my mother 's .
I wish they did not close so early since i am not a morning person but i do want to come back here someday when the opportunity presents itself .
I had to share my water with my daughter when they did not come back to refill hers .
You would have thought they would have been crazy busy mid day on mother 's day but the place was only half - full which made the lackluster service more surprising since they were not overloaded with customers , at least not when we were there .
I have gone a few times now before writing a review to look for consistency in excellence and i found it at tip toe nails - they did not disappoint !
I have seen just about everyone including ( but not limited to ) : dr. david stone , m.d. dr. angela j. christopher , dc , a.r.t , m.u.a.c. faktr dr . ryan rudd , dc , a.r.t. dr. michael cady , dc dr .
I chose this establishment because it had the best yelp reviews in the area closest to my house , and i have not been disappointed .
The quality providers , the multi-disciplinary approach to healing the whole body , and addressing the root of the problem ( not just treating symptoms ! )
They go above and beyond the call of duty to try to help you out ... the chiropractors here do far more than mere manual adjustments - they do manual therapy / muscle work / myofascial release techniques , they have spinal decompression machines , as well as all sorts of other modalities that the standard chiropractic practice does not offer .
The pt technologies here are also state of the art and most office do not have a cold probe or a treadmill that can be used in an aqueous environment .
The massage therapists here are also top notch ... very therapeutic and this is not your typical spa or massage envy like place where all they do is rub lotion on you .
My only request is that they switch out the no sugar added flavor a little more often .
If you are lucky enough to become a client of micheal 's , you will not regret it !
Had a decent but not huge selection on their lunch menu , including sandwiches , wraps , salads , as well as the daily lunch specials , which included a soup of the day , quesadilla of the day , and two quiches .
I was not there for breakfast , but the breakfast menu looked good , with choices listed including waffles , omelets , hot oatmeal , and eggs benedict .
Those toppings really can hike up the price here since they can be so heavy , they had varieties i have never seen in other shops .
This place does not have filtered water or even water from a tap .
So , do not forget to grab your drink and pay for it with your food .
I did not realize i could not get a cup of water when i ordered / paid for my food , so i ended up drinking a bottle of warm water in my car when i was done eating .
This restaurant is down a street i would never drive down .
Most people would probably never pass this store in their commute to any place in the valley .
As there are no pork products in this store ) grocery store .
You will not see the name " al - hana " on the outside when you drive up , so do not be confused .
The herbs and spices you find in whole foods for astronomical prices are not so expensive in there .
Their ad does not lie : upscale food for a fair price !
Did not feel like they were just would recommend them to my family and friends .
The ladies do as well as can be expected , but i have never seen owners or management here when things are hopping and they need help .
Not in this case .
I can not express how much i dislike going to the dentist .
I always get along with them , the pain is never unbearable , but i just do not like someone rooting around in my mouth .
I could not decide whether it sounded more like a haji baba or cafe istanbul type place .
There is no table service ; you order at the counter .
The menu consists of appetizers , salads , pies ( i may have to venture into this territory ; it 's something cafe istanbul and haji baba do not have ) , plates , and sandwiches .
I was disappointed to find that they do not have lamb tongue , and that they were out of soujouk and ma'anek .
I went with the lamb sandwich , which did not have the lamb in kabab form like you would expect , but rather as a ground - up kafta type of consistency .
The sandwiches were not huge , but i will say , that lamb was nicely flavored .
If it were not for our uncle ( from iowa ) wanting to try this place , we would likely never have come here .
Not a place to go if you are looking for healthy breakfast .
You are not gon na find healthy haha . " we ordered a cinnamon roll to share and it was very fresh and soft but the icing was too sweet .
Still have not found one better than a cinnabon .
The monstrosity was not complete without bacon gravy , home fries , toast , and eggs .
It was very grounded and not quite satisfying .
The blueberry pie was also good but not sure about the " award - winning " label .
Overall , this was a nice find with no wait on a weekend .
My friends food was served without the bread so we asked for the bread which was delivered when she basically finished her meal , no apology for that , never was our coffee or water refilled .
Tables were all getting seated and not getting any attention , people sitting and waiting as they keep seating and filling up the restaurant .
1 . having two waitresses on a busy sunday morning not a smart choice .
I used to waitress and i know it 's not easy but you know sunday 's get busy so have another server on .
Not sure if i will go back at this point honestly .
I have sampled : pumpkin - excellent ( who knew ? ) coffee toffee - very good ( coffee part is excellent , would prefer more , bigger chunks of toffee ) pralines and cream - it s ok .... but it s a delicate flavour and i am not a delicate eater , haha something no one has mentioned is that ed 's has clean washrooms available , this is key after being outside for a long walk on a hot day and wanting to attend to business and wash your hands before enjoying your ice cream .
I do not know if this would be considered " iowan " style .
I do not know if i would call it " iowa " style .
This review had an opportunity to not be very good , however in life things go wrong .... it 's what you do to correct a problem that tells me the most .
We ordered a couple of pizzas and were told delivery would take about 40 minutes ... an hour later no pizza .
I was a little short with her on the phone , let 's face it there are less expensive pizza options .... just not as authentic and tasty .
Other patrons came in , sat , water and drinks served and still no one came by .
I had coconut and sweetcream and i did not want it to end !
Heading there mid-afternoon on a weekend in the summer and you will see a line - up out the door , but early evening is usually not a problem .
This place does not have that taste at all .
Dentists are never my favorite appointments as i have the worst teeth my entire life .
My kids and i liked it , but my wife did not much care for it , so we probably will not go as a family very often .
It did not really ... we were just hungry .
To your front and left is the seating which does not have any kind of privacy .
So , do not waste your time trying to gps it - just gps baiz market !
Secondly , ambiance or quick service are probably not the reasons you 'd come to eat inside an outdated restaurant on styrofoam plates .
I did not get a chance to get my pizza !!
I called in an order and the teen taking the call did not give me a time .
No organization and people everywhere .
After 15 minutes waiting is a cluttered lobby and making no head way to the counter i decided to go outside and call .
I was very polite and did not let my frustration show .
However , we did not really like the kababs .
The place has not impressed me to come again .
Still have not eaten the food here but i wanted to give their mocha another try since i did not want starbucks or dunkin .
Not only is her staff amazing .
There are tons of yogurt shops nearby , but they do not compare to yogurtology .
I can not decide which one i like best .
Do not waste your time .
Upon my arrival at this restaurant the hostess / waitress / maid did not bother to greet me .
Do not actually expect any breakfast at 8 am .
I have never worked at a restaurant that let employees come drink on their day off because it alienates the other customers .
Incase you we are wondering , she did not say " yes , " but she did not say " no ! "
Not only that but they make their own juice and it is the best juice by far that i have ever tried .
They also have a great website with tons of flavors , amazing prices and fast shipping if your not local ..
If you have not checked them out yet , your missing out !
The food was not great , matter of fact it was a bit disappointing .
Do not be fooled by all the new trendy ice cream places popping up , ed 's is the real deal .
They get you back on or before your appointment time ( i have never had to wait ) .
I came in before 11 and they were not open yet but instead of turning me away they encouraged me to come in and order .
I am not getting all the rave reviews at all .
If you can not wait 30 minutes for an awesome , delicious pizza , walk your butt to little caesars !!
The pizza cheese was rubbery , the crust had no flavor with the texture of cardboard , the breadsticks looked like they were from olive garden but were dense and flavorless .
They get it just right , the creme brulee , not too sweet or heavy , refreshing and tasty .
Staff is friendly , and it 's not dirt cheap , but ice cream never really is anymore .
There was no artistic license taken with the food .
Do not come here looking for healthy options on the menu .
There are no egg - white omelets or low - carb wraps .
My breakfast really stuck to my ribs , though , and i did not get hungry again until almost dinner time .
Placed an online order , never received package even though tracking stated deliveried .
No response .
Emailed again , no response .
Have to now report to my credit card company , stay away from online ordering no customer service
No froyo place can compare !
I can not wait to come back here and try the thin crust .
Fresh ice cream , try their rotation of seasonal flavours , pumpkin , guinness , bacon , ( not sure what season bacon is , but let 's say they experiment ) .
Whichever you opt for , you will not be disappointed .
As a pilates teacher and certified rossiter practitioner , i work with lots of clients in pain - unfortunately this time it was for me and there are no other rossiter coaches in phoenix to help me !
He listened to me , explained his treatment plan , was gentle ( no " back cracking " ) and did not make me feel rushed .
They did not have it ready and as a result i got a late start on my appointment .
I have not been to many places , so i can not really compare yogurtology to the other local spots .
But it seems to move quickly and there 's never a long wait .
There is always a no sugar added selection , which is a plus .
I even witnessed another customer ask for something that was not out , and the employee went into the back room and brought out a cup of the topping for her .
While no one actually enjoys going to the dentist , i can honestly say i never have a bad experience coming here !
I never have to sit in the lobby or dental chair for hours to be seen either !
I will not see another dentist as long as i live in the las vegas area !
You never feel rushed .
No complaints with the quality of food .
They do not take orders in an orderly manner .
You just stand near the counter and eask the patrons " are you waiting to order or waiting for food " there is no line .
This place is overpriced , management is super unfriendly , not happy about the food either .
Takes forever to get recognized when you walk in and when you sit down you are not even greeted for another 15 minutes , and as a waitress myself , that makes me cringe .
Would not send friends this way .
Only to maybe grab a cup of coffee through the drive through so you do not have to go inside and actually receive the bad service .
From not scrubbing well enough .
I do not like to complain much so i did not say much .
Just because it did not worked out for me does not mean it will not work out for other customer .
The price are good prices not bad at all .
I am not sure about his name or if he is an owner but he asked me to leave because of the review and telling me he is not comfortable doing my full set based on what i said .
I though that was what a business and customer service was about . he failed to do that but he did explain well to me about a few things i did not know ( which i appreciate and understand .
I was raised well so of course i left with no fuss .
Maybe i was too black to be service and not worth fixing the problem .
I heard them talking about me with other customers ( not good customer service .. just rude ) it did not bother me but it was rude .
I heard them talking about me with other customers ( not good customer service .. just rude ) it did not bother me but it was rude .
I feel bad not giving them a higher rating but i did bump it up half a star .
The cheese was not stringy and elastic as i would have preferred .
I am glad i did not have to pay for it .
Maybe we just do not dig the chicago experience , not for us , sorry .
Great flavor good ingredients and not skimpy on toppings ...
We ordered an iced t , a milkshake and a cocktail so we were not surprised by the wait until it was literally 30 minutes later when we got them .
Still , no drinks .
I m getting super irritated at this point but tyler was really trying and the other server on was absolutely no help .
Very good and not too hot .
The bill for all that was 42 bucks so not bad on that , either .
Well it 's anyone that did not give ed 'd 5 stars !
We also had a pan pizza which my husband said was ok but again the sauce has no flavor and there was not enough cheese .
I think more fruit variety would be nice , but it 's not a big deal .
But , i do not have a super sweet tooth , so i ended up doing the tart flavor and added some fresh fruit on top .
For those who do not know south side of chicago means new york ( thin crust ) style pizza .
Chicago is known for deep pan pizza and this is disappointing that they can not carry on the tradition .
Sorry guys but unless things change i will not be back soon .
They had the midwest hospitality that no place out here has !
They will work on your builds if your not into diy , and they have supplies if you do like to build your own .
However i tasted their jagger juice that i could not decide weather i liked or not ( jagger ) so the dude gave me a free 10 ml bottle to sample more on my own .
I know we are in good hands , i will never trust anyone else with my or my family 's teeth .
It came out fairly quickly , was not too hot , ready to drink right away , and was okay - coulda been richer .
Al - hana was not bad , it just did not blow me away .
I can understand why some reviewers were not totally comfortable here , but i really do not think it 's a bad or dangerous area .
In my opinion , low income does not always equal ' hood .
It 's not an area that 's going to entice to explore on a leisurely walk , but i felt plenty safe walking there from mcdowell .
Best not to go close to closing .
No garnish , looked naked on the large plate all by itself .
The website 's hours are not correct .
Took tome to hear what was bothering me and i never felt rushed like you do with most health care facilities .
It is a hidden place you would never know about , but really is it worth knowing ?
My first surprise was the bread , it was not a pita , peta nor lafa it was some other form of thin flatbread .
The falafel was a bit too firm for me , and the flat bread was not my favorite but the salad part was good .
Nothing fancy , no designs , no acrylics , just a pedi with color .
Staff was not overly friendly but not rude .
I did not feel welcomed here .
The other times , i 'd catch him looking at me , but never a word , or even so much as a smile .
I could be wrong but it feels like they are going for a certain type of clientele here and based on appearances alone , i am not it .
That said , if that 's what they are going for , they may want to go to ballantyne or south park and not plaza midwood which is one of if not the most friendly , open , diverse and welcoming neighborhood in charlotte .
And there was not nearly enough of it on the pasta .
I tried one of their pizzas but was not too thrilled with it .
I will never go back again !
Do not waste your time and money there are other restaurants with better quality food !
Now it 's as though no one works there when i go in .
Last time i was in was around 6 pm on a thursday so it was fairly busy and the cashier kim was too busy in the back to help with samples ( obviously they have to serve them and it 's not add serve for samples ) and this kim woman only came out to ring me up say my total and rush to the back .
I was in panic mode and called the emergency line on a sunday afternoon , i left a message and 30 minutes later i was called back and reassured i would be fine and they would get me in asap to fix it , but unfortunately i was out of town and could not rush home .
I could not be more thankful to have found them a few years ago .
I have gone a few times now before writing a review to look for consistency in excellence and i found it at tip toe nails - they did not disappoint !
No one is as clean and sterile as tip toe !
After a thorough physical evaluation he informed me of a procedure that i have never heard of from any of the spine doctors i have seen and i was really excited .
He gave me hope that i will eventually , quite possibly not have to live with the pain and discomfort that i have to endure on a regular basis .
Everyone was friendly and helpful and i can not wait to see what the future holds for physical well being thanks to dr. komar .
I never really know what to make of perk - cup cafe .
In fairness , i have only been there ( albeit on a number of different occasions ) for breakfast on a saturday or sunday , and i have never opted for the brunch buffet , electing rather to order off their menu .
It 's not horrible mind you , but it 's not anything to write home about either .
I have never actually eaten any of there bakery items , and they all look really good , but i wonder how long a quarter of a cake could have been sitting there when i come in on a saturday or sunday morning .
But again , in fairness , i have never actually tried anything from their bakery so i may be way off .
Really would like to keep it a secret , but i will not !
Oh , seriously though , anyone who is a friend of mine knows i do not mind eating in a market in a neighborhood bordered by the projects .
I do not care .
Maybe next time i will try to get there about 17 seconds earlier so i will not inconvenience you .
Shwarma , hummus , kebab , kafta , etc. it does not matter , everything is all made from scratch , and when you order it , is amazingly delicious .
It still looks like a tired and shabby arby 's , all scuffed up and untidy and frankly not very clean .
But , on the down side , the quality of what you get for a really low price is not so good , so my rating there is 1 1 / 2 .
My wife had a different pie , and she ate it so fast i did not have a chance to sample it so i can not tell you what it was .
Kristen was incredible though , she used the gentlest technique and the gentlest approach and took a lot of time with my mouth to really get my teeth clean and we did not have to use novocain .
My only gripe , the reason i did not give them five stars , i was not offered a beverage of any kind .
Not cool tiptoe .
For the price we were not expecting a sauce that taste like preservatives and a can tomato soup flavor .
We also ordered hot wings and they had no real kick for a hot wing and they were soggy .
Took time off of work , showed up 30 minutes early , filled out the new patient forms and was then told that i could not use my insurance for the chiropractor .
Since the chiropractor was not in my insurance 's network , they wanted me to pay $ 100 ( my normal copay is $ 35 ) .
1 . they accepted my insurance 2 . i would see the chiropractor on the first visit if they knew that i was going to see the chiropractor , they should have also known that the chiropractor would not be covered by my insurance .
I am not quite sure if this " mistake " is just plain incompetence or actually unethical business practice .
Either way , i do not think i will be returning to this facility .
I can not speak to the efficacy of the treatment staff , but i can say that i do not trust the administrative department ( the people that will communicate with my insurance and actually facilitate my financial ability to receive treatment ) .
I showed up for my appointment and explained that i was not able to get their forms to download on my computer .
Her response was that there was not time to fill out forms before the appointment so that even though i had called the day before and expressed that i was in some pain that i would not be able to keep my appointment .
He had no response one way or the other .
There was no offer to reschedule just that i could not be seen .
I will not be back .... with or without paperwork .
I do not really like custard flavors so i flavors like pina colada , baja blast , and bombsicle .
So it 's this little eatery tucked inside a market , no frills .
I can not wait to try more things here and eagerly await my next visit !
When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said " i would not want to sit in that seat after that . " instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents , she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident .
My wife and i took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama .
We are both educated professionals and also manage people for a living , after seeing so many infractions on this visit , it was determined that we will not be visiting this establishment ever again .
After reading other negative posting about their two year old kids obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant .
I was expecting a relaxing and quality experience , but this was not what i received .
The lady doing my nails seemed to have never done nails before .
She ended up only painting the top of my nails , not getting any of the sides .
One more coat did not fix my nails as they were still not painted all the way .
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
This bar does not look like much outside but the inside is very nice not to mention spacious .
I like to try new pizza places and usually just about everything i order is pretty tasty .. however , when i made my online order with sanfratello's , the order was pretty accurate except for not getting the extra sauce i paid for .. my order was a large ham and pinapple thin crust pizza , a caesar salad and fried zucchini ...... the salad was fresh enough but not at all cold and the zucchini and pizza , honestly tasted like it was more than a day old and reheated ... i also was given a free desert if my order amount came to $ 30 or more .. the desert was sugar fritz with chocolate sause , also tasted very old .... very disappointed and will not be ordering from this restaurant again ...

Oatmeal cookie however is a constant flavor that i can not get enough of .
They do not sell them , but will make them for you .
It has not been a full week and my nails are starting to separate , my middle finger popped up and my nail is green .
I have been getting my nails done since i was a kid and have never had my nails have any issue .
I am really disappointed as i liked this place a lot , but i can not have my nails changing color .
So , i am not usually a sports bar person , however , this place makes me appreciate the concept .
It 's not .
It 's not the typical bar food ; wraps and sandwiches of exotic bent , salads , burgers and appetizers designed to make the tasebuds dance , the place is a real treat .
In my mind , this place has no rivals , but do not take my word for it , decide for yourself ; )
The ambiance is not homey , wide open & 2 much like a cafeteria .
We started with the fried mushrooms , they were good but not memorable .

After reading other negative posting about their two year old kids obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant .
I want to rate this place higher , but can not bring myself to do it .
I really like the bar , the big screens , good beer selection ( but no pbr ) , very clean .
Bar owners may say it does not take away from business , but iot does .
Did not leave much of tip ( i am one of those people who tip based on service , not obligation or guilt ) .
She 's great at giving breaks when needed and makes a not so great thing like getting a cleaning not so bad .
I have had no issues and have been here many a times .
Started working with dr vincente for chiro when christopher is not there and he is amazing as well !
Do not let the name fool you , this is so much more than a coffee house !
Again , not coffee house selections by any stretch of the imagination .
Not just green beans with almonds on them , but actually prepared like a fine dining restaurant would with toasted almonds and sautéed beans .
3 * = sure , why not , 2 * = it 's better than starving , 1 * = a hungry homeless person , after one bite , would not eat this , even if you gave it to them for free .
( although you should still offer it to them ) no stars = ptomaine tillie 's foodborne pathogen diner .
The more i thought about it , the more i felt this could not be right .
He said he saw absolutely no decay .
Another thing i like is when you are near finishing your meal you can ask for a refill of you coffee to go , which they will gladly do at no extra charge .
Not the best i have ever had ( that was at a street market in amsterdam ) , but it was still much better than most .
I do not know if they always do it this way , but this was my experience .
It was pretty cheap , so i guess i can not complain too much .
When i go back i will definately be getting the pistachio , it had little chunks in it and was not too sweet highlighting the nutty flavour .
They have a lot of different varieties you will not find at a normal ice cream shop , it 's a great option for these hot summer days !!
Do not like .
Will not go back .
Sizes are kids , regular and large but no matter what size you choose you can have 2 different flavors .
My waffle cone did not taste super fresh but i love that they put a marshmallow in the bottom so your ice cream / gelato does not run down and out of the cone as it melts .
I can not say enough good things about their staff and juice !
But since i had my first bite of toasted marshmallow from greg 's ice cream ( only the distillery location ) i found ers to be a bit too sweet and i was not able to finish it .
Can not say enough good things about this team !
We stop in 2 - 3 times a month for dinner and we are never disappointed .
All in all you can not go wrong at rivals !
This is not the case at this cafe !!!!
Why would you own an eating establishment if you were not a people person ?
Does not make sense at all .
The polish lasted for a while , but unfortunately i dented it the same night i got them done but did not want to drive all the way over to plaza to get it fixed .
I do not know what 's on their menu cause they never gave us a menu .
I was happy to see others going up for a third plateful , since i never got close to shoving $ 12.99 worth of bacon into my mouth , at least someone was getting my money 's worth .
Usually get really good service not sure what we got today .
Kids behind the counter talking about a transaction not being completed and how the register was going to be short .
Finished the transaction and was not offered a receipt .
They screwed up our name on the wait list , wait time was not what we were told , excessive wait time to place order , had to ask for ordered drinks 2 times , excessive wait time for food ( 25 mins ) , then it took another 20 - 25 mins to pay the bill .
Breakfast was good , but not worth all the screw ups and no apologies !
Micheal is by far the best at what he does , i have been following him for 9 years and no one but him will ever touch my nails .
I am from chicago but never heard of this pizza place .
Not sure why some people gave it bad reviews .
You will not be disappointed .
Expensive and it did not taste any better than a frozen pizza .
( if you have not had one , try one asap ! )
Never fails us !
She has some really cool technology / equipment that i have never seen at a dental office before - makes going to the the dentist kinda cool .
I love pita and hummus , and the do offer this at al - hana , however do not forget where you are , at a grocery store .
I recommend brining a bottle of water as there is no fountain for drinks here .
The last time i went in i was not feeling too well and could not eat much of the buffet and my server only charged me for a kids meal .
Even when it 's busy it never feels too crowded .
The only negative thing i have to say about this place is the customer service has always been very slow no matter how busy it had been .
Food was not awful , but atmosphere and basics lacking .
I know there were a bunch of customers in there , but just saying hello and giving me a drip tip cover and not explaining what to do is not cool at all .
Thankfully the other guy , can not remember his name was really helpful , sat with me and gave suggestions and helped me the whole time changed my first impression around .
My hips were rotated making one leg longer which i kind of already knew but did not thing it was playing a role !
Christopher and her team of super awesome people i have no doubt that i will be up and about in no time .
Also , i feel like i should mention this ; i am not a paid commercial spokesmen . :)
They even boast a drive - through , which does not yet seem to be open .
Although touting to be a breakfast stop , perk cup cafe by no means is a grab - and - go place .
The service is relatively slow , although not impolite .
Due to its recent opening , lunch time is not very busy during the weekdays .
Perk cup does not seem to offer any niche or specialty items when it comes to food .
I have to say i have never experience such an amazing and caring staff .
If you are not white , mostly middle age , or have kids , they can be a little rude , rarely smile , and act like they hate their lives for serving you a scoop !
And the manager does not listen to any kind of complain - that 's if he 's there .
You can not ask for much more than that .
If you live in green valley or henderson , you 'd be a fool not to go to dee for dentist .
As most reviewers have already pointed out , al hana , located in the baiz market , is not in the best of neighborhoods but the food , the prices and service with a smile will have you coming back for more .
We ordered tabouli , hummus , shisk taook a falafel plate and 2 bottles of water ( sorry , no cocktails here ) .
We will absolutely come back not only for the food but also for the vast selection of middle eastern and international foods sold at baiz market .
My boss loved the meat and cheese pies , the hummus was nice , not too thick like pre-made hummus , and the babaghannouj was blended to perfection .
Unfortunately , yelp does not allow for zero star ratings .
Since this is a place i have not been to in chicago or phoenix , i wanted to look at the menu on line .
However , that was not the case .
Each time i tried , i got " this page could not be displayed " .
Just imagine you call a restaurant to place an order and you receive a voice mail message that " the mailbox is full and can not receive new messages . " being originally from the south side of chicago where this restaurant is from , i take personal affront to any restaurant being from my home city and providing subpar customer service .
There was no pain and the doctor made the procedures fun and entertaining .
When i have asked 2 different cashiers when it was coming back ( the sign on the cash register put up in january says their system is backed up and they need to restore it ) i was told they did not know .
I am not sure how other items on the menu are , but if they are anything like breakfast , they are going to taste great !
If you are looking for a truly unique and high quality pizza , i recommend trekking out to gilbert , i can not wait to eat through the whole menu .
If you have never had it before , get a can of uludag portakal from the cooler .
After a bad car accident , the place i was going to before was not helping me get better .
The iowa cafe is not amazing , but it 's a decent choice for breakfast in northeast mesa .
I am not a huge breakfast fan in general , but i do enjoy their biscuits and gravy .
During the winter it 's packed with snowbirds - but what is not in this neighborhood ?- and wait times can be lengthy .
A little pricey and lately their system has been down so the loyalty program is not working ... somewhat annoying .
I ate there bison burger yesterday and it was the nastiest burger i have ever had well not eat there again
The new location is a much nicer place but in no way makes up for the food .
It is just not the same food at all .
Acting that excited to see a customer is just a little too much and does not feel sincere anyway .
The woman started and i could tell she was struggling ( i had to ask her multiple times to fix the white tip ) so i asked her to remove this polish and just paint one solid color , i did not want to continue telling her how to do her job .
And received no cuticle oil .
I expressed how i felt to the receptionist ( not becky ) and she showed no sympathy .
Overall , i might try again due to the previous times but i am definitely not happy with my service .
And at this moment would not recommend .
Nothing special , not worth paying $ 8 for it .
Three small slices of bacon - on the plus side , they were not very greasy .
Two eggs over easy - eggs were well done , but they are just eggs ... did not appreciate the french toast and the eggs on the same plate , since it just made the egg yolk run over to the french toast , ketchup mixed with maple syrup , etc.
I can not comprehend how 2 dishes of 2 eggs , bacon , french toast , and a chicken salad wrap could have taken that long ...
Should still have not taken that long .
We did not get checked on once during our meal , except for like 1 minute after we got the food , before we even started eating , the waitress came by to ask us how we liked the food .
Lol he walked and talked me through every step and he explained the steps i did not understand , and when he explained them he did not make me feel as if i was dumb or less than .
If you are looking for a massage where you lay there and go to sleep he is not your guy .
I can not say enough about how he 's helped improve my quality of life !
Each and every kind of ice cream and gelato matches its description to a tee , tastes like it sounds , no wimpy weak flavours at ed's .
One more that i can not include in my favourites just yet but must be mentioned is - maple bacon , i kid you not , it s real .
Ed's has great hours so after dinner in leslieville you can take a leisurely stroll and wind up at ed 's on a no fail dessert excursion .
We had the chicken shawarma and ben had something with spiced beef in it ... the name lasted on my tongue about as long as the food , can not remember it , so sorry .
She then doubled down on her lie by immediately ordering me not to chew on that side of my mouth , then proceeded to work on me over the next 3 months , while continually telling me to not chew on that side of my mouth .
Just not a big fan of the product because i was burning a lot of my coils up fast .
I did the organic pedi , and i could not have been more pleased .
I opted for a simple polish , no complaints there , i felt like they had a good selection to choose from .
I have never had the privilege of using one before and it is fantastic !
I have never been so comfortable while getting fillings .
I am rarely disappointed when i come here , you know it 's good when you can not decide on a flavour .
There are plenty of times i go to other places and i can not pick a flavour for the opposite reason , because they all suck hahah honestly , i do not care too much about toppings and bottomings but if i did this place would be the best at it !
So many options , i do not think you 'd want for anything .
So it 's all about yogurt flavours for me and whether it tastes like yogurt or not , because i 'd rather it did not , there are some that do but it 's not overwhelming .
Oh and it does not hurt the wallet , join their loyalty program and save even more !
This question started my impromptu tour of cool places i did not know existed in phoenix .
Al - hana is located within baiz market - if you did not know that , you would probably never find it .
I could have spent way longer lingering in the aisles - they have items that i have not seen elsewhere , and at very reasonable prices .
So i m just leaving this place and not only did both of my garlic cheesebread have wax paxer stuck to them but the pizza was also all over the top of the box .
I cracked a tooth over the weekend and despite having no appointment i was seen within an hour .
When i asked if insurance covered it i was told no and do not worry i can get in right then and there because they sell it in office ( how convenient ) .
I went to the dentist and this so called " oral rinse " that is not covered by insurance .... it is !
I could not believe it .
This company is here to swindle and con you into thinking you need products that are in office and not covered by insurance .
They will harass you until no end through any means possible about coming in for your " next appoint " even when you yell them you have found another dentist .
Take my word , shop around , and do not fall for it .
However , the service was horrible and no one really seemed to care .
That 's my only complaint , i just do not love that area of town , or the drunk townies who smell like bonfires .
My husband and i moved here from michigan 5 years ago , the middle eastern food in mi can not be beat !
I spent almost 4 years searching for a good middle eastern restaurant but it seemed every restaurant i found around the phoenix area was persian style which i personally do not like .
Other randomness : they randomly take to - go orders when the manager is not upset that someone did a no show on a previous to - go order .
I no longer vape and i have not for a few months now but decided to leave a review because of the service and quality of juice that this place provides .
My personal favorite was the bomb pop but i have never have had a juice from puff that i did not like and have easily walked out of there with more than half of them .
No salads , no delivery ...
Service is not always the friendliest , but the food quality forgives this .
I love finding little gems hidden .. and can not wait to try her famous pies .. will have to come for lunch or dinner .. thank you
I was looking forward to some good middle eastern food when i went to al - hana and did not have a good experience .
Maybe the food used to be better , but it was not good when i we nt .
I ordered the chicken shawerma , and it was not good at all .
It was over salted and was not seasoned well at all ( lot 's of cury ) .
I did not come here for the ambiance , and this in no way is reflective of my review , as i almost exclusively review on food quality and service standards .
Witnessing this did nothing to help my experience ; but again , this is just what i experienced and not a reason for my rating of this restaurant .
However , currently i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
My husband and i have been on & off again customers over the years and have never had any major complaints about the wait times , food or service levels .
Well , with much disappointment i must say , our experience was sub-par at best , which is not at all what we were expecting .
We had a vet appointment for our dog at 1:45 pm , it was now 1:05 pm , not able to wait any longer and seeing no signs of our food , watching table after table receiving theirs , we finally flagged down our waitress and said , " we never received our food , we have been waiting 45 mins ! " the waitress looked shocked ( however , keep in mind she was filling our coffee cups the whole time and serving others around us whom she helped after us ) .. the waitress did do the right thing , she comped our coffees and did not charge us for the food we never received .

We will not be back .
So let me premise this post by saying that i have never received such a high quality of genuine customer care from a nail salon before .
( i have very thin , weak , short nails and the kind of work i do definitely does not help . )
He kindly offered several options to fix my broken nail ( a problem that i created / was my fault not theirs ) and told me that i could come on to get it fixed that same morning !
If you are looking for the best place to get your nails done , where the staff actually cares and really takes care of you - look no farther and book an appointment at tiptoe salon !
You will not be disappointed !
Maybe the girl / hostess did not intentionally try to give me and attitude , but i feel like there 's a certain way to greet and speak to people when they enter a restaurant .
He took an uber from tempe to this location ; i told him he would not be sorry .
So when i arrived , the hostess / waitress with a good sized tattoo on her arm did not really greet me .
I saw a few empty tables and wondered if i should have sat myself down , but i really did not want to disregard the " please wait to be seated " sign .
She continued to assist customers that we already seated and i really did not mind waiting .
I just wished she would have said " please wait a minute " or " i will seat you in just a second . " then i would not be left waiting or disappointed ( i hate being brushed off ) .
She went back behind the counter and then walked out and rudely walked across in front of me with no " excuse me . "
Then , i did not pay it no mind .
She took down our beverages ( including my second beverage ) and order , we chatted for a good while until we both noticed that we never received our beverages .
We would have flagged her down but she never came around our area until she brought our meals , including our missing beverages .
It 's not too big of a deal .
We just noticed that we never got our beverages while we waited .
He did not experience the rudeness upon my arrival , which is good because , he 'd probably would never want to return if he got there before me .
Do not just walk off and ignore , but at the same time expect us people to catch on .
We do not run the place .
Food is great , lots of variety and never disappointed .
Close enough to enjoy , but far enough from my house so that i do not eat this everyday !
She had not been before , but i suspect she will be going back !
It was a wonderful , relaxing experience , and the polish was expertly - done , which i can not say of most of the pedicures i have had .
Did not have the time to sample any of the in - house juices , but i will be back !
Great customer service cheese pie was so good ate with hummus and do not forget the salad so good i did not share
He takes his time to make sure my pain is addressed thoroughly ; there is never a rush .
I can not recommend him more highly !
He did not force a prescription on me and send me on my way .
Do not get me wrong - the food is great and one of the best breakfast / brunch / lunch spots in berea .
Have never had a bad meal here and probably never will .
There was a party going on in the back room , but our waitress did not notify us of this fact until she came back 35 minutes after we ordered to apologize for slow service because of the party .
A party should not slow service down to that extreme , and if it does the owners should reevaluate how the kitchen runs because obviously something is amiss .
I really do love the food here and that 's why i was very upset when my mother and i had but no choice to leave without food today because the service was so poor .
Overall , if you order take - out you do not wait nearly as long for the food , so if in the area and you want to experience the fantastic breakfast offered by perk - cup , i suggest ordering it to - go to save yourself the service headache .
Most dentists usually destroy my mouth and make my gums feel like they have just gone though a blender ; however , dr. meevasin is one who does not fit this description .
She is very gentle on the gums when she cleans , at first my gums bled from my poor brushing , but she referred me to use a sonicare and now i never bleed from my cleanings anymore .
Honestly , i have never seen a dental office that actually takes the initiative to clean each mug every customer drinks out of .
The inside of this establishment is not any better so disregard any hackneyed phrases -- " do not judge a book by it 's cover " -- for now .
There is a lite smell reminiscing one of there grandparents cold , dark , musty cellar ; and do not expect a warm greeting like the one received from former - convicts at the entrance way of fry 's .
Everything we ate -- shafta , shwarma , hummus with a grip of pita , 1 large cheese pie , 1 small meat pie , a can of pineapple soda ( with really sugar ) and a can of grape soda ( also not corn syrup ) -- totaled to only $ 17.46 .
So word to the wise , let go , try it , wolf - down a shafta or shwarma pita burrito ( for only $ 4.99 each ) because haste does not lack taste .
They were not in a rush to make a sale and they genuinely want the customer to be satisfied and to become regulars .
We went here 15 minutes before closing when alot of businesses are not really wanting you to walk in but the employees greeted us and asked if we needed to taste anything to just let them know .
Me and hubby finally got a free day to ourselves so why not watch the indians / yankees ( go nyy ) game at a local sports bar right ?
The wings were very fatty and had a lot of extra bone on them , not as much meat as i had hopes for .
The ale battered onion rings came out in a literal vat of grease and no dipping sauce , i was kind of turned off by how truly greasy they were .
They are nicely done with full color pics of most dishes so no more guessing and no need for an interrupter !
They have added rice to most of their dishes at no extra charge .
If you are not a yogurt fan , the sorbet is awesome !
These guys are so good that i do not want to eat ben & jerry 's anymore .
Took the time to not only do a full exam but also talk to me and listen to my concerns .
You will not regret it and will have a new primary care provider that you can count on .
You will not be disappointed !!
Growing up i was not fortunate enough to go to regular dental checkups .
I have had to have several work done and not once have i had a bad experience !
I have been witness to conversations between her and her assistants and it 's obvious that not only is she a fantastic doctor with incredible knowledge of dentistry and a passion for it , but she 's quite a woman !!
I got it and after playing with it at home i did not like it .
So then i we nt back to puff and explained to him why i did not like it .
If you are a wing lover , you can not go wrong here .
As i have previously been told many times , ' do not you ever get tired of hummus ? ' , and apparently the answer is ' no '. even though i had leftover hummus from switch from the night before , i was not to be deterred from trying a new source relatively close to home ( especially since pita jungle does not seem to want to open up in my lifetime , although the rumor is any day now ) .

Sure enough at lunchtime , the place was not too crowded , but did do a solid and steady business .
Of course , the crux of the story was to also get some hummus , which she mentioned did not come with the sandwich , so i 'd have to order separately .
No prob , mate , it s all good , so of course , let 's get a small side .
Not a bad place , but i do nt consider it a " great sports bar " .
Not much taste with it .
That was when the piles of vibrant gelato we found at the store window first made an impression that we could not shake throughout our meal .
We both found the waffle cones a little too crunchy ( we did not know that this was possible either ! ) , but the delicious ice cream is definitely enough to make us want to come back again and again .
I can not wait !
I will not be coming back to this place .
Outdoor patio is really cool , although you can not actually see the tv screens due to the glare .
I have not at all been satisfied with their food .
The boneless wings were ok , but that 's not really hard , is it ?
Well , you would not think a burger or nachos would be hard to get right either .
Sorry , but tortilla chips half way covered with cheese , a mound of olives and peppers , topped with a hamburger patty broken into large chunks ( and yes , also tasted like lighter fluid ) does not count as " loaded nachos " to me .
So , we may go back ... i do not know .
The crowd gets pretty intoxicated and belligerent not ok to scream f# ( ( , ass ..... , etc etc so the whole restaurant / bar can hear .
I will be back , no question .
I like a crust that does not overpower the toppings but i think maybe they kneeded it too much .
We loved the favor but because the crust was thin ( yes we ordered the deep dish ) we did not really have left overs .
Not much .
I have had the corned beef hash and 2 eggs twice now and while it has not been anything that jumps out and screams " come back for more " it still has not stopped me from clearing my plate each time .
The first time my eggs were a little overdone but not horrible and they were just fine the second .
I have been to this place a few times to satisfy my yogurt cravings since yogurtland is not around where i live .
When i tried the yogurt , i did not taste the tangy sweetness of the tart that i was expecting .
You order at the counter and the girl who took our order repeated some special instructions , but they were either not written down for the kitchen or the cook just ignored them .
After waiting for the food , we just decided to pick out what we did not like rather than return the item .
There 's more than the one near the counter , so look around if you do not see what you like .
Yes , it 's not your typical trendy location and there 's a lot of poverty around , but that can be said for a lot of neighborhoods in the phoenix metro area .
I guess if you are not up for an eating adventure , there 's got to be an olive garden holding a booth in your name !
Little no frills cafe integrated with a small international market .
Could be better with the addition of some side dishes but for those who want a small light inexpensive hot lunch this is not a bad little gem .
But not completely packed .
11 minutes may not sound long , but that 's completely unacceptable in the restaurant business .
We will never be back there again .
Their liquids are awesome and they do not add alcohol !
The girl at the counter was kind of grouchy and did not seem like she wanted to be there , otherwise this place would be five stars .
The flafil was decent , the flat bread is not my favorite but for 2.99 it s a good filling meal .
Even better than my grandmas ( but i did not tell you that ) .
It was my first visit and i had not heard or read anything about it .
To my disappointment , the pizza tasted ok but it was not great .
Not for the price .
It was no better than papa john 's , certainly not as good as barros , but 30 - 40 % more expensive .
However , the owners ( ? ) unexpectedly brought out some sort of bread w / chocolate and powdered sugar for my kids , at no cost .
I originally purchased a clone from puff vapors , and attempted to have it built at some other vape shops due to puff not having the specific atomizer i was looking for .
I am pretty set on my vaping supplies , but when the time comes i will not consider giving my business to anyone else .
Unless your over 60 do not go , waited to be seated , people got seated in front of us .
When we got the bill it was someone else 's bill , finally got ours and it still did not seem right .
Will not be back .
Since i have never had acupuncture done to me before , i was unsure of what to expect .
Jody conducted an examination on me prior to treatment using a neat little device that gave a detailed report on areas of my body that were not functioning at optimal levels and highlighted issues that i had not even told her about yet .
After the treatment , for the first time in i could not tell you how long , i actually felt like my feet and lower body were connected to the ground and " on " .
I learned a ton of what my body was not doing and the compensations that i had created to make up for weak and non functioning parts of my body .
Being an avid lifter , i thought that i had pretty good control of my body , but apparently not so much ( thanks dr. whipple ) .
It is always busy or almost full but because the service is good people move in and out and we have never had a problem getting a table .
The line does not move the quickest but they take your order all in one group and let you sample a few flavours .
- milkshake ( $ 6.50 double ) - m went with a strawberry s amore milkshake as he has not had one in ages .
I was a little nervous because i had read all the reviews and the one thing everyone kept saying was they could not get their own samples and that when it 's busy nobody is available to help .
Maybe we came at a good time but we had no problem with this .
She was super friendly and not rushed , even though i do think she was alone .
You do not have to go far in middleburgh or parma to find a sports bar , but there are only a few who choose to take pride in their food - and when it comes to pub fare , rivals sports grille is ironically in a league of their own ..
Upon our arrival at rivals , i surprisingly reveled in the atmostphere - tv 's in every corner with a wood burning fireplace in plain view - i knew this was not your average buffalo wing joint .
Overall , you can tell this restaurant put a lot of thought and effort into their menu and image , which give this place a touch of class not often found at the neighborhood sports bar .
We are working on strengthening so that i can become strong and out of pain , no other chiropractor has ever done this !
No judging , no pushing .
Boooo to not letting me get my own samples .
I will not be returning .
( like me , mike is a techhead . ) furthermore , this is one dental office that does not have any promotional advertising littering the walls , a common and unwanted aspect of so many dental practices these days .
I have not visited their location yet but i have tried frosted dew , bomb pop and a few others , they sell it at the silverton hotel and casino .
I normally do not take a chance on liquids without trying it but i was out late and needed a fill .
Been here a lot recently and the past couple times we went multiple machines were not working .
It looked as though they had never been washed .
Also , i have never seen a yogurt place that does not offer swirl options of the two flavors in the machines !
There is not any other place i think i could eat an entire order of hummus by myself ....
The slightly higher cost per ounce than some other places is offset by their " loyalty card " which gives you back $ 3 after eight purchases , so the cost is not a biggie ..... and ....... you will be back , i am sure .
I still go there because the food is good and it 's close to work , but it 's not as automatic a choice as it once was .
Did not look up to glance around at her other tables .
Did not refill coffee .
When i brought it to the servers attention , she told me that was how they make them , that their pancakes are dense , not fluffy .
Perk- cup cafe does not have contaminated tea water , but they hit on my other hot tea nerve .
We were sort of in the neighborhood of al - hana , ( ok , not really , but close enough ) and it won out over some of the other suggestions ... and i am glad it did :) we all like discovering new places and this little spot takes some discovering : ) if you do not know that it 's inside baiz market , you will never discover al - hana ... and that would be a shame : ) much like the cafe at ranch market ( just up the street ) this little cafe is a genuine delight embedded in this small grocery market ( with , apparently , no end of interesting food items and sundries in its aisles : ) one of the more interesting things i noted , during our visit , was the sizable inventory of hookah's , under lock and key , in the front of the store : ) they must have 50 of these things in stock !
I am not a hookah marketing expert , but if asked about inventory management of hookah 's , i would have said " hold on there , earl , i think 3 or 4 hookah 's in stock is plenty " :-) so , imagine my surprise and delight , when , during a one hour lunch , i saw 2 of these water pipes walk out the door , accompanied by all sorts of tobacco cans , and other paraphenalia : ) and , these hookah 's are not cheap ... sticker price looks to be around $ 200 for the low end models ( i really can not tell high end from low end , with hookah 's ... i am just going with size as the differentiator : -)
It 's a stark contrast to the places that think it 's enough to just take your order and toss your food at you ... the nice people that took care of me just did not stop smiling the entire time i was there ... and i did not even have spinach in my teeth ... this time : ) half - way between roosevelt and van buren on 20th st .
After dining at iowa cafe for over 20 + years i , along with my extended family & friends , will no longer frequent this establishment .
The current employees are destroying the image of the cafe which in turn results in loyal clientele no longer wanting to dine there again .
By 11:35 still no food .
Why did not a waitress come to our table during this whole time and check on us ?
It was not as if the 2 waitresses were busy by all means .
When she came back in from smoking and touching the front entrance door handle she never washed her hands .
I am sure that money never made it to the cash register .
This confirmed to me that this was no longer the iowa cafe that my entire family would gather to for special lunches over the years .
One with my father that he never got to eat and the other with my mother where it took over an hour to have lunch with being the only table there .
I can no longer recommend this restaurant .
I am always taken care of from the moment i step in the door until the moment i am stepping out great polish choices , best price for a great gel mani every time ( no appointment ) , no wait during the day and these are just a few reasons why i definitely recommend tiptoe the staff is great and treats you like family from the first appointment .
Yogurtogy also has a wide variety of toppings and even has baklava which i have never seen as a topping before .
I am so sorry , but i could not give this place more than 1 star .
I noticed every time i called and spoke to ( i do not want to mention the name ) x , she always seemed eager to help and was very , very nice , but she never called me back even though she told me she would call me back " either way . "
So i hung out with the tech for awhile , but i did not feel he was helping me like i needed him to and he just was not very friendly .
The clerk , is busy , scattered and just can not handle answering any questions .
I have heard that a few times by now and i stated i am not sure what that means since i was not given any recommendations or any type of real treatment plan .
Mind you , my workmans comp has not been situated , so i am paying for all of this out of my pocket , so i have to be pretty careful and know exactly how much this is going to cost me so i can determine how many times a week i can go .
I asked her how many times a week is recommended for me to come and she said " did not she tell you ? "
I said no , she did not tell me anything .
I never saw the physical therapist again since she handed me off to the tech .
I did not even have a treatment plan .
So , after talking to this frazzled , too busy to really help me and answer questions , i ran out of time and had another appointment to get to , so i never did find out how many times a week i needed to come in .
Maybe some of the staff are not very motivated .
It did cost me $ 100 , out of my own pocket and i am not really sure what it was i paid for .
I work in healthcare and i could not imagine just dumping a patient on a tech and never talking to them again .
I have actually never had an experience like this before from a medical provider .
I have been going to dr.christopher for the past few weeks and could not be happier .
If your in the area do yourself a favor and stop in for dinner and if your not in the area totally worth the trip .
The not so good ~ their aguas frescas are not made fresh to order and tasted very watered down .
It was playing some kind of mexican comedy that was not appropriate for the children to watch that were dinning at the time .
I was charged for 2 more beers than i thought i drank but i was in no shape to argue so no stars deducted for that .
Very contemporary and the space is small but does not feel cramped .
The rolls ' names do not matter because the key here is none of the fish tasted fresh .
Also our server would have been notified but she did not seem interested .
Overall , i 'd never recommend sushi here .
Did not have any of the entrees , but if the sushi is an indication of the pride in their work , i 'd rather not .
I probably will not return .
It does not look like much from the outside but it 's definitely a good place to try .
Not a lot of small italian places to go eat in charlotte so this one fills the spot nicely .
Not a usual place for the typical vegas visitor , but it 's not hard to find .
Never been to a waffle house until today and i am impressed .
I was about to order to go but there was no need as my all star meal was cooked in less than 5 minutes and delicious .
Philly is pretty good too but not as good as portofinos philly .
I buy the entertainment coupon book every year and use it to buy the same torta paquime combo i like but today they would not accept it .
Do not advertise in a coupon book who 's coupons your not going to accept !
Tables were dirty and service was not great like the location on 43rd ave .
So the woman came to wipe it .. did not say anything to us .
She stormed off not uttering a word .
Never seen a fight or anything .
I do not think i have ever been to an authentic mexican joint that is so updated .
I can not remember everything we ordered ( uhh , we were in vegas ! ) , but i know i enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and the beef tenderloin and blue cheese .
No different than if mcdonalds charged $ 4 for ketchup to go with the fries .
Can not wait to try pizza and subs next time !
First time will not be the last !
Unfortunately it just ended up being this gargantuan salty deal that just did not really bring anything to the table besides lots of salt .
Maybe i was there on an off day but i was not impressed .
In my entire life i have never seen wings this small .
Never have i been victim to such awful customer service in my entire life .
This place could have had a customer for life with my wife and i , now i can guarantee i will never step foot in the house of pizza ever again .
Food : the food was not actually bad for buffet .
The seafood seemed fresh enough ( there 's no really fresh seafood in charlotte being that i am from the dmv - land of blue crabs ) .
The american items i did not try because who wants asian - ized american food ( i do not ) , so i mainly stuck to the seafood and hibachi .
I am not too keen on wasting food .
I would go back for lunch , when it 's cheaper , but you can not beat that broad of a food menu @ that low of a price .
Great concept in a great location , that being said there is a ton of room for improvement , the fence is not very tall and there are a lot of areas that there is a bench pushed up to the fence making it very easy for any dog to escape .
They allow any dog in no questions asked .
No place will ever be perfect for everyone but with some attention to detail most of the negative reviews could be corrected with very little effort .
- you have to try the almond and banana ice cream desserts .... and i do not care how full you are cuz they cost almost nothing and are damn good !
Now , not everything is awesome but with the hibachi and sushi bars , you can not go wrong .
Quality of food in no way matches the over priced menu .
Not kid friendly .
Never eating here again .
The portions are not huge , but it was really yummy .
I am not sure how the pizza is , but it looked amazing from what i saw .
We are italian and from ny so compared to home they were small and not as good , but i will give them effort for trying !
On the weekend you can find sashimi if you are lucky - i never saw any sashimi during the lunch on a weekday .
That is a bit too intense for most people but my real point is that this place does not beat rusan 's when it comes to sushi , but rusan 's has no sashimi offered on the buffet .
1 ) inconsistency of quality of the food ; 2 ) inconsistency of availability of the food ; if you want to eat a lot of food and are not picky then this place is fine , but you probably just want the absolute cheapest place to go .
I never tried the pizza and i never intend to .
It was not persian flavor it tasted more like arab 's or turkish kabab .
It seriously looks like they have not changed in thing in 20 years .
The crust is a little on the thick side , but not as thick as a pan pizza .
No one drank more than five sips .
It 's not like we all had different orders .
Now , the wait would have been acceptable if it was not for point 3 that i will discuss next .
As this is not a sushi restaurant by definition , they offer traditional seating and a a traditional chinese and japanese menu by default .
If you sit in the regular dining room , you will not receive exactly the same service as you would sitting at the sushi bar .
This is not a fault in the restaurant .
If you sit in the regular area , the service has no way of knowing in advance what you will be ordering , and so they only treat you like a sushi customer in the sushi area .
However , you do not have to order sushi when you sit at the sushi bar .
You will find the specialty rolls on the back page of the menu , apart from the other offerings , under the futomaki heading , and be sure to check the specials board as there are always one or two special creations that are not on the menu .
Regardless of which rolls you order , you will find that hunan sushi is high - quality , fresh , hand - rolled , and does not smell like fish .
I think it speaks highly of the restaurant when they can not only get a kid to eat such food , but to continue trying new things every time we go .
They do not , however , offer a children 's menu or child sized portions on either the sushi or the regular menu , so order accordingly ... sushi may be fish , rice , and veggies , but it is surprisingly filling , especially for younger diners .
However , since it does not take long to pepare and does not get cold , you can order one roll and then order another later if you are still hungry .
Smaller portions , not as good , and higher priced than firefly .
Not only do they have a great variety of asian food they also have a great location .
It is a great quality and not too expensive .
Basically you can not go wrong with hunan .
Come here if you want to wait & never get your order .
That said it 's not an in your face type of place , quite the opposite .
Not every dude wants to be seen going in to get a wax ( i used to care ) and you could just pop in here and out and no one would ever be the wiser .
Although none of the staff were rude , they also did not appear to be having a good day and partially projected that towards the customers .
Food is decent but not the greatest .
I just do not like the small portions of food u get with the tortas and combo plates .
To be honest , the broth was pretty salty and the wonton did not have much flavor .
The best ways to describe the teriyaki chicken dish was that it was bland and did not have much seasoning .
I was not impressed with the fried rice , it tasted like just plain old cooked brown rice . overall , we had a pleasant experience at house of hunan .
By the end of the work week i am done with cooking and i often do not want to leave my house ... pizza is nearly always our friday go - to dinner .
I enjoy hawthornes , but my husband does not ... he enjoys dominoes , but i do not .
It does not look all that great in all honesty but it tastes pretty darn good .
They do not skimp on cheese ( though sauce is lacking a bit ) .. so it works for us .
Now this is not the best pizza in the world but it certainly is not the worst .
A pie will set you back like $ 11 for cheese so you can not beat the price .
The entire parking lot was a mess and people were parked behind cars not in spots .
I parked next to a dozen other cars ( of note , there were no marked " spots " ) all of which were facing the train tracks and not blocking anyone .
There were no international towing signs .
When we left , my car was no longer there ...
There was still no international towing sign / symbol .
We called the towing company and they said our car was " too close to the track " which is ironic because there was no sign saying anything about being towed or about the train tracks and the distance you needed to be .
We went into the bar and told the bartender , she said " oh no ! yeah you can not see any spots they just come in and tow everyone , that sucks " .
The cars that were illegally parked behind people and not in " spots " were not towed because i recognized the same cars backed up behind one another not in spots . )
I am very frustrated with the dog bars response as well , if they often tow people for being too close to the tracks there should absolutely be a sign a few areas has a cement block but much of the area where people were parking did not .
We were not closer than other cars to the track .
Needless to say , even though we relocated to noda we will be driving the extra 15 minutes to lucky dog bark & brew , where they have clearly marked parking spots and they do not tow .
On top of that the facility is amazing and does not have old soiled astroturf .
I highly recommend skipping this place for not only the parking inconvenience since they tow for unclear reason but also the place is a dump .
I will never return and will make sure to warn people about this place .
Not worth it .
Though they do not sell food , there are so many restaurants around you can grab a bite and bring it back .
The parking is not the best but honestly i do not mind it one bit .
I just can not get myself to order anything but the cheese steak .
They have great drink specials and no cover on thursdays .
Nothing wrong with it , just not great .
There 's no way they are using real maple syrup ( or it 's been really watered down ) .
I really do not get it .
Will never come back .
Oh ya and no large crowds so i could enjoy my food in peace without a long wait to get my order !
I especially liked leaving the restaurant not overly full .
As this is a chain , i was not quite sure what to expect , but was really impressed .
Unfortunately i can not contribute to the positive reviews this place has .
I admit i am not a sushi eater so if that is what you are looking for then you should read other reviews .
While ca rolls is not the most flavorful dish ( the avocado mutes them ) these had no flavor and all you could taste was the seaweed wrap .
For a buzzer a last name is not sufficient .
The young lady who then lead us to our table did not speak one word !
After seating us and still not speaking she basically shoved the menus 6 inches from our faces and walked away .
Not to mention the cook did not core the pineapple .
The only reason i am giving two stars is because the service was not bad .
I have personally never had a complaint .
It 's a couple of marginally talented musicians on generally the same keyboard concept , but there are other musicians as well ( a drummer and guitarist ) , but no one can sing particularly well , none of them had much charisma and rather than keeping the energy going with singalongs that everyone knew ( think piano man ) they launched into songs that nearly no one could understand because of the volume of the music and after a couple of songs they would take a little break and do a dance like something from coyote ugly - even the bartenders and servers .
So you can not even get a drink to take away the pain .
And it is not that i have anything against bachelorette parties .
Do not mind the area friends .
The place was not packed from ordering to finally getting out food was exactly a hour .
Our waitress was not the most happy person either .
Well , really , my gf has been telling me how great they are " after a night of partying " ... and we do not party all that much so saturday night , after a long night we decided to go with our neighbor , and it must have been about 3 am ( technically sunday ) .
So we finally get there and we go ahead and have a seat because there is no sign telling us to wait to be seated .
There are no menus and the only table available is dirty with dishes left over from the last patrons .
I am told " the other locations are not like that " .
It hit the spot and they do not pretend that you are invisible .
And if i could give this waffle house no stars i would .
The woman that did my nails was distracted , the pedicure was messy ( my nails looked dirty when they were done ) and the whole experience was not at all what i expected given my positive experience with the other treatments .
I like it , girl does not :)
I have no issues here and have visited this location many many times and will continue to return .
I had to wait 15 minutes before someone even saw me inside the store and they were not even busy !
I usually get the same coffee and today it was just not very good ...
I am a big fan of tortas , however , and could not resist temptation .
No lettuce .
The bulk of the taste is the mayo / crema , which was so overpowering that i could not finish my meal .
Morningstar chicken and delicious new mexican salsa could not save the sandwich unfortunately .
I will not be going back to try it .
Need to get some more bar tenders but otherwise no complaints .
We had a fairly new waitress i am not gon na name her name because she was super sweet and fabulous ... she did not have the rhythm down yet but it 's understandable .
It did not come out correctly but i said no worries just bring me out some white sauce and i will pour it on there and mix it it 's fine ...
I have never gotten my salad so i just asked her to put it in a to go box which she did ... my sisters food was incorrect also ... she was new so we did not make a big deal of it .
Definitely regret not sending our food back when it was time to get my check i noticed that they charged me $ 2.50 for the white sauce that was supposed to be on my pasta .
Not a problem i showed her and she said she was going to have it taken off .
She never brought back an itemized ticket but she told me she took the offending i am off and that would be the only time they would do that because you can not substitute sauce ...
I asked her for an itemized receipt and they could not produce one .
The problem is on my sisters receipt they had charged her for the sides of sauce i personally think that they did not take the white sauce off and also added the dollar for a side of meat sauce that my sister got ...
I hope they get all the stuff worked out because if it happens again i will definitely not continue my patronage .
It might not seem like much but three or four dollars for me might be the difference between me having lunch one day or not ... i have to juggle money around when i go out and get something to eat .
I sure hope this does not happen again .
I had heard about the ppave , but did not realize it was around the corner .
It 's not necessarily bad , but there was the smell of dog pee out in the patio area .
It 's what you 'd expect being in zone full of dogs , but a human would not mind for it to be cleaner .
It 's definitely an experience and if you do not have a dog , but want one ...
Well at full price that did not amount to what it wldve been w the discount so i called customer service and they gave me 3 free drinks .
She said he was not ringing it up as dark roast which is why price did not change .
Today she scanned my card and nope , the price did not change .
After waiting about 5 minutes she said w an attitude that the system is down and it probably did not charge your card anyway .
When we finally got their attention the server was rude and stated with attitude and annoyance as to why we did not say anything when clearly we were waiting on being served while multiple servers just stared at our empty counter without once offering anything not even to double check if we had already been helped .
I do not remember the last time i went to a chinese buffet but it 's been years .
I just could not not find much of anything to my liking .
I will admit , there were some items that were just mediocre , the rest were just felt loaded with msg and generally not appetizing .
Even my kid would not eat it .
When i think of asian cuisine , i normally do not think of medina ohio , but dang house of hunan on the square makes me think otherwise .
Folks were nice ... there was only an occassional humping .... and no fights broke out ... so all and all a good time was had by all .
The inside was very cold .... it always seems to be that way .... and i am not quite sure , but the bartender was nice and has a good selection of beers to choose from in the bar .
I have been going to evolve for almost 5 years and have never had a negative experience .
Sounds bad ... it 's not that sort of massage spa .
What i mean is that she can work specific muscle groups and destroy tension and tightness like no ones business .
She spent 90 minutes on my upper body and left no stone unturned .
The music may not get started until about 7:30i sh.
Howl serves no food , but allows you to bring outside food in .
The paella is not as good as the tapas .
I have never really have to wait for a seat ...
First time i came i thought " that 's not enough food " oh , yes it is ... more than enough and at a fair price ...
I have made this my new breakfast spot no matter what time of the day it is ... you should come check them out if you are in the area !!
We decided to check it out even though we did not have our puppy with us .
Can not wait to go back , this time with my dog .
You can not leave without getting some of their cheap and tasty pan dulces either .
I would not get the elotes here though -- you can get much better elsewhere ( the one letdown here ) .
No one makes sure your dog has shots , there s pee puddles and poop is just sprayed away with a hose , possibly onto my feet .. i m not sure any employees were present , because other than the friendly bartender , no one is identified as staff .

The facial itself was pretty much everything i want from a facial but do not always get - an attentive esthetician ( in this case , the lovely keri ) who gives a lengthy décolleté massage as well as a hand and arm massage while the mask sets ( too many times in the past my technician has cleaned her tools while the mask set or even straight up left the room for ten minutes ) .
Huge bonus - not a single product was pushed on me .
Not going to make this long .
So for those who do not like to wait for something good , please do not come back and that way the rest up us will get sat faster . ;)
If you have not ever been to a waffle house you should try it .
The waffles are mandatory and it does not hurt to try a side of scrambled cheesy eggs .
Jen had a omelet and i think not weighed about five pounds .
He 's never been to a waffle house before and he was a little nervous about going in .
When he went into the bathroom i placed a bet with her that she could not get him to put it on .
Donuts are eh ... pink box donuts are much better ... but those places do not usually have drive - thrus .
I love trying out places i have not been befire , and i must say this place is a bit unique .
I have not seen that at other buffets .
Not a big deal for me , other than the thumb twirling , but this was not a good first impression .
No biggie ... it 's not like i need to reset the enya to get my relax on ... but the masseuse tried to keep massaging while messing with her phone .
That did not happen .
Security guy was pushing me ... i told him to do not act like that and he called other guys who pushed me away to the entrance sence i told them i brother to live then move for security ... place has no respect
Jennifer is not friendly at all .
Also do not order anything from the lunch side of the menu stick to the eggs
The waxing was efficient and not painful .
All are great my favorite is the agua de fruta the large drink is 2.70 and is worth every drop ask for no ice and get more :- ) .
While i do speak spanish i did hear a lady having the hardest time ordering in english until i stepped in to help no big deal but i think they could have handled situation better .
There was no way i was eating this !
The seafood mixture was not fresh .
Cristie did not ask how my lunch was and was non-plussed by the un- eaten grey lobster tail on my plate .
I will not return .
Their tapas were good , kinda reminded me of firefly , but it 's not that noisy here .
I am not sure what this soup was called but it was a corn cream based style , and was literally one of the best soups i have ever tasted .
I do not write many reviews on yelp as much as i use it for a resource , but this place i did because i really enjoy it .
I can not speak for any other items on the menu other then the tortas , soups , and the mango fresca so take this review based on those .
The flavor was good , but the wrappers were a little stiff and , most disappointingly , they did not include any hoisin sauce !
The lunch special is a good value , and the restaurant smells amazing , but the pizza was not my favorite .
We were a rather large party , so i understood why our wait time was a little long , but our waitress gave us drinks once and then was never seen again .
It was so disgusting , not to mention she is lucky she did not break a tooth .
We could not even bring ourselves to finish the meal we had ordered .
The hostess ( white male ) simple said " oh yeah , the cooks clean the woks after every order with a stainless steel brush and that happens sometimes . " not so much as even an apology .
I was not expecting anything out of this ordeal other than an apology and making sure it does not happen to some other poor person who may actually break their tooth ... ok so bad to the sushi that i ordered today ... by far the worst sushi i have ever eaten ( and come on it 's a freaking avocado and california roll , how hard is that to mess up ?!?! )
I just moved back from columbus where i are sushi all of the time and they never charged for this and i always had amazing sushi which was also not as pricey . ) then they jammed a bunch of nasty pickled ginger in the to go container so the entire row that was next to it tastes like disgusting pickled ginger .
I do not think i can bring myself to spend another dollar there again .
No thanks !
Not a place for a lot of dancing ( very small dance floor that never gets real lively ) , but a great place to listen to music .
The spicy tuna is not the tuna steak with sauce as i prefer but more the purée .
If your not a dog lover do not go it s that simple .
The selection was amazing and no matter the style of food i chose it was all fresh and delicious .
The egg drop soup was thick and looked like the egg yolk had not cooked in it .... i swear i hope no one gets sick eating raw eggs .
The egg drop soup was thick and looked like the egg yolk had not cooked in it .... i swear i hope no one gets sick eating raw eggs .
My wife and i could not even eat the lamb and it we nt straight to the trash .
My wife was so mad we did not even complain and left to eat somewhere else .
Not recommended at all .
Fatal , i had another perspective about buffets , grease meats , old and raw fishes ... and it was not sushi .. and if we talk about the sushi no taste at all .. i decided to go this place cause was close to my hotel , but definitively i should effort myself better looking for a place to eat ... now i understand why is so cheap !!!!

Never again ( go to a buffet restaurant )
Not a montreal restaurant experience , but value for money and a break from your montreal food quest .
When i booked the appointment the receptionist was confused as to how groupon worked and could not imagine how i booked two massages through one groupon voucher .
The massage did last the full hour but did not impress .
Lacked imagination , a lot of warm towels were applied , and i booked a full body massage which did not happen .
Overall , i will not be returning to this facility .
I can not complain about the quality of the food , the service , the atmosphere or the prices .
This way you do not burn your tongue on the first bite , ruining the rest of your meal .
Crunchy and light - really , no grease at all .
These guys did not even think about falling apart either .
The veggies were cooked well , not overdone and the pork , chicken and steak were very tender .
I was not sure if she would seat me or if i sat myself ( never visited a waffle house before ) after an awkward silence she said " ok " and walked off .
So i am already not liking it .
I never got close to trying the food .
Maybe i came on a bad day , but i will never be back anyway because i do not live close .
Can not wait to try other services !!
I could be snob - bish & state that it 's not even close to food in spain .
All the aforementioned minutiae does not matter one darned iota. why ?
Even though i 'd never been here before , it felt like i 'd been coming here for years .
Even though i had not eaten since yesterday 's lunch , i had to leave a couple bites on the plate .
Next time , i will not order the large , and i will not add extra cheese or meat , because it is superfluous .
Yesterday 's experience was not so efficient .
I have problems with this , but the trouble making dogs did not mess with thor , so i just kept him occupied with other dogs .
They do not do food here , but you can bring food into the bar .
I will be back time and time again , but please - if your dog is not having fun , just take him home .
Do not make the other dogs ( and owners ) deal with him .
However , sometimes i do not want such a fine dining experience .
There are days when i want quick and cheap ; and when i want a quick , cheap , and good torta , there 's one place that has not let me down : tortas paquimé .
I have had a few of their numerous tortas , and have not had a bad one .
And the tortas are not only good , but they are also pretty cheap .
I was told by many that this place is delicious but i just did not believe it .
I wish they had other side options as our only choice was chips , but other than that we had no complaints .
It 's hard not to go hungover from the debaucheries of the night before in vegas , but it 's well worth it !!
Service is pretty good , but not exceptional .
They include mayonnaise on their cheese steak , which is definitely not traditional .
I did not have any problem with that .
There was also no room in the men 's restroom for anyone with a wheelchair , which bothers me .
This is a piano bar which on occasion has good performers however has not always been consistent compared to others i have been to .
A potato dish with no fish tasted fishy .
Women complaining loudly about whoever was supposed to be on dish pit and what is or is not their job .
This older lady had absolutely no sense of urgency , and i watched my waitress make at least half of my order while other lady was getting confused between my order and the order of one other customer .
I did not like the kraft single slice on top of my grits .
I asked for cheese but did not realize that 's what they were working with .
No ... but for a $ 10 all inclusive dinner or $ 7 lunch it is hard to beat .
( can not remember the name ) if you are expecting the higher quality food of a true sushi restaurant or japanese steakhouse this is not the place , but i think it would be hard to find a better price / quality buffet .
They do not have pasta on the lunch menu but they will let you order it off the dinner menu .
I did not give this place 5 stars because it was not anything special and more of just a run of the mill type breakfast place .
You are missing out if you have not experienced it for yourself !
No cars around .
Update your hours if you are not open that late .
I have been here many times and never had a bad meal .
The hostesses are not friendly , and seem like you are bothering them for coming in .
Waitresses are not attentive and leave your cups empty , and plates at your table .
But it 's located in the epicenter , go up to the 3rd floor ( or was it 4th ? ) and it will be on the right , you can not miss it .
Expect to stand since seats will go pretty fast and i would not come here if you expect to dance , apparently some people will dance in their tiny little floor up front .
No complaints from me at all .
The managers tried to act like it was an oreo and like we had not seen it .
Do n't eat here .
I tried a slice and did not finish it because it was bland .
It was huge and looked good , but i did not try it .
Glad we tried the place , but i would not go back .
Dan and i went on a sunday afternoon and the place was hopping , but we did not have to wait .
We never had to wait for her to refill our drinks and the pizza was made within ten minutes .
I am a vegetarian and dan is not , but there was no problem splitting two toppings on each side with no extra charge .
The cheese was scruptous and fresh , and we did not leave a slice behind . pictures of italy decked the walls and the waitresses talked amongst one another in a sultry italian tongue .
Have limited time , feel guilty for not spending more time with my dog .
Do not get me wrong , charlotte is a nice town and all , but there is nothing really happening there that can command that price level .
This will not be on my repeat list .
Sometimes when i think i can not go on with the heat in las vegas , i go to the mall .
Actually i hate malls , but i really can not be that mad at this one because there is so much fun stuff there !
I could not love it more if i tried .
Some say the pizza is too cheesy , not crispy enough , but i think it 's great .
Overpriced , inadequate seating , which consisted of a long curved bench with small and uncomfortable metal chairs on the other side offering little privacy from your neighbor , inexperienced staff ( no silverware at table , had to ask for it to be brought out both for our salad and for our entree after it was served ) .
Not sure where this is traditional but nobody wants to put in work to eat a salad .
I get the same thing everyday & everytime there 's something they do not have or they do incorrectly .
But they need to be more detailed or specific about what they have or do not have .
I feel bad for the manager i have had 3 refunds with her & i know she 's probably annoyed about it but i can not pay anything that i am not fully satisfied .
She 's really nice & i know it 's not her fault .
It 's the only pie i have tried so far , because when i walk in the door i can not make my mouth say anything else .
You can not go wrong give them a try i bet you will go back !
It was not finger food , definitely requiring a knife and fork , but was big enough that it would best be split several ways .
The food was ok , but as a solo diner i did not really enjoy myself .
The supposedly tapa sized portions are actually quite large , and not conducive to ordering many dishes if one is dining alone .
There was no explanation of food specials or drink specials .
The beef was supposed to be spicy , but i did not taste any spices .
All in all , the food was acceptable although my wife could not finish her meal due to the fish sauce taste .
At $ 37.00 for two dinners and two appetizers ( we drank water ) it was not bad .
I swear they are not even by the register when they ask you your order .
I was born and raised speaking english , so it 's not like they are having a hard time understanding me .
I have been going here since it opened and i have never been disappointed in any way .
Can not say that i have had it better any where else .
Perfect place if your local but well worth a trip if your not !!!
Keep up the good work and promise to not to eventually lower the food quality like a lot of buffets do .
First , i was annoyed that this was not made clear with my initial question and second , it made me try to think of another restaurant that i have been to where they do not let you order off the full menu at the bar ??
The spring rolls were soggy and one of them had a decent amount of shrimp and the other did not have any shrimp !!
I am not sure what is being attempted with the threaded shrimp dish as it has a deep layer of " threads " that surround the shrimp , making it hard to eat .
I will not be back .
I am not a tortas aficionado , but i am willing to try something new , especially something that i would likely not try or stop at on my own .
We asked if they could adjust and they said they could not .
Each time i have been , i have never been able to get an actual seat inside , but the outer deck area is very nice .
I do not frequent dueling piano bars a lot , but the musicians at this one are pretty decent .
My only complaint was that there was not enough anchovies and too much of the avocado stuff instead .
( my dining companion was surprised that they did not ask us how we wanted our beef . ) without the sauce , it would be a bit dry .
With these desserts only be $ 1.99 , you do not feel bad ordering a bunch of them .
Having such late lunches , there are no crowds to deal with and you can enjoy yourself so much more .
We are always on the hunt for tapas and hubby was adamant about not going to firefly .
I had bookmarked re tapas , but hubby wanted to try ba ba reeba while we were at the mall so we thought we 'd be smarter this time and order only a small selection in case it was not all that great either .
I wanted to sit by some natural light for the purpose of taking photos but wherever i pointed out was not part of ba ba reeba .
The menu was not very big so it was quite easy to decide .
Sangria is not bad here --
It 's not sickly sweet and had a nice balance of the wine to fruit / juice .
I would not ordinarily order pizza at a tapas place but the one here was not bad as far as pizzas are concerned .
The crust was very thin and the toppings of chorizo , cheese and cherry tomatoes were balanced correctly -- not too much and not too little .
The meal was not cheap -- a pizza , 4 tapas and 2 glasses of sangria came to almost $ 80 with tip included .
Still , for a highly satisfying meal , i do not really care if it was on the high side .
It was pretty obvious she did not want to make small talk so said i wanted a chicken snack wrap .
Not only is it cheaper than starbucks but they have a good variety of coffee flavors .
I probably will not be back at this location though !
Love dunkin and will never stop visiting but 15 minutes in a drive through is a bit much .
I came here to try it out because i was craving tortas i was a little disappointed the meat had no flavor i felt like it was a little dry for almost $ 10 i expected more .
After seeing wait and cook staff behind the restaurant throwing " s not rockets " , wiping their noses , and then wiping on their aprons , i just could not find it in me to step a foot in that place again .
While some of the food is okay , what i had was not that tasty .
Dirty , dirty , it 's not kabab , it 's junk , they add lot of food color to cheap meat , very oily , low quality rice , i been there 2 week s ago , after the guy bring the food , i ask the owner to refund the money , he swipe the credit card and give me the receipted for refund but after 2 weeks no money back to my account , beware if you went there make sure , they do not give you fake refund receipt , this is baddest experience i had in restaurant , do not put your health on risk .
Do not burn your money by choosing this terrible restaurant !!!
I could hear the waitress acting like she did not know what a jacket was .
Will not be coming back
It 's great to have a place like the dog bar in charlotte , even if you do not have a dog !
Side note : just make sure your dogs do not have problems with xl dogs like great danes , there are always at least 3 or more there .
I would have never guess as the location is tucked away in an underground mini mall across campus .
I have always frequented the one on sunset which is now no longer part of the chain / franchise .
It was not that way at the other location .
2 . the combo comes with a bit of mast - akhir sauce on your plate ( no need for separate orders )
I mean no ill will .
It tasted very good and was made fresh and the place looked clean , so i feel bad giving it a bad rating but based on how many very fast trips i had to make to the restroom not long after visiting , i ca nt give it a higher rating at this time ...
She just started doing stuff , no info , no questions and she did not keep me posted even after i initially asked what she was doing .
Right after the cleansing , she did a really long " massage " which just did not feel very good .
It was weird to me , also because this took very long and when i go for a facial i want attention paid to my skin and not a 15 minute face / arm rub right in the beginning , not even if it would be a very good one .
I can go on and on about different little things that all amounted to the impression that the whole thing was rather amateur like - for 85 bucks ( had appointment misbooked , kept forgetting to not touch / rub my one arm bc of injury ) .
Will not be coming back , trust me there are like 3 better mexican food places near this one .
The kabob was spicy and did not come with a grilled tomato .
Persian kabob is not spicy and always is served with grilled tomato .
This is not persian food .
So if you have never been to this type of bar before , check it out before making assumptions .
There are 2 bars & the bartenders are pretty quick , but do not catch them when they go into their song & dance routine .
You will be stranded at the bar with no bartender in sight .
You will have a great time at you are 1st visit to howl at the moon , but just do not go there too often .
The ambiance , however , does not really make up for the service .
I do not recommend this as house of hunan is not kid friendly in the least .
There is no children 's menu and they do not serve child size portions .
Several different sushi rolls ( everyone really liked the key west ) , edamamme ( can not really jack that up ) , salads , tofu pad thai , lo mein , some kind of green beans , and chicken and broccoli .
I have only had tapas a few times and i am not completely drawn to it because it sounds like i will order a bunch of things and still not get full .
Well we ordered a lot because we were afraid of not getting full .
Walked over here sunday afternoon and there was no wait .
The olive oil was kinda bitter but i do not think it s my thing .
It was a lunch for 2 for 75 bucks not including tip .
Bacon was good and done ( not limp ) but not too crispy .
The lasagna was thick , with lots of noodles , not overly sauced , might could have used a touch more shredded cheese .
It had a good flavor - not the beat i have had , but better than many .
Crust was flavorful , do ne just right and no grease seepage from the sauce or toppings ( i like that ) .
I am not convinced i care for the sliced sausage .
It can not be beat !
Publc service announcement : do not steal the mai tai glasses .
Delicious and not your normal chinese buffet fare .
The one complaint is that there are not many dessert choices and the ice cream area is difficult to navigate
I reserved the party room which is not private but was very crowded and noisey .
I will not return ..... and while several others ( whom were not with my party ) complained as well ........ so i know it was not just me and my high standards !

I will not return ..... and while several others ( whom were not with my party ) complained as well ........ so i know it was not just me and my high standards !
I went to this restaurant just once ... the quality of the food is not well enough for the price , actually it sucks ...
( i emphasize that food comes with " little bit " of these sides ) the decoration of this damn place does not look like a high ranking restaurant ...
Subway or chipotle decorations are much more better ... i do not recommend it at all .
Not being a beer drinker , i ordered a rum and diet , which was $ 5 using the house rum ( still do not really know what that was ) , bacardi would have been $ 7 .
Like some other people who have commented , the conditions can become a bit unsanitary when you think about it too much , but that 's why they do not serve food .
After i watched him fix my mixed drink i could not get past the fact that he also handled the cleaning up in other areas and stuck to the canned drinks .
I can not believe i have never given a review for this place .
Believe it or not we have never tried the pizza , but it 's definitely on my list .
I can not wait to begin going again once they reopen .
I will say one big thing i dislike about this place ... no bread !!!
What kind of real italian place does not give you bread ??
Picture looks big but it was not bigger than half my hand balled up ) then she had the nerve to charge us a dollar for it !!!
And honestly , the pasta i got was overpriced considering there was no meat .
Not sure if i will be returning .
He will play with all the dogs and i have never had a problem there .
I wish there was at least 2 bartenders on busy nights because one is not enough .
It s a must even if you do not own dogs !
Everything tastes good with bacon and this was no exception .
This was a great place that 's not too expensive and we got to sample a lot of food that we normally would not eat .
Of course it 's not the same .
We did not go anywhere near the paella .
That 's one item i do not take risks on , for fear of disappointment .
The cava was our favorite , light and not cloyingly sweet .
Our bartender did everything right , coming by just when we may have needed her , fretted on our behalf that the bread had not come out yet , asked how we liked this and that , and never hovered .
Bonus : once you are inside , no obvious noises and lights of casinos .
No comparison ... but lately their service is atrocious .
I called corporate and really did not get anywhere with them either .
Got ta say , i am trying me best to not be a ' nancy ' here but seriously this just is not my kind of place to hang .
It does not look like much from the outside they have a very casual inside decor !
I have not had a dog in years ( tear rolling down my cheek ) but my gf does have a little dog , so i have been wanting a good reason to check out the dog bar in noda .... i have traveled all over the world , but never seen a place like this ... great idea .
I have not had a dog in years ( tear rolling down my cheek ) but my gf does have a little dog , so i have been wanting a good reason to check out the dog bar in noda .... i have traveled all over the world , but never seen a place like this ... great idea .
The place was well thought out to accommodate pooches of all sizes and the place is built so no manner of poop or pee pee would really do any damage or impact .... kinda like " kid proof " but in doggie type of manner .
If you have ever owned a dog ... well owned is not quite the right word , but i find those folks just nice and laid back .... and people are engaging and it 's an easy place to strike up conversation .
My family and i come here often when i do not feel like cooking .
The hibachi line gets super long but he never gets any help .
Some complain about the wait time or there 's not enough seasoning or whatever it is that stupid entitled people complain about .
In the meantime , i make it a point to always tip him well ( there 's a cash tip jar ) and talk to him if it 's not too busy .
He 's not the only hard worker - the waiters are all super attentive as well .
This is not a high end artisan pizzeria , but rather , a good ol ' family run pizza joint .
Being primarily pizza eaters , we have not tried all of the menu items , but the famous philly cheese steak sub is awesome .
Great food ( a great secret is the sushi roll dish " on the square " , it is not on the menu ) , good service and a trip to medina square is always enjoyable for me .
Do not try to sit there for dinner though , the chubby manager has not heard the saying that the customer is always right .
Like the menu , the pizza's are good but still not above alino 's .
They seem to have a timer in the room that they do not use .
I did not have a waffle , but my husband did and said it was great tasting .
The foods not consistent .
I ate here a few months ago and the food was great but yesterday it was not .
Some of the other dog parents were a bit over protective ( my dog is part border collie and is very vocal when she plays ) & i was not a fan of them trying to discipline my dog for having a good time ( i know , i am a ridiculous parent ...
It 's a good thing i do not have kids ) .
My only reason for not giving dog bar five stars is thatt a )
I do not like unisex bathrooms and b) they let two chihuahuas up on the bar , which seemed a bit icky to have dogs prancing around where the beer was served .
In the end we went with 1 of the vast number that looked good and in the end it did not disappoint .
I normally do not get french toast for breakfast but i will admit that i do like it .
This was a good choice , and i would not hesitate to get it again if we we nt back here .
The espresso was decent , not amazing .
I did get a second one but i am not sure i should have .
I am not sure how anyone gets coffee here the wait is worse than starbucks and it 's not anywhere close to as busy .
Can not go wrong going here !
This is not the best dunkin donuts location in this town .
No big deal i got the issue solved .
The gentlemen took my money and did not give me my order until the manager came out and apologized for the delay .
Today i ordered an ice coffee and the barista did not put cream in my coffee , it was so bitter .
I did not get time to taste my coffee because i was heading off to work .
Please remember that i have never had tapas before so i let my friend do all the ordering .
Oh man i do not even remember what we ordered but the chicken empanada's are freakin good .
Be prepared to break out the wallet though if you come around dinner time because it certainly is not cheap here .
I eat there at least twice a week & i am still not tired of it & do not think i will ever be !
From me : not bad , not great but not bad .
I have no idea why it has taken me so long to get to the dog bar - i have owned my pup for over a year and i always feel guilty leaving him for a night out .
Drinks were reasonably priced , there was a fire roaring in the fire pit and my friends and i brought our dogs - really what 's not to love for a low key night out .
I stopped in here before work to get a large iced caramel macchiato and it 's usually very sweet but , this time it was not sweet at all !!
Oh , and the workers there are pretty rude and act like they just do not want to be there ... hopefully next time will be better
The last times we visited it was not available .
I was too slow to confirm this nor could i get a camera out so oh wells , but if rich people will eat here , why not an average joe like me ?
The place is a bit small , i would not bring a group of 5 or more since none of the table can be together .
The wait was not horribly long , about 5 - 10 mins .
They are slow , do not bring refills of water or mixed drinks or ask if you want dessert which is only going to hurt business , however , it will not stop me from coming here .
This is spanish , not mexican like some others have mistakenly mentioned .
The portions were quite large for tapas , from looking at the other tables , so it 's not totally overpriced .
It was not mentioned on the list , but we also got shrimps mixed in which was nice .
They kept refilling it no problem along with our drinks .
I have never had a bad experience here , all the workers are extremely pleasant .
It was not explained before we ordered and no exception was made after the fact .
There happened to be a roach crawling in the restaurant but did not make it a big deal nor loss my appetite .
I was not impressed for a place that specializes in " tortas " .
I will not be coming here anymore .
Run down is not the right way to describe it , but it 's close .
You could drive by every day for a year and never notice it .
The entrees are in the nine - twelve dollar range ( do not quote me ) , and come with a salad and garlic bread .
I decided i could not go wrong with lasagna and was pleasantly surprised .
It was flavorful and did not have a cookie cutter taste .
Either way , should be served cold in order to not spoil .
I would not mind paying a premium to keep the riff raff out and improve the quality of food but as is , i will not be back .
I have never been to the chicago location , but i hope it 's as good as this !
Yummm ofcourse , i could never go here and not order sangria .
Ba ba reeba does not dissapoint .
Probably will not be back .
We went for lunch once when they first opened here in medina , and we only remember being not overly impressed and did not go back .
I do not know what .
The singapore noodles , described on the menu as having a yellow curry , included surprise ingredients that were not included on the otherwise very detailed description , eggs and mushrooms of some sort .
I suppose we should always ask about mushrooms since i am averse to them and you never know when a chef will add them to something .
Anyway , i do not think we will try again .
No substance whatsoever .
Not worth $ 1.09 .
But that 's the fault of the corporation , not this store .
No dozen donuts should cost over $ 5.99 .
It 's not a tippable job .
Please , america , do not support tip cups anywhere , any time .
Waffle house has never let me down and this location did not either .
They are a must to order , even if you have never been much of a waffle person before .
They can not go wrong with baking in the " toppings " .
Can not wait to go back !
Will not be back ever again !
I was helped by devin who was extremely courteous and did not mind changing my order he had great customer service and very friendly .
The 2 tortas i have tried so far ( the mexicana and the cubana ) have both tasted great , and the cubana really was distinct from the other chain ' beto places in that every meat could be tasted distinctly and not as some meat mash .
The atmosphere in here was very pleasing , not bad drink specials and the live music was very entertaining .
Oven baked goat cheese - i do not think you can go wrong with goat cheese , tomato sauce , and bread with pesto .
Seared sea scallops - a bit gritty and did not have the melt in your mouth quality i look for in amazing scallops .
Not the best i have ever had , but definitely not the worst .
If you like tapas and want a meal that will not break the bank on the strip , this is not a bad place to give a shot .
I have never been to a waffle house so i wanted to give it a try ...
The only down side were some of the owners who would not keep an eye on their dogs at all .
There was one in particular , a born and white dog with an orange color that was running around growling and harassing the other dogs while the owner was not paying attention in the least .
It 's not on the menu !!!!!
Not sure if the masseuse was certified for pregnant massages , but my wife did not even have her back massaged ( not because she did not want it ) , was jerked around on the table , and she was unfocused throughout .
Overall , the experience was not relaxing at all .
I will probably give evolve another shot next year , but this experience was not worth the hassle of driving there , let alone the cost .
Besides the fact our doggies were intimidated to death , and did not move around too much ( would you move around and wag your tail if you were 5 pounds and the place was taken over by 160 pound great danes ?? )
It just did not gel for us .
It 's a great concept ... simple b/c you can bring your own food , and it 's a relaxed setting ... but again , something about drinking around wet pee spots of gravel and poo did not sit right with me .
The only downside that kinda made me nervous is when some of the dogs decide they are not liking each other very much .
Also , another thing to note is that if you have not been here in a while they have remodeled the place some and the bar is back against the far wall as you come in , it really opened up the space and looks much nicer and brighter than the old dark dankness it use to exude .
First timers to waffle house and we could not have been happier .
We could not be happier with this first visit and now it will not be our last !!
I do not think i have ever seen a buffet so big with as much variety .
If you are looking for a dueling piano bar this is not the place .
There is no comedy in the show just basically someone singing an entire song .
Will never come back .
Our groupon voucher was declined by the cashier stating that we had to use it at their other location at henderson which is about 30 miles away , although the groupon voucher did not state this , the cashier admitted that the goupon voucher was valid but not at this location as he put it , " we have two stores you have to go to the other one " i informed the cashier that this was not stipulated in the goupon order and the restaurant is empty anyway and why not just take our order since there is no one in here at 2;00 pm ?
, nevertheless he said no ca nt take it .
I do not mind paying extra but she should have let me tell her what i wanted before swiping my card & handing it back to me .
( the two donuts at 40 cents extra equals the total price of the # 1 as stated on the menu so i am not really paying " extra " rather saving 80 cents if i get 2 regular donuts ) day 2 : ordered the # 1 again .
I would still visit this location again but i would make sure to be extremely specific so they do not mess up anything .
My only issue was that my masseuse asked for particular things that are included and i might like , whereas my partner 's did not , so we did not get the same options .
A place where you can go to drink and bring your dogs and they can play with other dogs and you do not have to worry about them .
I feel like the owners do not really take care of the bar .
Also dogs pee in the water buckets and no one is paying attention to them to clean them out and other dogs are drinking from the water bucket that for peed in .
We used to like the medina house of hunan very much years ago , but not any longer .
I would not recommend it any more .
It was so much worse than larb 's version that i could not finish it .
It looked disgusting and had no flavor .
We tried to get a third table for our group , since there were 12 of us , but a worker came over and was actually really rude to several of us and said we did not have enough people for 3 tables , that we needed four to a table ... we had 12 people , 12 divided by 3 is 4 the last time i checked - it was honestly really silly , but if the guy was just friendly about it , it would not have been an issue at all .
The drinks were really great , for 20 or 25 bucks you can get their ' bucket ' , which comes in a variety of flavors and they will not let you order one unless you have 4 or more people going to drink it - it 's just that strong !
I did have a lot of fun , but mostly because of the people that i was with , not because of the high prices and rude workers .
My only other comment is that the crowd on a friday night was a bit older - i 'd guess the average age to be 35 - 45 , and most of my friends are 25 - 32 , not that there is anything wrong with that :) just want people to be aware of the typical crowd to expect :)
This is not the place .
This is not the place .
Pay the extra 3.00 for the tenderloin ( ground meat is just not as good ) .
The saffron rice is excellent ( not hard , not watery , just right ) .
The lamb is great , just not normal palate ( the adventurous will love it ) .
Best was that the flavor was not overpowering , yet was infused throughout .
No need to add salt or pepper .
Again , do not go for the decor ...
Always , always clean no matter how busy they are .
I never considered that before but it was very tasty .
Do not eat gyros with roach meat .
And this seemed to just be run of the mill , no apologies for the crazy long wait for food , or for the fact that temps were way off .
At the end of our meal , we let the manager know we were disappointed in the experience , and he seemed , not only nonplussed , but annoyed to have been disturbed from running his mouth with members of his staff .
We were a large party , and we never tip less than 20 % , so one would think there would be an effort made to simply retain the customers ... but not so much .
Will not be back and will continue to tell people what a disappointing experience this place offers ...
They have heaters and without this place i would not get through winter with my puppy .
I am not fat or anything , i just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit .
No flavor and it actually looked more like a iced tea than a iced coffee .
The pizza had sooooooo much cheese , it was way toooo much . ( that we were putting it aside when it slide off the pizza not needing it back on the pizza !! ) the service was okay .
I do not like the primitive way they write out tickets you can not read them and it feels like the owner just rings up whatever !!
Not to mention how uncomfortable i was the out dated and sardine can feeling bathrooms !!
This area is not my fortay usually , but i got a certificate for valentine 's day from my husband this year and it turned out to be an amazing gift .
I would never had thought about getting a facial , but it was so enjoyable and my skin was glowing for a week .
I apologize , as i forgot her name and can not refer you to her ; i was like a happy drunk already after getting 60 minutes of massage .
Onto the food : awesome ; get the paella their house specialty and do not be afraid of the mushroom empanadas they were amazing .
While i do not get to go as often as i would like , every experience i have had there has been a positive one .
The food comes in small portions so we were worried that we would not have enough .
Not so much if you do not .
They constantly filled our drinks back up and when they brought the food they timed it well enough to where we did not have all the entrees at the table at once .
Not to mention this place is so affordable !
Trust me though you will not leave there hungry .
I do not recommend coming here if you want quality .
One of the nimrods at the register could not do math so my buddy ended up paying an extra $ 5 because the worker was in denial and had a powerful belief that the $ 5 bill my friend had already handed him was nonexistent .
Luckily my friend did not really argue because it seemed futileso he gave the guy an extra 5 .
They need to do something about that ; probably the fan is not enough to filter the air and environment or their hibachi grill is just stinking up too much .
This place does not have a bright future with employees like the punk who works the door .
The lentil soup is like nothing i have ever had , it is not mushy & the spice combo is on point .
Do not forget to try the green like salsa on the condiments bar inside .
There was enough spice to know it 's there but not overpowering .
Especially since we do not speak french .
I have passed by here many times but i have never been inside .
Can not go wrong here .
I admit , it spiked my curiosity enough to try it , even though we have passed by it regularly over the past few years and never had the urge before .
I thought it tasted frozen ... like something from a high school cafeteria ... and the cheese had no flavor .
I have no idea who would ever think this pizza is the best in the whole wide world ...
Maybe it 's all a matter of taste ... but we are completely flabbergasted . after discussing for a while what we were eating , we looked around and realized that no one else in the entire place was eating pizza .
I do not think we ever even finished our leftovers .
I hate giving a place 1 stars , and recently i read on a friend 's facebook update that they had just discovered hop and could not believe that they had gone their whole lives in this neighborhood without having ever tried it .
I had never been to a tapas place before , and this was a great first time experience .
Not on the happy hour menu , but wanted to try it anyways .
We also got 2 desserts , which i am not sure what the name was .
I would love to go back to try the paella and other tapas not on the happy hour menu ( there are 10 choices on the happy hour menu ) .
Tortas are not the only mexican fare served up here but are the reason i return !
They bake it daily and bread is not for individual sale .
Even though this place is in a mall , it does not feel like it .
I was not sure what to get but i ended up ordering a burrito combo .
I have been here plenty of times and never even had a slice of pizza ( and i love pizza lol ) but i am too obsessed with the cheese steaks to even try !!!
Lucky me , i used to live there so i stayed with a close friend , no need for the extra expense on the hotel .
A bucket was 20 bucks .... split between 5 people , it is not bad .
She started off super nice , but then completely ignored us and did not even want to take our orders anymore .
Like many other reviews here , i did not try the american food items offered .
Does not make sense to me to eat these while in a oriental food place .
While this place has two bone shaped swimming pools , dog beds and games for adults to play , it is not that clean .
The humans also are not that fast at cleaning up after their dogs .
They have buckets of water for the dogs , for those are clean , but they are not dog bowls , and a chihuahua knocked a bucket down just like that .
The bar inside is also very dark and not airy .
I 'd recommend lucky dog over this place , parking can also be complicated here as well , though they have their own lot , there are not that many spots .
If you have not been to a waffle house before ... well ...
Basically , they have delicious breakfast foods , and then a variety of other lunch / dinner options , but if you are at waffle house and you are not eating breakfast , you are doing it wrong .
Many food selection here , waitstaff is nice and clean up quickly so that plates do not pile up .
The sushi is good ; no fresh seafood in charlotte and i am from hawaii but it was pretty good quality .
Here 's something i had not noticed the first review but have in the dozen or so visits since : the wait staff is scruffy .
It ai not that tough .
( i am never going back on a tuesday , though .
Worst place ever for food service do not waste your time or money .
The staff does not understand when you want something specific .
Hibachi grill was not very clean and the bathrooms smelled like hard urine .
Please do not waste your money
They used a sweet mayo which i normally do not like , but it worked so nicely with the meat .
If you are looking for a last minute party , this is not the place for you !
My mom had a voucher from restaurant.com for 25 $ and we had to buy a minimum of 37.5 $ to use it which was no big deal for the 4 of us .
No offense to the owner , but you are running a business .
Do not tell me that you opened up your restaurant in front of the university so that students such as myself who are looking for halal food will have a place to eat .
If you are not willing to work at keeping your customers happy , we will find another place to eat .
Can not wait to go back !!
I have never eaten dine in but i have ordered many take out pizzas of all kinds .
With that said , the only reason i did not give five stars is becuase i have not had luck with other entress .
I tried the meatball sub , which i will never order again , and the philly , which was so so .
Lots of people but no wait .
This is probably a fun night if you just happen through and have no expectations .
No problem i was told .
He , with much attitude rudely informed me that there was no way the could find 3 extra seats ( even though it was 8 pm and there were hardly filled to capacity ) .
Again , he with much attitude did not want to hear what i had to say and in fact abruptly cut me off stating he did not care what evidence i had , and the manager i had communicated with was no longer with the company .
I calmly asked for the manager and he said you can ask for the manager but it will not change anything .
Here i am , coordinating a birthday party with 15 folks ... sir i really do not want to get into a argument over 3 extra seats there was more back and forth with the manager .
She stated the seats would cost and i let her know there was no problem so the seats were brought over as apart of the package , the birthday guest get to come up on stage and do a little dance and have some fun .
He was told , if you do not pay extra you do not get called up .
In fact , it all makes sense now because we must have put in ten song request and not one was played .
We had not been to one in many , many years .
Do not get me wrong , the prices were decent and the establishment fairly clean .
( see my photo . ) give me a straight forward list with prices not all this back and forth , look here and there , here are the up sells , type menu .
I can read , i do not need a picture of a scrambled egg .
I could not believe the look of my waffle .
I do not know what i was expecting , but has my husband said , " it 's the waffle house " meaning we were expecting amazing looking waffles .
I did not use it .
They did not look very appetizing at all .
It was not my favorite meal ever and we likely not be back .
Just not our kind of place .
Not only was the waiter really nice , he gave us the happy hour discount even though we did not sit by the bar ( my sister is 15 so we could not sit there ) .
Got there not ready at the time they said it would be .
Food was not the worse .
Definitely not good either .
Falafel was dry and lacked texture the pita they boast about is just ok also had a gyro salad , lettuce quality was not good .
Not worth the $ 13 though .
The food that i tried was decent and did not seem to be overly laden with sugar , salt , or msg .
I am not big on buffets , but i hang out with people who are .
Racist had an incompetent waitress who could not remember to bring my drinks and then they had the nerve to send and unwoke black security guard to tell the party i was with we had to leave because we did not order drinks for 45 mins really ??
So the drinks i did get was not enough and you want me to leave here intoxicated .
Do nt worry about me spending my money here no more .
I know it wo nt hurt you much but it will hurt enough if my sisters and brothers believe that the are racist and do not spend your money there ..
I am sorry , dude , but playing the same three notes on the trumpet ten times in a row is not helping anyone .
You can not believe how terrible is this place food !
Not fresh meat , no tasty !!
Never ever try it
Now i m not trying to be critical .. but i guess i was expecting better ...
They have very different techniques but i very much enjoyed seeing both of them equally , so you really can not go wrong between the two of them .
More recently , i came in for a half brazilian wax with julia , and i have never had a more positive waxing experience in my life .
My only gripe with this place is the hibachi grill , this guy can not cook that well .
My food is always burned and just does not taste that great .
Does not work that well .
It 's not the best chinese style food but it 's filled with many options , low cost and quick .
There is no reason to waste your time or money on eating here .
Was not a good kabob experience .
The taste was not as good as many other places for the money i paid .
I would not say it 's the best quality food we have had but for $ 10 you can not get much better .
Also the presentation of my sushi ( which usually is not a big deal to me ) but today was very noticeable that the sushi was made in a rush and looked like it was just tossed on my plate .
Although the food is fresh with everything else it is not worth the price point .
Which is why i do not come very often .
Maybe not again after today 's experience .
Except i was a little sick , and drinking ... so i do not remember much else to type anything more .
The big buckets are not tasty but they will do the trick ..
I never drink them , but i do buy them for college kids who work in my office for fun .. lol usually less of a line than whiskey river , the forum or cans .. and a sometimes a less " trendy " crowd ..
Every now and then the whole staff gets up on the bars and does a dance .. that can be entertaining .. some things to note : the parking is in the garage of the epicenter and there are a bazillion steps to climb up to the third floor , there is an elevator , but i do not know if there is one that goes up to this level .. so do not get hammered and then try to walk down ..

Basically it is a " your list gets in without cover " offer ... there is nothing vip about it .. so do not fall for that ..
It is still cool , but do not tell people you are going to be vip becz you will just be embarrassed when basically all they get is free cover ...
The chocolate doughnut does not even have an even amount of chocolate on top .
They we asked again why we could not get the pink sprinkles doughnuts .
After asking again why they did not have sprinkles she finally said she could put them on .
It 's not like it was closing time or anything .
Great customer service ... not the one thing i could say i liked about this location is there coffee .
If i could go back i would not ... even turn that way .
Do not waste your money on doughnuts here , the coffee is good though can not say about the customer service .
This experience has forced me to not even attempt to go through the process of introducing my girlfriend 's dog vixie to this community .
If you are considering joining this bar make sure you do not park in this parking lot 15 minutes before opening because you are more likely to be told to move your car than you are to be asked if you are interested in learning about the bar and how to have a prospective puppy join .
On the surface , it 's not much to brag about , but the food more than makes up for it .
From pizza and sandwiches , to greek favorites like gyros and spanikopita , to desserts , you can not go wrong .
I am not a big buffet person , my husband is , however , & agreed with my assessment .
The place set up and decor is very minimal , but how many places you could go hang out with your friends and at the same time you do not have to leave your dogs at home .
There are plenty of sitting , dogs could run free , and you are allowed to bring your own food since they do not serve any .
This is not a place for you if you want to see and be seen , but this is a very good place if you just want to hang out with your friends along with your four - legged friends .
Good was good , but not good enough for such a huge price increase .
No wonder the restaurant was not busy @ 6:30 pm when we picked up our order .
I can not remember the last time i was served food so hot i had to wait for it to cool .
That 's not the worst way to start .
I do not need to bond , just eat .
Not a cheap meal , but well worth the cuisine , atmosphere , and service .
I did not have the sushi today , but if the overall cleanliness of the restaurant is any indication of the sushi bar i am glad i passed .
And whatever possessed the owners to put carpet in a high traffic flow / high turnover restaurant like this i will never know .
It looks like they have not bothered to clean it since they opened - yuck !
I am not here to recommend another chinese buffet , but without mentioning a name there 's another one right up the road across the street from the hilton that is much better , at least for now .
I have not had a massage since moving to the city and i had a wonderful experience at evolve .
If i had not read the reviews here on yelp i would have kept walking !!
Although the food was not fantastically memorable , it was very good , especially since there were so many vegetarian options at a tapas bar .
No , they do not actually have teriyaki chicken soup on the menu , but the chicken and veggies were swimming in so much liquid , it spilled over the edges of the container when the lid was removed .
But still not as disappointing as the bland eggrolls , and the crabless , cold crabmeat with cheese ( rangoons ) .
The pad thai was not terrible , but not as good as it 's been in the past , while dining in the restaurant .
The only reason this review gets two stars , is because the spicy crab salad was delicious . . . but still not worth the $ 50.
I have never once been asked for any type of membership until recently i was asked to leave since i did not have one .
I have not once seen any dog with this elusive dog tag membership ?
Do not think i will be a regular here anymore which is unfortunate since it was walking distance from my home .
The interior has not been updated in almost forever but it does not matter , food is excellent and prices are very cheap .
You will not regret it !
If you like sweet / citrus ginger dressing , do not order this .
We were there no longer than usual , but our waiter was a little too helpful .
He then went on the critic other items on the menu and inform us of items food critics did not enjoy .
Once again , we thought this whole conversation was odd ; not helpful .
Side note - if you have small children , make sure you are not seated by the waterfall and they do not have a children 's menu .
I would not go back .
The food was not bad , but there were so many people in the place , with a dj pumping somewhat obnoxious pop songs , that the ambiance became more of a factor than one would have hoped .
That was our intention , and frankly i can not imagine why anyone would want more than a spoonful of it .
Better than other tapas places i have been to , but i am not sure that we will be back any time soon .
Not sure why ppl like this place so much .
As george bush said " fool me once shame on you , you will never fool me again . "
Still not sure if i enjoyed it ... the woman who did mine seemed distracted and at one point was on her phone for a couple minutes during the middle of my facial .
Also , i usually get a gel manicure and they do not provide this service , so i will most likely go get a manicure elsewhere next time .
I agree with the other reviews that it is not relaxing with the nail area in the front of the waiting area of the spa .
Overall , i look forward to my next massage with helen but will not go for the other services again .
Ah , we have been dreaming of good pizza , and novanta does not disappoint .
I like to get there a little early to score a table and avoid the cover charge , it gets really crowded around 9 , do not expect to get seats after this unless you play the vulture for your group .
I advise finding drinks specials elsewhere or pre-partying at home before coming in , drink prices can rack up here on a normal night and drinks are not particularly strong either .
There is also a small buffet included but i never tried the food .
I did have my massage during one of the wind storms , and becky apologized for the wind gusts but i did not mind at all .
The one tip that i would say is that i love scented oils , usually lavender during a massage but the oils were not scented .
I am not sure , but for my next appointment i will inquire about that .
So i we nt today for my caramel iced coffee , super excited and to my surprise it was not good at all .
You could taste sugar particles ( did not have this issue all 7 days i went in ohio ) and there was not a lot of cream in it .
The normal order is 3 pieces but my wife can not eat that much .
The band that was playing that night was not the best but it was hilarious to listen to .
Not even rabies , leading to a serious health risk .
# 3 . there 's not enough room for the dogs to run around , so it can sometimes turn into a hump fest with irresponsible owners that are not paying attention # 4 .
They do not monitor or supervise , check dogs , or keep anything close to clean . # 5 . there is a douchebag there that owns a 220 + english mastiff that is known to be aggressive toward puppies that are not neutered yet , and yet will act like a greek god and say it s your fault .

Hope i do not run into him again . # 6 . if you have an older , calm dog , and do not mind hanging out is a cesspool of dog piss , it may be alright .

But if that 's not you , bring a beer to the dog park , or check out the cornelius dog bar bark and brew .
I can not believe i am reviewing waffle house , but here goes .
If you have never been to a waffle house before , the food is exactly what you 'd expect : greasy , unhealthy , and strangely enticing .
I normally would not put cheese eggs and grits at the top of my " to - eat " list but few things sound better after a night of drinking .
I do not know if it is always so immaculate , but i was shocked .
I am used to a waffle house that looks like an unkempt trailer on the inside , not a passable budget restaurant .
Seems like they always come with a bagel too , as if a begel is not already it s own meal !
Never had a bad dish & love dining in at this location .
One of guys said they could not do that because of some bs story about how it cuts into profits and all the doughnuts they sold in a day .
I was welcome to pull 36 napkins one at a tine from the dispenser but they would not give it to me in a stack .
I just spent over $ 30 in doughnuts but you will not give me a stack of napkins ?
What 's going to eat into your profits is the fact that i will not ever come here again and i will not recommend this shop to anyone .
We drive by this place often and say " it looks so sketchy that it must be great ! " well ... it is not .
It is not terrible , but it certainly is not great .
- the food in general was just not great .
I had the chicken parmesan and the marinara sauce did not have any robust flavors .
The chicken did not taste fresh .
Even my garlic bread did not have a strong garlic taste .
I ordered uncle sam no bun very delicious and southern style omlette no lyannaise potato sub with cold tomato .
Dog bar has been a favorite of mine for a bit but i have never been impressed enough to write a review until last night .
They always have great local beers on tap , my dog has a great time and i have never had any issue .
Another dog was not taking too kindly to mine and kept coming up and being pretty aggressive towards him . i was not too worried because of my dog being very submissive and always backing down from those behaviors .

From my experience the mia owner is not normal , i have always experienced people having a good eye and read on their pups .
I do not think you can go to any dog bar and be surprised when dogs are acting like dogs .
This being my first injury since adopting i had no idea what to do and was in a bit of shock .
This will not be our last adventure to the dog bar .
While the look of the old building and interior decor may not seem that impressive , the pizzas that they make are well worth stopping in for .
The pizza sauce was a little sweet but not overly so .
Love the pizza , salads and subs not to mention the great smells inside .
Personally i do not care for the pasta dishes because the sauce is a little heavy for my taste .
No wait on my food for pick up .
It 's orange -y in color and really just not tasty at all .
I am warning you now , do not get it ...& if you do , do not say i did not tell you .
Just a good ol ' american breakfast with hearty portions and good presentation - not to mention delicious !
It was so much fun - i had not been to a dueling piano bar since college .
Prices not bad for the area .
I did not have a great experience , and would not return .
On the other hand , it was a hot stone massage and i do not think that was really her " thing . " most of the stones were so hot they had to be removed ; this happened numerous times so i was kind of on edge waiting for the next one each time .
I have not had that experience with a hot stone massage elsewhere .
It also just was not very relaxing ; the stones felt like an afterthought rather than being integrated into the strokes .
I think a good spa should know the staff 's strengths and weaknesses and assign customers accordingly so this does not happen .
I can not think of anything good to say about the manicure .
Not relaxing , spa-like , or professional at all , more like the local beauty shop .
The technician was drinking from an open fast food cup while doing my nails and snacking right next to me as my nails dried - not a very hygienic practice .
One poor woman in a spa robe walked by through the busy waiting and manicure area and you could see right through the robe ; i can not believe they had her change and walk through like that .
All of this is somewhat nitpicky , but created an atmosphere i would not want to return to and i wanted to share the details for others making the same decision .
On the other hand , if you need an every day run of the mill basic service , the prices are decent and it 's not a bad place - again just nothing fancy or particularly " sap like . "
Even though the service here was not rude i am still going to give eggspectation 1 star since my friend got wretched sick from food poisoning here and it was a complete waste of time and money .
Our server was not intentionally rude but she was clearly overwhelmed and inefficient .
I got the american , and it was evident that i should have ordered canadian bacon as my meat because they did not know american bacon .
My friend ordered the french toast side and come on we were around french canadians , the french toast should not have looked so nasty !
Not awesome .
Do not waste your precious tourist dollars and limited time at this nasty place .
The atmosphere is relaxing , and the amenities are exactly what you need , and nothing you do not .
No bloody mary mix here !
They do not have a kitchen , but they welcome you to bring your own take out from anywhere .
If that 's not proof enough that we love this place , i do not know what is .
I have never had a bad experience at a salon , but this was just terrible .
Instead of apologizing , the man got upset with me and implied that it was our fault , by saying we must not have requested a woman .
He then left me in a room , naked in a robe for at least fifteen minutes only to return to tell me i could not get a massage and that this was a ' deal ' since they would not charge me for it .
So i ended up paying for a sub- par manicure and facial i never would have bought without the massage .
Nearly three weeks later , no call .
Aside from all this the place was generally dirty upstairs , the receptionist did not know how to use the system , and the employees looked unkempt .
First of all the service was extremely bad and unpleasant ; i ordered my food and it took too long and i also ordered soup they did not bring it to us and did not refund us , when i came to ask for some cups the cashier took too long to see what i wanted as he was talking on the phone for too long .
I do not recommend this restaurant for anybody
Too cakey for me and not many blueberries at all .
You can not go wrong with any menu item in my opinion .
I do not care for their elote -- it 's served as a gloppy mess in a cup instead of on the cob !
The quince and cheese is not to be missed even if it sounds like an odd combination .
This place is by no means a traditional pizza place , nor is it what most people would call a traditional brick oven pizza place .
If that 's what you are looking for , well this place is not for you .
If you go to say a moroccan restaurant and you have never had true moroccan food before , you are not going to be upset ( or at least you should not be ) because it was not what you expected .
I do not know or have any affiliation with the owners .
Called around to several places , with no luck for reservations since it was valentine 's weekend .
I have to say i was a little concerned over the menu not having a large selection of items , and many of the people in our party being picky eaters , but when the food came out , everyone was happy !
The toppings on the pizza are high quality , and cover just enough of the pizza not to overwhelm the chewy pizza crust and delicate tomato sauce .
Even though it was not busy it still took about 30 minutes before our breakfast was served .
Loved it all the way from toronto ... food was amazing but the noise was not pleasant ..
I watched people walk out because they did not understand the menu or they were looking for enchilada especial ... white people .... this is a spanish restaurant .
Spanish does not equal mexican .... so of course babareeba 's changed their menu to better suit the vegas crowd .
But the entrees are not bad .
Mmmm .... the paella is not bad .
They also have skewers of meats to select from and a caldera .... mmmm different meats , seafood , etc. the caldera is pretty salty - if you can not handle it , i 'd stay clear .
Never had a problem with service - but you know some times you get a bad batch of employees .
Very good , but sometimes i can not hear myself there .
No good at all .
Not only were there not enough coats applied to my nails , the nail polish was all over my skin .
The dough was not the highlight of the pizza which is always nice .
Hmmm not sure what is 4 - 5 star worthy but not the meal i ordered .
There 's no dressing or anything to bring it together and one cherry tomato cut in half stuck randomly in the sandwich is a no go ... especially due to it not being fresh .
Not the best regarding ambience and the location but then again , we were there really late when all the stores around them were also closed .
The salads were superb , but the pizza tasted very plain to me , and my son was not a fan .
Not only was it relaxing , the aesthetician tailored the facial to meet my individual skin care needs .
If yelp was not so hung up on integers , i 'd give this place 3 and a half stars .
Do not let the location scare you off .
I agree it is not fast but you see them cooking your order with fresh ingredients and that just takes some time .
I had the chicken torta and i did not add any sauces - do that because it is a little bland .
I have not been here in a year , cuz every time i ordered - they forget my coffee ; i run late for work !
Astroturf is not as hygienic as they make you believe and i have seen several owners simply spray their pets poop with a hose , this only spreads around the feces .
Everything below hip level has been peed on and there really is no hand sanitizer except for what you bring .
I think if this concept were really going to work , put a bar in a dog park not a dog park in a bar .
I can not wait to refer my friends to her & i can not wait for my next appointment .
My eggs beni were amazing , super fresh and perfectly made , not too oily or overdone .
Yea sure the happy hour is good but the food sure is not .
Just walked into the w. sahara dunkin donuts as the drive thru was not accepting debit cards .
When i walked in there were two people having conversation amongst themselves and never acknowledged me .
Another employee walked from the back looked at but also no acknowledgement .
Sunday afternoon when everyone goes out to eat and they never have what you want , it 's fair that they offer you something else but you go exactly there for one reason .
As we stepped in , the tall hostess did not even crack a smile .
Food was very bland , not a typical thai food at all .
Since there was no kick of spice to my dish , i asked for some sriracha to help the food taste a little better .
I have been eating at restaurants all over , north , south , east , west but i never heard of being charged for hot sauce at a semi fancy restaurant .
Overall , service was ok and the food was not all that great .
To openly admit my bias , i have never been a fan of piano bars .
Because of the musical styling , i can only imagine howl being a place i would start or end my night , but never as a bar i stay for the entire night out .
Was nice and clean but the food was average and not memorable .
The upside is that the sushi was super and we did not have anywhere to be , the downside ... we were there for 2.5 hours for lunch , seriously ?!
I think it was the manager who was at the front when we walked in and we were frankly not paid attention to for about 5 minutes , i was stunned , but my in - laws have the patience of a saint , so i kept my mouth shut and waited .
In case you are wondering , they were not slammed busy .
Once we sat down , our server was very friendly but almost never came around to check on us , we had to get up and find him to get the check . 3 stars because the food was yum .
After purchasing 65 $ worth of food for my family it was a freaking joke ..... so the young guy forgot to mention that there is no rice available at the moment and it was disgusting ..... you get 6 tiny pieces ..... coming from afghanistan this is completely a joke ..... the chicken breast are suppose to big and thick slices and no ends to the breast ..... but we got cartilage and tiny burnt ends ..... i will never come here again and none the less you would think you would compensate for not having rice .... but the guy gave us a few more pieces of chicken breast and said there was nothing else .... and the refund would take 5 business days instead of just giving us a cash refund .

Ugh i am done never again
Could not eat it .
I never once had a bad experience here .
But man i do not even know if we can ever go back knowing this happened and it sucks because their food really is good , see old review below .
This place did not close down they just changed the name to the river buffet .
See my original review below : do not waste your time or $ $ going to any other asian buffets in the charlotte area .
I have been to sushi only buffets that did not have the selection this place has .
Seriously it is head & shoulders above buffet sushi pretty much anywhere i have ever been aside from perhaps rusan 's ( in atlanta , have never tried rusan 's in charlotte but i hear they also do sushi buffet lunch ) .
It 's clean for a buffet , i do not feel sketched out about the quality or origin of what they serve like some places .
It is also blessedly not full of msg .
I could not eat here if it was .
My husband and i live 45 minutes away but we still would rather go here than anywhere near us because those places suck so much and cost the same or more , we do not want to be disappointed .
Decided to give this place a try and so glad we did and we will definitely be back on another trip . i had the all star breakfast with raisin toast and grits i ve never had grits before but very yummy and the ice tea is delicious .
When we spoke with him he did not really seem to care ... was not even apologetic until we called him on apathetic .
We promptly left and have no intention of going back .
Great drinks too and they do not mind if you order in or bring a picnic .
The color and flavor are both off as well , the yellowtail is opaque and not a hint of pink .
They do not mess up he salmon , and the tuna is alright .
All the other items are typical of a chinese / mongolian / japanese buffet ( not the three separately , it is typical of any place that offers all three ) .
When i booked , i asked for an organic refresh facial and left out the express since no other facial was listed as " organic refresh " .
However , they put it as a custom facial since i did not specify .
If they have two facials with the same name , but different prices , they either need to specify this on their website , or clarify with the person who is booking the service - especially if the person have never been to the spa before .
I wish that this had not happened because i did enjoy my services , but i do not feel comfortable returning .
Awesome do not have these at home always a treat to find one near me on holiday waitress was pleasant cook was well trained and food was delish thanks wafflehouse for a happy tummy
Have not tried the ice cream but it looked very good !
Does not even apologize .
I must admit buffets are usually not my first pick .
The atmosphere is not the best .
The food is , as expected , not the freshest .
The restaurant is very crowded and sometimes little kids may not understand sanitary expectations and pick stuff up with their hands and other little things like that .
A lot of the food in itself is not my favorite .
Overall it 's a good place to take the family on a budget but , not the first pick .
I ordered a waffle and a covered hash browns ( covered means with cheese ) and i got a waffle that was so obviously dark and burnt and a hash browns with no cheese .
I pointed out the no cheese and the waitress was very nice so i did not send it back .
They would not give me a waffle that was burnt or not up to waffle house standards would they ?
I pointed this out as i paid and the cashier very nicely offered to not charge me but of course i paid for it ... i ate the whole thing and it still tasted good , not just the awesome waffles ice come to expect from waffle house .
I do not send stuff back unless it 's just horrible , plus you have to wait a long time for the replacement .
Not noisy !
The do not put salt and pepper on the table which always strikes me as an affectation and there are no paper towels in the restroom .
That did not stop us from dancing .
It was before 11 pm and not many were drunk or dancing .
When the waiter asked what i though of the meal he suggested i told him that the duck was not all that great and he apologized .
Not greasy at all and fresh veggies with the salad .
Loved the sangria , i tried the one with frangelico and it was not my bag so the server let me switch to the house white sangria .
But he 's not .
As you can probably tell , this is not a bar for every dog .
If your pup is teeny and / or easily intimidated , it may not be the best fit ... especially during a busy night .
As tonya said , if you are not a dog person , i would not venture in here .
The dogs are friendly and sociable ... many of them have no qualms strutting up to you , asking for an ear scratch or a belly rub.
Even though riley ( my dog ) will never be a guest of the dog bar , i am happy to go in his honor every once in a while to grab a beer and give some love to the neighborhood pooches !
Not located in the best of areas but you would think they were getting ready for the president to arrive and dine !
The cashier was extremely friendly , not pushy , offered a sample of their homemade chicken soup while i was deciding ( since it was a chilly 40 degrees outside it really hit the spot ! ) .
I love this place really good , really clean , not to expensive , and food taste great . come here all the time .
Best tortas in the whole state of arizona tortas paquime no hay otro lugar que ni se les acercan a estas tortas !!!!
My family comes here for special occasions and holidays so we do not have to worry about cooking .
I 'd never call something gross , but his fish was vertically near that .
This pad thai is something i have never tasted before .
Definitely not worth the price we paid .
They do not have crab legs here , which kinda sucks , but imagine how much profit they could make off of that .
The sushi is not half that bad for buffets either .
It would not hurt to have different choices of fruit or putting out a little less gruesome looking oysters .
No matter what though , tokyo will still be my family 's one stop buffet until a better one opens up around the area .
The meat was cooked decently but all together the dish is not worth what you get .
Not much people know about it , but does it attract people from all around .
I do not blame them taking that trip to taste their delicious subs .
I am not a big fan of their pizza , but i will eat their subs daily if i could .
I wish i could substitute the chips with something like a salad or something , but i am not going to complain .
I have been here multiple times and every time they can not figure out how get an order correct .
Food was not good , price extremely high , insult to the injury there was mandatory 15 percent gratitude for no service .
But , considering that i love the whole idea of tapas and we probably sampled 9 - 10 items , pretty good is not enough to make me go back .
We specifically told our server that we needed to be out of there by 10 pm , and i felt like she did not really care whether or not we were out by 10 pm .
Not so sure if i 'd come back here again .
Maybe for a snack before / after shopping , but never again for dinner - especially when i plan on going someplace else after .
I would not go out of my way to visit this place agin .
I was not very impressed with the pianist and their lyrical abilities .
The bar on the right was way crowded and not staffed accordingly .
The bar up top on the left was not even staffed .
I heard they do not like to staff the bar on the top left due to customers using the stage as a site seeing balcony and preventing customers from accessing bar .
Who would not adore this idea ?!
I really could not say anything bad about this place .
I have been coming here for about 4 years and never have had a bad meal .
The last time i was here was in october and it just was not up to par with the last times i have had it :/ but today at lunch was the last straw .
I have had sesame chicken 4 times there and it was not .
But i am never going back after the waiter was trying to take advantage of me .
I went in to place my order since it was the first time i had ordered from them and honestly the inside did not impress me , in fact it made me a little worried even .
With that said i do not know that i would take the time to go in and eat but i will probably be ordering to go from here a lot in the future .
I think next time i will get light on the sauce as i am not a huge fan of sauce but it was exactly what i was looking for .
I also ordered the mozzarella sticks which were just frozen and fried , do not know that i will get those again but the pizza i will for sure !
Did not measure but looked like 14 - 16 " .
At half , wanted more but did not want to spoil the enjoyment .
Food was not mind blowing or even anything spectacular but it hit the spot .
I give it a 3 but that , to me , is not a ' bad ' 3 , while it was good , it was not anything eggceptionally out of the ordinary ( see what i did there !? )
Sitting for 20 min and still had not placed an order .
We will never ever eat at this place again .
One friend actually said , " worst decision ever . " always remember kids : never doubt the 100 pound girl that eats like a 300 pound man .
House of pizza is not the fanciest of places .
I had veggie kabob , it was delicious and not expensive , thank u
The therapist talked to me before the massage started about areas i may or may not want addressed , the intensity of her massage , and the temperature of the stones .
Was not expecting much so i was pleasantly surprised .
I 'd never admit this to anyone but you , internet .
I drink at the dog bar and never bring my own dog .
I simply can not imagine a more perfect mixture : beer and friendly dogs .
I honestly believe that if this place had better beer to offer than budmiller domestic light lagers , i 'd never go anywhere else .
But since they do not , it 's usually a fun alternative after we get bored at another , lesser , more human - dominated bar in the noda vicinity .
I spent about 100 on drinks for the two of us but we never really caught a buzz .
We waited about 30 minutes to be seated ... no biggie ... waited another 30 minutes for the food only to have the wrong order brought to us .
I feel a need to point out that the dynamic i observed with the employees indicates management issues and not necessarily an issue with the staff .
And each time i tried to purchase 14 jelly filled donuts with no success .
I have visited this place a few times before but will no longer be returning .
The only reason i give one star is because there is not an option for none !
First , as many people have already stated , there are no requirements that must be met for dogs allowed in the place .
Here .... that does not exist .
And secondly , the reason i have no desire whatsoever to return , is the staff .
Rather than discuss that with me in an apologetic way , i was handed a handful of cash with no explanation .
I tried to get some explanations from the bartender and told her i did not order the pitcher .
So she would not take it off .
So to sum things up , if you choose to visit this place .... do not expect anything awesome and pay in cash so your card will not be charged by " accident " and for items that you do not order .
The beer selection is not bad at all , good enough to please the dog owners .
Friendly staff and it 's clean even though it 's not in the best part of town .
Go to kabob express on the corner of tropicana and eastern instead , it 's not that much further .
It looks gross from outside - really no frills , under a creepy walkway , across from an abandoned store .
The inside was no better .
We moved several times and could not find a table without remnants of food , rice and dirt .
It is definitely not up to health codes by anybody 's standards .
Is making an extra dollar off a plastic water bottle that important to your business that you can not properly serve your paying customers ?
There was not even a good amount of salad but it was all drenched in a greasy cheap italian - like dressing .
Do not ever go here .
It feels like anyone can come and kill you and no one would hear you scream .
However when we got there we saw a server out front rushing inside with a cigarette ... she put it out in the dirt and left it on the brick ledge by the door ... i popped out to go inside and the smell of smoke was so strong i told my family not to even get out of the car .
We will not be returning .
No on sight management the most depressing music on earth .
If you are expecting it to be something it is not then you will likely be disappointed .
Buffets are a no no , unless its $ 40 pp .
I am not a germaphobe but fahgetaboutit .
If your not fussy about quality the huge variety is there to stuff yourself .
Drinks were not too pricey .
It 's not fancy and sometimes it can be a little ghetto depending on the folks inside but the food is good and the service excellent .
The breakfast that we ordered ( eggstravagnaza , steak and eggs , i can not remember the other ... ) was so filling .
Amending this due to both my moms boyfriend and i getting food poisoning that i am still dealing with 36 hrs later :( will definitely not be back .
Did not notice until i was leaving sanitation score was 90 , not saying that is why the food poisoning occurred but generally i do nt eat at places below a 93 .
I can not go more than three .
It feels like you are walking into a restaurant that has not changed a lot over the years .
Their pizza is not the best in charlotte , but it 's very solid .
I do not get down this way much but when i do this will be on my short list .
Just do not call domino 's - they mess up your order every time .
The only thing i did not like the way the hash browns were made .
Not sure .
They are not greedy in regards to coffee .
I am from northern virginia and maybe i am not used to people being nice or maybe the service at evolve is phenomenal ..
Creative drinks that do not disappoint !
I have never had bad service at waffle house until yesterday at this location .
It started with us having to ask for coffee not being offered a drink when we sat down not even water .
T=too greasy and just not loved enough .
Anyways for a bill of 50 for two was nt a cherry on top either price was for the location yes it was expected , but being hopeful for a great brunch and not having it was just a nil situation .
Not coming back again . =(
Last time we went we fasted all day in preparation because the food is too amazing to not try one of everything .
I am usually pretty hesitant to eat raw fish from a buffet ( seems like a bad combination ) but i have not had any negative effects here .
There is a live band i am not sure how they pick the songs they sing , but i started making requests as the night went along .
There was one bar tender i liked and she made the drinks strong i do not remember her name , but she had black hair .
Do not waste your money .
Believe it or not with all that the people are relaxed , friendly and the waitresses are great too .
My most recent experience , a friday evening , was not as fun .
To be honest , on of the performers was not that good of a singer , and we could hardly hear her - even with a microphone .
Arrived on time , and they had no record of my order .
I showed them where i had called and they said i would have to wait again because they had no record of the order .
Not even an apology .
Other people 's food looked good - too bad they did not want to serve me .
This was probably the least expensive great restaurant i went to in vegas ( ok we are not counting in - n- out cause that place rocks for $ 6 ) .
If that does not cure a hangover , i do not know what does .
Ok i guess i have one negative thing to say , but it still will not change my rating .. the sangria pitcher is on the small side .
( now there 's a shocker . ) if you are not a dog person , it might not be the place because the dogs do want to say hello .
The patrons and staff are friendly and easy going , very diverse crowd , there is no cool factor , thus making it a very cool bar .
Thank you .. can not wait to return !
In a bizarre turn of events , not one of the 6 people at our table ordered pizza in this supposed house of pizza .
Apparently our friends who brought us here have never even tried their pizza and they used to frequently order from this place when they lived nearby .
There was no burnt edges , just perfectly cooked as promised .
Why do not italian places offer a lasagna sandwich ?
Figured what the hell , have not done the bud heavy in years .
The food quality and portions suck , i would not mind if i left there satisfied .
I had the first smoothie on the list .. can not recall name .
But really good , my meal did not have a greasy feel .
I came off season monday am at 11 am ... not every crowded so seating was very easy .
Plus it was 5 min walk from my hotel ... can not argue with that .
When they missed an item from our order , it was taken off no questions asked .
The place looks like a dump from outside - like a fast food restaurant and the food is not much better .
I did not mind this as movie theater nachos are actually quite yummy , but this i not regal cinemas - i wanted mexican nachos .
The flautas had minimal flavor ( if my wife were writing she would say no flavor whatsoever ) and were extremely dry .
Needless to say i will not be returning .
I do not say this about just any place i have been unimpressed with , but i actually regret having gone to tortas paquime .
It takes about 10 minutes , even when not busy , to receive the order .
I did not give it 5 stars because the lighting on the inside is very dark ...
The ac was not working the employees were all sweating .
It does not make sense for a mediterranean restaurant to serve plastic cheap utensils with hard to cut kabobs .
I will never go back !!!
Maybe i was not drunk enough .
But hanging with work friends and mumbeling song i had no idea about was fun .
Small breeds beware you will have to constantly watch your dog not to get stepped on by the bigger dogs .
Maybe one day they will have an area for small dogs and i can relax and not worry about my dog .
Can not wait to return .
Yes it is the 24 ice festival but the bar area was totally a no go .
No bar tender , no menu , no service .
Not a happy customer
I say benedict - style because it was not plain old hollandaise on there , but something they called romanoff sauce .
Not as magical as the rhapsody dish , but certainly a big step up from a breakfast sandwich at dunkin donuts .
I hope they make it to massachusetts at some point , because ihop just does not cut it compared to this place .
I selected the " custom " facial online but was not given any options for customization when i got there .
No smile .
No checking back .
The gazpacho was good but not extraordinary and to my surprise , the waiter did not even know what kind of olives i was being served .
They do not serve food but you can order food or bring it in and eat there .
I am updating the below review after eating there tonight and being mortified in finding out they have changed their beans as of last week to include meat which means there are now no good vegan protein options !
The chips , salsa , and veg tacos ate still good but there is no well rounded meal option left and we will have to give up what was one of our favorite places to eat .
I am not a big fan of buffets , however , if you are with a family or group and on a budget , this is great value for your money !
I cleaned my seat since it was not done .
I am not a fan !
Here one reason why i am not a fan .... some of the food is old ( for the food items that a lot of people do not get ) and cold .
Here one reason why i am not a fan .... some of the food is old ( for the food items that a lot of people do not get ) and cold .
No oysters or crab legs .
This place is in the ghetttooo and food is not memorable in the least so i do nt think i m coming back .
It is not fine dining or a hipster modern menu , but an old school italian restaurant classic to the style of the southern states .
( not bad at all , but not awesome ) third is that this is a local restaurant , and not a chain .
I felt more treated like a person and not just another customer .
I was not overly impressed with the food , but it is good .
I would come back and try some of the pasta dishes , but would not make this my go to spot .
I thought it was decent but my wife was not a fan at all .
They have a bar and a decent bottled beer lineup , but no beer on tap ... at all ...
They have bands come in and play , but they are not the most personable ever .
I had to look out side and make sure i was not at a jimmy johns .
Anyways , this bar is not made for my tiny terror ... but it is still one of my favorite spots to grab a beer .
I will definitely be returning in the near future .. this is not your typical chinese buffet !!
I guess she thought i was stupid and that i would not notice .
Do the job right the first time and you will not have to do it twice .
I guess she did not think i would notice that she did not even take out any ice .
I have never experienced such bad customer service until i stepped into waffle house and met audrey .
The food was good but if i was not craving waffles , we would have left .
When driving by and looking to park saw a gentleman and his two boys entering ... 4 minutes or so later we entered and there was no - one at the front reception area except for the man i had seen enter a few minutes earlier ..
We waited another 2 minutes and enough was enough .. we left never ever to return ..
The staff behind the counter / kitchen saw us there waiting ... no one came ... the place had 3 tables occupied at most ... what a waste of effort ... mr. i m never going back there
You can not beat the price .
Our dishes were fantastic and did not take long at all to bring out .
Each of our dishes came with a side of rice of our choice but no egg rolls .
I had honey walnut chicken , came out hot and could tell was made with love and not thrown together carelessly , which was fantastic .
But you may end up with a larger bill than expected , so this may not necessarily be a place to go to every weekend but more a once in a while type place .
This still have the best hash browns no matter the time of day .
I do not mind waiting if they are in a rush , but i do not understand why it would take so long when there were hardly any orders .
Also , i found it strange that they do not include coffee with the breakfast when all their competitors do .
I am not sure what it was but the morning i stopped in here i was not too hungry , i was just craving a crepe with nutella .
This place is a little bit on the outskirts of old montreal which was nice because it was not crowded like all of the other places were on a nice weekend morning .
The wait staff was attentive and friendly and had no problem dealing with my obnoxious group of half english speaking , half french speaking friends .
I like the fact that it 's walking distance from the hotel i normally stay at , it 's not too crowded , and it has a very diverse menu , so i would probably return here again .
It is not a pita bread , but the menu says persian bread and it s like a flatbread .
Falafel was on top of this bread becuase it was not a pita so that was different .
A very good falafel in a town of pretenders and it s not even all abiout the falafel .
That 's not the bad part , she tried to hurry and put the order in .
I had to tell her that we would rather not wait .
I love places kike this when it comes to pizza .. cozy , not expensive and family owned where you feel welcomed .
When this location first opened they had great fast service , now not so much .
When i did not finish my meal , he came by to ask if i had any feedback .
I will never ever eat at this place ..
I did not know japanese restaurants serve pizza and texas toast along with mexican foods .. smh
What 's not to like ?
Sure , sometimes it 's a lil greasy but , it 's not as bad as some and in a 24 hour breakfast joint like this , a lil grease is to be expected . this location is a lil newer and cleaner than the average waffle house .
They make up food that 's just as good as all the others ... my typical orders are the biscuits and gravy , grilled chicken sandwich or various breakfast combos ( but never the waffle - do not go there ) .
They have a pretty good salad , if you are ever in an no - grease mood while at waffle house .
But the place is clean and seats hundreds ... usually no wait timw .
First time to waffle house and we were not disappointed .
The employees at house of hunan , however , do not .
When my friends and i arrived at the restaurant , we were not greeted , although there was a middle - aged man ( i assumed it was the same man i spoke with on the phone ) and a twenty - something year old girl standing at the hostess desk .... doing nothing .
After a few moments of them fumbling around and telling me to " hold on , " i was informed that they had no record of my reservation .
They were not accommodating , they offered no explanation as to why my reservation did not exist , and told us they had no room for us for " at least an hour , probably longer . " needless to say , we left still hungry , and i vowed to never return .

I spent the night singing loudly along with every song and continuously requesting songs that i had not heard in awhile .
The musicians are very talented , but i would not recommend coming if you are not ready to sing along and enjoy the music .
I do not think this is a " regular " spot for most people , but definitely worth visiting every once and a while .
Very unorganized never have anything in stock .
She was also totally hilarious and had me cracking up the entire appointment - i am not usually one for talking during my appointments , but julie made me feel like i was just spending the hour catching up with an old friend .
Unfortunately , my milo is still " intact " & will not ever be able to partake in the fun here .
The atmosphere is very casual & not pretentious .
The sauce has no flavor at all .
I would take a bite and have to double check to see if there was sauce on it because you can not taste it !
I tried to add ketchup to them , but did not help .
They have an amazing menu full of different combinations and meats and exotic foods i have never heard of .
However , when ordering the owner , or atleast what i presume to be the owner , talked me up to getting the lamb kabob plate , with no fee !
This was amazing because lamb is much more expensive on the menu , $ 6.99 chicken vs $ 8.99 lamb , i did not complain and happily took the upgrade .
The salad was lackluster at best but that was so minimal that it did not hinder my dining experince .
I will ignore the somewhat high cost , because for vegas , it was not that overwhelming .
Three times a waiter / busboy came to our table and laid down a dish that was not ours .
They finally wrangled the pizza , which they comp 'd after we said we did not want it at all .
If there were staff issues , etc. , going on , we did not know about it , as no manager fessed up .
Best caesar salad ( grilled ) ever ... but it 's a crime not to try the lasagna ( try adding mushrooms ) .
This time , not the case !
The chicken was over cooked and was not seasoned at all !
The rice also was not great and super plain !
I was def not impressed : (
No more half price sushi .
Not to worry , they still have tasty happy hour specials and their food really is worth the full price .
Be sure to ask about their specialty rolls .. the ones not listed on the menu .
I know that you do not go to waffle house for the service , but i would never recommend this place to anyone .
There are not a lot of cheap restaurant options in the old port , more specifically and in the legal district .
However , sometimes the waitresses make mistakes on your order ( " no i asked for white bread , not whole wheat " ) .
Pretty standard and not very difficult .
It was not fantastic , but tolerable .
The price : $ 10 ( because tea is not included with breakfast ) .
Skip it , unless there is no other option .
Even as we pulled up , my friend and i kind of gave each other a look like " are we sure about this ? " but do not let the outside discourage you !
With all of the amazing options on the buffet it would be hard to leave this place and not feel like you got your money 's worth .
The food was fine , but not worth the 40 minutes it took to come out once we placed our order .
My omelette was good , though not " eggceptional " .
I can not say enough good things about her .
But that 's not enough ...
I will not criticize the latter reviews , because i am the kind of germophobe who will not put her purse on the kitchen table , and i take my shoes off when i am indoors because i think , " eww ... think about where they have walked ! " all this to say that i get the folks who are less - enamored of the dog bar than i might be , and i get their reasons .
The dog bar does not serve food , but on weekends and for special events , they often have food trucks in their parking lot , or you can get carryout from other restaurants in the area .
Yes , dogs had recently lounged on the bar , but our food was protected by a styrofoam barrier , and we took care not to lick the tables .
I was not sitting on the astroturf , so i was no more bothered by walking on cleaned areas where dogs had peed or pooped than i would be at home in my yard .
The most important reviewer of our experience at the dog bar can not type .
If you have a dog , or if you do not but you love dogs , the dog bar is a great place for them to hang out .
The dog bar is one of charlotte 's most unique experiences , and i loved going and can not wait to go back !
It is really great for not just the dogs but the humans too !
99 % of the people i have encountered here are great except you do sometimes get people who openly admit to not liking dogs and then get mad when one of them jumps on them , uh hello it s a dog bar do not come in if you can not deal with that !!
There are simply not enough words to describe how delicious the food is at novanta .
From appetizers to drink to entrees to desserts you just will not get better service or food than novanta .
It is a generous serving size and looks like you will never be able to finish it after a delicious meal , but it is so light , before long you have eaten the whole desert .
I have not had their pizzas , but i have had their veggie lasagna and a few other pasta dishes .
They are always delicious , but not date - night , wearing your stilettos delicious .
Inside is beautiful but literally last 3 times i came here no one was manning the register .
We went to get food and they clearly did not have enough .
Not enough at all .
Then the tickets you could only use drinks under $ 7.25 ... when you add it all up , was not at all worth the money .
Also , they really did not duel like i have seen at many other dueling piano bars .
Needless to say we will not be returning .
I eat there at least twice a week & i am still not tired of it & do not think i will ever be !
During that time , it 's hardly anyone there ( not the best breakfast time i guess ) .
Some clarification -- it seems to me that the people who have poorly reviewed this place do not understand the purpose of it .
It 's not a starbucks , it 's not a workspace , it 's not your local pub ...
If dogs are not your thing or if you get uptight with dogs playing , running , and barking then this is not the place for you .
You are not even bussy , i am looking at the donuts as we speak , we just want a dicen ..!
No wonder you have 2 stars out of 66 coments .!
Never to come back .!
Sauce you can see , but not taste .
The service was awesome ( despite the two women working being a little overwhelmed by the never ending lunch crowd ) , the prices were decent , and the decor was bad ass ... but the pizza , as advertised for on their huge , often - bur nt - out neon piece dangling over central , was pretty bad .
No herbs , pepper , salt .
The service has not gotten better in the drive - thru or walk - in .
I really wanted to like this place because it seemed like a convenient location , but i can not recommend it .
Not crazy about location but food is worth it .
I love chinese food and buffets ... this place is not bad , but not great either ... the good : pepper steak , hot and sour soup , sushi , bbq ribs , fried sauteed shrimp , fried squid ... they may have the best carbonated drinks of all chinese buffets ( enough fizz and mix of syrup ) ... the bad : the fried rice ( absolutely no or bland taste ) ... how hard can it be to get this right ... fried crab ( just too small , is not it illegal to catch and sell miniture crabs ... does not it have to be a certain size ... where is peta on this ) ... the crawfish ( it s the sauce that 's the problem , too thick , slimey ) ... the fried chicken was too fried ( was not moist , just dry ) ... the servers ( some male servers somewhat arrogant ) ... i must have been there at most five times since it opened ... have not been there in a while ... just better choices out there ... up the block :)
Not shocked this place closed .
Actually they said it was paella , and i ordered paella , but i have never had what they call paella .
It sure did not match what i know as paella and what they even showed on their website .
I had previously been twice with friends and i was not too impressed with the food and thought the service was a bit slow .
Recently i have been twice and now this place is one of few restaurants anywhere that i will never ever go back to .
My girlfriend , who i gave the dolmeh to , said that there was a weird red sauce in the dolmeh she had not seen before and she thought maybe the tomatoes were bad quality and dyed red .
I got my groupon out and he said that i could not use it for take out , it was dine - in only .
So , long story short , the people who are here are trying to drum up business by partnering with groupon , yelp , restaurant.com and then when the customers arrive they are being charged more up front for many menu items , possibly being restricted to dining - in only when that 's not stated ahead of time , and then being charged gratuity on top of everything , possibly even for take - out ( if they allow it ! ) .
Can not wait to go back !
I am reading here , i would have thought that this was a good place to go for a couple of beers .... not so much .
Parking in noda is a bit of a problem when you do not know the area well so the open spot in front of the sign proclaiming that only patron 's of the dog bar could park there or be booted ( i am no fan of the boot ! )
The bartender was a loud and boisterous soul ( which i have no problem with as long as you are getting your work done ) .
I finished my beer , during which time i found out that she was having decidedly too little sex with her not - a-real boyfriend , ( just a fwb ) , watching her drop a case of beer on the floor and other fun stuff .
I even made eye contact and yet at that time she was not ready to finish her role as talking person and it sat .
No says i and i hand her a $ 20 to pay my 2 cups of beer .
Not a good performance by a long shot .
I feel no need to ever go back and really rue the fact that i did not take the time to get out faster and try another joint .
V- dub eat and drink well , my friends , just not here .
Anyone that thinks this place serves good gyros , has never had good gyros and needs to have their head examined ..
Half a pita with something that looks like steak - ums does not a gyro make .
I do not know what kind of meat that was , but it was not gyro meat .
And when someone asks for fries to be boxed separately , do not just put them in the styro containers smaller compartment , box them separately !
The cashier or manager or whatever was friendly but that does not make me ever want to go back in there ..
Um , no thanks .
I 'd like to give another 5 stars to the woman at the desk ( whose name i did not get ) , she was also a welcome kind soul .
When you are from out of town , you never know what you are getting at a spa you have never been to , and today i was a very lucky customer .
Food is great for the price and made fresh , not sure about the meat to me meat fresh is just butchered , i like to get the lamb .
It has a family owned feel to it ( i think it is , not sure )
In all my years i have never seen a restaurant this poorly ran .
There were no other customers in the establishment however there were at least 10 employees standing around talking .
The staff acted as if we were not there they were either on cell phones making person calls or screaming at each other from opposite ends of the store .
Wait - how have i lived in charlotte for 3 years and not known about this little gem ?!
But do not eat here because pretty dirty floors & all the tables are dirty & we are the only customers in this place .
I usually do not waste my time with chain restaurants , but i have heard a lot of raves about dunkin ' donuts coffee - when this location sprung up near me , i hurried over to try it .
We first went for a winchell cuz that 's her favorit but they had no chocolate bars .
Such names lets just say i was kinda excited but that did not last to long when i look inside the bag and my order was just tossed in there like trash .
She also did not massage my abdominals , which too many massage therapists skip .
Who would not loves tapas !
That was delicious , included some fresh chopped apple / orange / lemon , very refreshing , but not sure it was worth $ 15 for half a pitcher .
The bread they served with the meal was also delicious , but they gave such a small basket , they could not refill it fast enough for us ( nor for our ice water ) !
The crust was thin and crispy and the pizza itself was pretty huge ( could not finish it ) , but the oil from the cheese and meat just gathered in the middle of the plate and my crust soaked it all up .
Unfortunately , the rest of our service was not that great either .
Our waiter never came back for a water refill , and we actually finished eating our food and probably sat around for 5 minutes before flagging down another waitress for our bill .
The carnitas and ribeye tacos are tasty and the tortas are not only good but are enormous as well .
You never walk away from tortas paquime hungry but leave some room for a dessert because the ice cream and pastries will satisfy your sweet tooth .
Great service and excellent food , it does not get any better .
House of pizza is not closed !.
As for the food ... i have never had the pizza , or the lasagna , but the salads are large and good but the one thing that keeps me coming back , time after time are the subs .
I can not wait to have one again .
You might be surprised ... no not really ... i hate piano bars .
If it is staged to embarrass people ... not so great .
Never really had to wait for a drink .
Overall - despite the fact that i dislike piano bars and the place did not have the same cozy feel that i prefer of say a mr smith 's in dc , i had a good time .
The girl singing was not even able to carry a tune , i think it was almost started bleeding it was so bad .
Wow , tapas in vegas has not disappointed me !
The scallop were also very good as were the peppers ( not that spicy ! ) .
The ambulance got ready to leave and the staff ran over to the table that the guy had eaten at , grabbed the bill and ran out the door after the ambulance because the bill was not paid .
Not empathy at all .
No one in our section left a tip .
Nori that 's not rubber , perfect rice , spice that accents rather than overwhelming the fish ... the love boat for 4 - 6 plus one large roll filled the four of us amply .
The green tea ice cream was delicious and portioned so large that two of us could not finish .
I was not one of them .
The cooked food , not so good , and still overpriced .
Too bad they no longer have half price sushi tuesdays or a happy hour - a 50/50 shot at good food and service was worth the gamble then , but we no longer patronize this place .
It was at this point that we decided we were not going to be in the mood for a full meal so we asked the waitress / bartender if we could use the restaurant.com certificate for the sangria and appetizers .
Not a problem said my now much more efficient waitress .
I went with friends - i will never go again for the taste and price to me not worth it .
The taste of the food was just not that great .
If it was not for my friend who read the poster above the urinal in the restroom , we would have never knew !
Wish our waiter told us ... but i guess that 's no reason to give this review any less , because the food here is delicious ...
It was so disgusting , not to mention she is lucky she did not break a tooth .
We could not even bring ourselves to finish the meal we had ordered .
The hostess ( white male ) simple said " oh yeah , the cooks clean the woks after every order with a stainless steel brush and that happens sometimes . " not so much as even an apology .
I was not expecting anything out of this ordeal other than an apology and making sure it does not happen to some other poor person who may actually break their tooth ... ok so bad to the sushi that i ordered today ... by far the worst sushi i have ever eaten ( and come on it 's a freaking avocado and california roll , how hard is that to mess up ?!?! )
I just moved back from columbus where i are sushi all of the time and they never charged for this and i always had amazing sushi which was also not as pricey . ) then they jammed a bunch of nasty pickled ginger in the to go container so the entire row that was next to it tastes like disgusting pickled ginger .
I do not think i can bring myself to spend another dollar there again .
No thanks !
It 's waffle house so i do not expect it to be fancy .
It 's not like they are striving for a michelin star for heaven 's sake , of course it is going to take them more than a day to work out the kinks .
I certainly hope that these over zealous and over critical reviewers ( how about we come review you at work ! ) do not scare off would - be customers of this establishment or potential , future restaurateurs of which our town is in great need of !
The only thing is i wish there was a shower and place to really relax afterwards - but that seems like something they do not do in pittsburgh .
Today , i received no coffee at all .
I stood and stood and stood there waiting to order , but they never even approached me .
I honestly think they are racist , and did not want to help a white man .
She was told they " take phone off the hook or do not answer during busy hours " .... she got cursed out by a young man in the parking lot as he tried exiting the lot .... and was cursed and felt threatened and fearful for her safety .... the food was cold when she got it home only a mile away ...... i have eaten at the place since i was a child but it appears the thrill is gone ..... pizza peel less than a mile away seems a better option and more importantly a safe one .
This place is the quintessential hole in the wall restaurant that you always heard about but never been to before .
Do n't do that again !!!
But this is not why the score it low , it was the flavor to value ratio.
I had not yet found a really good pizza parlor in charlotte in four years of living here , but i think i just did yesterday .
They did not skimp on the dressing like more frou frou restaurants and the lettuce was still crisp ; check 2 .
The prices are reasonable , and if you book your next massage ( not sure about any of the other services ) right after your appointment , you will get 10 percent off , and 15 off the next time .
Does not matter if the delay is caused by a persnickety customer , dunkin screwed up , or the customer ordered way too much for the drive through ( like those that special order for their entire office ) ... get them off to the side .
I went there several times and have been convinced they do not care about the health of their dog guests at all .
First of all , though there is a sign on the gate that requires the dogs to vaccinated , no one is there to enforce or check .
In fact owners or management never checked to see if the dogs have the correct vaccinations .
They did not replace the water and they did not ask the owner of the dog to leave or even identify the owner to get it to stop .
Obviously the owners and managers of this place do not care about the health of the animals or people that fund this establishment .
I will never be taking my dog there to say the least .
My boyfriend and i have never been to this type of restuarant before , so we were not sure what to order .
I have never had it before so i do not have much comparison but it was very good .
As for the meat dish , it was not very good .... that 's why i do not remember what it was called .
As for the meat dish , it was not very good .... that 's why i do not remember what it was called .
My boyfriend said it was something his mom can make ( hehe ...apparently his mom can not cook ) .
I had never been to waffle house before today and i was pleasantly surprised .
It may not be asthetically pleasing and pretty sure one the patrons who looked like a waffle house regular farted right next to us , but the food and the service was pretty good !
You may not visit them very often , but you are always glad to know that they are there .
Their size is not on the big side .
The bathrooms did not have paper towels .
It did not taste like steak , but more like a processed meat .
I added caramelized onions were not caramelized at all .
So i do not know why they would call it that .
It was not crunchy , it was more soggy if that .
Her name is audrey and she obviously does not posses basic customer service skill .
Not to mention the caprese app was so great .
Now i am not too keen on chinese buffets , but when you are a broke college student this will suffice .
Great lunch deal with student discount ( i think it 's $ 8 ? ) and dinner 's deal is not bad either ( $ 11 if i am not mistaken ) .
I will never go anywhere else .
It does not get much better as far as skincare lines go .
There is little to no space for walkways and the place tends to get very clogged on crowded nights .
This place , and the rest of the epicentre , is a tourist trap and only for people that do not live in charlotte .
Have not tried the sandwiches but they are on my list .
It does not take that long to get it fixed ... can only imagine how much money they are losing .
I always order the vegetable steamed dumplings and for my main meal i order the seafood nest with no potato basket !
I was a little disappointed i was not offered any refreshment before beginning my treatments but that 's a small thing .
I am sure they did not care but i felt a little self conscious .
Not bad but not great .
She did not ask about problem areas or things i wanted to focus on .
She did good work on my shoulder blades but i honestly was not happy with the way she scratched my scalp ( ! ) for what felt like a long time .
What i was not told was they would upcharge me for the polish removal .
Look i would have said yes and paid it but i did not like only being told at the end of the service .
Definitely not conducive to a relaxing or pampering experience .
The pizza is a 9 for me , but wife gave it a 9 - 10 ( she 's not very specific at times ) .
The biggest one is that the chairs are not comfortable .
Another minor negative is that the gelato does not taste like gelato and much more like vanilla bean ice cream ( if you order vanilla ) .
This is a good deal for an individual , but it can add up for a family or group because it 's not like going to a traditional pizza shop and ordering a pie that several people can share .
It was not super busy but i felt the service would have been much better if he had a hand .
Not only did our waiter keep our glasses filled , but when he noticed we were running low on sangria , he suggested another half - pitcher .
We had two half - pitchers of the passionfruit sangria and really liked it - we are not normally sangria fans but this one was great !
I would not come here .
We came in and were attended by the cashier , who was not very friendly .
Now , the tacos al pastor we are bland and little to no meat in them .
My husband complained that his torta just tasted like cardboard , almost no flavor .
Not coming back .
They have not bothered to update their signs , so my soup and salad ended up costing me an unexpected $ 20 . yikes !
It does not get any better then this !
I do not eat buffet pizza , because i am a snob , but i have to say the pizza they offered actually looked tempting , which is a huge compliment from me .
Not only do they have the staples you expect ( seseme and gen .
Tso chicken , cheese wantons , egg and spring rolls , etc ) for i went for lunch on a tuesday ( not a special day in my mind ) and they had pot roast , ham roast , several fishes and more premium items , for no additional charge , as well as a sushi bar that rivals the better sushi buffet lunches in town , and a lovely hibachi .
All this for $ 7 at lunch , no drink .
It is negative when dogs feces are not cleaned up and dogs are too rough .
The staff at the dog bar are friendly and it is just a chill place - dog feces are cleaned up by the staff , but really if it is your dog it is your job to take care of it ... they do not serve food here ( sanitary reasons ) , but noda has so many food options there are not issues with finding something delicious .
Get a vodka ( or gin ) with the wasabi cream cheese olives ... or just ask for some olives and skip the alcohol ( although i would not recommend it ) also try a mango mojito ( it 's not on the menu but the owner makes a wicked one ! )
They have a large menu with lots of choices , from pancakes to crepes , to eggs , omelettes , etc ... you will not be disappointed ... my belgian waffle with fresh fruit was awesome ... every bite of fruit was fresh tasting .
The waitress left out one of the items we ordered so we never got it but we did nt get charged for it .
Another dd that can not get a coffee right .
You know , consistency , fast service , and service with a smile ... no , no , and no .
The atmosphere is so great , honestly you do not even realize you are in the middle of shady side .
No on sight management the most depressing music on earth .
I had only had neapolitan style pizza a few times prior so do not have much to compare it to but did like this pizza .
It 's definitely not a " traditional " type of pizza ( with lots of cheese and heavy sauce ) , that many of us are used to , but very delicious .
I would advise that if you try this place , you do not think you are walking into brooklyn south because this is a very different style pizza , it 's straight out of italy .
This is not ny style pizza so do not think you are ordering this .
We could not believe it was not pasta !
We call could not get enough of it .
Unfortunately they do not have desserts until another week or so .
These negative reviews on yelp , did not make sense based on the food we have eaten at their other restaurants .
I do not get these negative reviews on yelp , as that was not our experience .
I think some of these other reviewers have been a bit harsh as this place has not even been opened for 2 weeks .
The only reason why i give this place a 2 star is because the place is nice , but the service was not good .
The girl at the front counter was not friendly at all and did not even offer a smile .
I did not bother to say anything because i do not like to make a huge deal and make someone throw product away and start a whole new drink .
I simply just will not come back here again .
I live in another state now but when i visit charlotte this is one of my must stops and i am never ever disappointed !
Tried this one and i will never return .
I was in line for almost 40 minutes and the girl at the window was not even nice .
We were given a complimentary bucket of some fruity , girly drink that was really good just not my style .
I mention this because there was another bachelorette party there and they did not get asked to come on stage lol there is a super sweet lady in the bathroom that has all sorts of toiletries that you might need ; gum , deodorant , hairspray etc .
Normally , exciting , crowded , lively , club - like bars are not for me .
The music was fun , the drinks were good and it was actually not too crowded .
First of all this place is not called " waffle house " for no reason , absolutely the best waffles here than i ever had anywhere else ... and i ve had waffles all over the damn place .
The service was the worst any of us experienced and we have wasted more than 2 hours here on what should have not took any longer than an hour because it took so long to get seated , get our drinks , order and get our food , with 30 minute chunks of time from an absent waitress .
The place was busy , but business was no excuse because we saw people who came in later than us get served their food , pay their bill and leave before us .
I had to constantly remind the waitress to bring my ice - cream or utensils because she kept on " forgetting . " the food was ok , but service was worst and have never been treated the way we have by the manager .
The guy who rang me up was very pleasant , not just to me , but to the others who were there .
I got my order and jeeze , i do not remember the meat being this juicy and flavorful .
I came on a thursday night and there was no cover and $ 1 beer ( for a specific type ) .
I do not drink beer , but my friends took advantage of this .
It was not too crowded ... we found some seats by the upper bar .
Not as good as expected .....
Do not know if they have a new chef or cuz of year of the snake celebration , but it was excellent !!!
If i never go here again , it will be too soon .
I paid for a 60 - minute massage , not a petting session .
I do not think that i at all resemble a cat -- if i did , the massage i got would have been appropriate and adequate , but i am not , so i expect to get what i pay for , and was thoroughly displeased .
The food was delicious and cheap , definitely not healthy , but on my budget i can not care today .
Went for mother 's day and was not disappointed , thy handle large crowds well and never ran out of food .
I had 2 very well stacked plates and never got to try everything that looked good .
I am usually not a big fan of buffets , but this is by far the best buffet i have been too .
Still not my to go restaurant but my family loves this place !
But the quality is the food is good , just needs to be heated more and it 's not that greasy either .
Do not let the empty neighboring spots scare you .
They just opened not too long ago , so they are trying to garner some satisfied customers and they are doing a good job of it .
Pizza crust is plain and dull with no crisp or unique anything .
Cheap cheese and no seasoning on the pizza or sauce .
Our experience was not good at all .
The bottom line is we never went back .
In my opinion , the dog bar is not the place for that !
Even when he does not take my requests the dave foley doppelganger piano player has some fun with my snarky comments .
I am not a huge fan of bathroom attendants as i think at this point in my life i have mastered the skill of washing my own hands ... but with that said the guy who mans the bathroom is one of the most entertaining guys to talk to in all of charlotte .
Why not 5 stars ?
If you are not feeling the whole fist pump club thing make sure you check it out .
It s not easy finding cheap eats and drinks on the strip .
I did not really like any of the skewers .
Yesterday they attempted to serve me cold " hot " coffee , and today after being ignored for 3 - 4 minutes , which of course feels like hours , they did not have any dark roast , so i had to wait even longer while they brewed it .
Coffee tastes great however they did not have the almond joy which i get all the time .
I actually could not eat the combination one i got , it was too nasty .
Paellas do not have sauce and they should also have a crust from searing in the pan .
So this is not the greatest italian place in the world , but it 's definitely good .
Did not see anything wrong with them or giving any attitude or poor service .
Service was bad , which i did not expect much but will not be back
The service was " eh. " our waiter was impatient and not friendly .
The restaurant was only a quarter full , so i am not sure why he was so rushed .
Not as crispy as i 'd like it to be .
Do not waste your time or $ $ going to any other asian buffets in the charlotte area .
I have been to sushi only buffets that did not have the selection this place has .
Seriously it is head & shoulders above buffet sushi pretty much anywhere i have ever been aside from perhaps rusan 's ( in atlanta , have never tried rusan 's in charlotte but i hear they also do sushi buffet lunch ) .
It 's clean for a buffet , i do not feel sketched out about the quality or origin of what they serve like some places .
It is also blessedly not full of msg .
I could not eat here if it was .
My husband and i live 45 minutes away but we still would rather go here than anywhere near us because those places suck so much and cost the same or more , we do not want to be disappointed .
I will never go back here again , i will stick to my starbucks thank you .
The pizza is a traditional napoletan pizza which i have never tasted in italy but heard that it is supposed to be softer and slightly higher than the traditional italian pizzas -- thin and crispy .
However , i like the pizza to be thin and crispy but i am not saying this pizza was bad at all , it was great for what style it is and truly lives by it s name - neapolitan pizza !
I will be back for the pasta , from the pictures they look amazing and also there is no garlic used here at all thank you very much !
All the so called " italian " restaurants overload on garlic , that is not italian cooking at all !
If you are vegetarian go eat in a vegetarian place and do not come here complaining about lack of veggie options .
You will not regret it .
Honestly , this little spa in this little house is so warm and inviting i can not wait to go back !
They also have ice cream or gelato ; not sure which one .
I have not tried any of the desserts , but they look tempting .
I did not even know they had pastry on the other side of the restaurant until the second time i came ... lol !
I am actually not much of a sandwich person , but the cubana satisfies me completely .
They offer takeout , but do not answer the telephone .
Get ride of the feature if you can not fulfill it .
Leave that string of restraint at the door and let loose your inner puppy that the humans will not let you do at home .
( no running in the house fido !
It was my first time trying spain food so i did not know portion sizes .
I can not believe i was missing out for so many years .
Word of warning though , it does not include a table reservation !
We especially like this place because it offers a lot of what other charlotte nightlife places do not : seating , and lots of it !
You can come to this place in just a cute top , jeans , and flat shoes , no need to get all gussied up like your 'e going somewhere that thinks it 's more important than it really is !
The dress is pretty casual , no one dresses really " fancy " or " ghetto. " fun fact : if you get the munchies you can order food in from places in the epicenter like libretto's !
Come to find out he had just experimented with some lemon - flavored liquor and strawberry flavored jello and had no idea how they turned out .
I tried the nachos once but i did not like them .
It did not have melted cheese , wth !
Nachos should have melted cheese not shredded .
I do not know if they are always served like that but i would not try them again .
They are not made from concentrate like most places .
They truly taste good , they are super sweet though , but my favorite is the lime one because it 's not as sweet .... but it 's still pretty sweet .
I like the corn in a cup , they do not use canned corn which is a huge plus .
It was so bad that we did not even bother with the paella or the desert .
I would never go back here .
She would not honor what my server stated .
Any other time i would not have blinked twice at the lack of training or inconsistency , but how she talked to me was horrible .
I informed her that i would no longer be coming back and she replied , " fine , ok , do not come back . " not once did she say , he was wrong .
Then he agreed to use a deal and after 5 min of waiting requested $ 6 because the deal could not be used with the special .
Decor is great but styrofoam plates do not meet the same high standard of the food .
In previous visits the service was mediocre and not very welcoming .
Came here on christmas eve and it was not crowded at all .
There were a few dogs fighting that were not really monitored which made me a bit nervous .
We never got a seat or a table but other than that it was good !
Of course you do not expect it to be fancy but it 's cheap good eats .
Everyone gets a free first song suggestion and after that your songs cost money - i am not sure how much .
I have been calling since 7:40 to talk to a manager about what happened and i could not get into contact with anybody .
I email corporate and still have not heard anything back ......
I am a regular and i can not believe this is happening .
You should not bring your attitude to work .... my letter to cooperate was " i went in to your 353295 location yesterday , and i received horrible service .
This one cashier , and he told me there was going to be a wait since there are not any ready .
I did not place an order for one yet because there was not any ready .
Because i did not know if they communicated in the back , or if it belonged to another customer .
" this is not enough icing . " he left to go into the back , and came back with a thick up of icing without a knife .
Dunkindoughnuts does not have a call back system or a way i can leave a message .
No one picked up .
I am a regular , and i can not believe i was treated this way . "
Not to late .
The food was not warm though .
Do not drink the glass soda , it tastes off and they will not exchange it .
The shrimp was not deveined , and cold .
I think they were hoping that no one will notice how bad the food will taste if they sauce the heck out of everything .
It was not better than any take out chinese food .
Our waitress looked like she did not care at all .
We will not be back , ever.
Had great service here but more often than not i had absolutely horrible service here .
I did not enjoy listening to the workers complain about each other .
The food has not always been that good .
My parents went their on valentines day or something and the food was awful , messed up on the order , waited and waited for the food , some nights the food is good other night the food is not .
This place has so much selection it would be hard for even someone picky to not find something .
Sushi bar is amazing i have never seen such a section !
Also had my g/f that night , who 'd never had one .
It 's just that when i want a real - deal torta , it will not be there .
Not all waffle houses are the same , this one always seems a little bit better .
I do not live close by anymore but when i am nearby i would not hesitate to stop by .
Our dirty plates did not pile up , he came by and picked them up every time .
Do not get suckered into the entree dishes that were put there for dumb ass tourists who do not get the tapas thing .
This is not a big place so be prepared to wait , especially if you go during peak times .
Luckily , we went on a friday morning so we did not have to wait , but it was still pretty busy .
They had this crispiness that was quite as crunchy as a french fry , but they were not soft and mushy either .
I was jealous that i did not order one .
They did not have any menus in english when we arrived , but , luckily google translate saved the day .
We sat at the bar and the bartender was not very friendly .
I understand she was the primary person to make drinks and such , so we were not expecting her to hang around and chat it up with us .
First of all , i should mention , i am a huge dog lover & own my own pet care business so i am obviously not phased by dogs playing , barking , pottying , etc .
As you can see from ratings , most of the poor ratings are from people who do not like seeing dogs potty nearby ... do not go to the dog bar if you do not want to see dogs pee / poop .
Other reviews mentioned being " snubbed " because they did not have a dog along .
I would still go to the dog bar if i did not have a dog .
I just can not help it with so many adorable pups around !
The biggest disappointment was that the menus are different and they did not have our favorite tapas ( octopus with potatoes ) .
I suppose it 's just as well since we will never come here again .
Not exactly something i would normally order but good nonetheless .
I would not want my lack of knowledge regarding tortas to cloud my review .
The parking lot is not full of holes anymore , the dining room is much larger and there is actually a separate section for carry out orders .
You will not find a better meal for $ 9 !
On the downside , they have done absolutely zero to update the place - that can either add some major props or knock you a few points , here , we will call it a push , because in charlotte , having at least a couple of things that have not yet been torn down is nice .
When it comes to the staff , they are typically friendly , but not in on overly creepy way , so they make you feel comfortable and welcome , which is all you can ask .
The menu pretty well matches up with the decor , in that it does not look like it has been updated in years , and if it 's good , there is no reason that it should be .
So hot , in fact , that you will burn the roof off your mouth and the cheese will sear your brain so that you can not taste anything for a week .
So step into charlotte 's past ( there are not many places that you can do so ) , give the plate a moment to cool off and relax while you enjoy your dinner .
Either way , there are not many like this around any longer .
They close at 9 pm so there were not many options left which was understandable .
I am not sure if the store front closes early ( like some mcd or starbucks ) .
I also ordered half a dozen donuts ( about $ 6 ) everything came out super quickly ... probably because no one else was in line and the old fashioned glazed donuts were tasty even though they were not fresh .
Waffle house continues to not disappoint .
Although we did not have any dogs , the staff appeared to be friendly and accommodating , and i was impressed at the availability of hoses ( for obvious reasons ) , water bowls and decorative fire hydrants on the large patio .
The beer selection was mostly local brews ( omb , noda , etc. ) and came in plastic cups , so you are definitely not coming here for the brews , but the friendly dogs , patrons and staff are more than enough !
After reading the excellent reviews , i decided to buy the 3 - month membership package -- unlike certain unnamed chain spas , you do not have to pay a membership fee , so if you plan on getting 3 + massages or facials ( or some combo ) , it 's a great deal .
I am not much fussed about atmosphere , but i have to say i was impressed with the high - end feel despite the very reasonable prices .
I live in medina and will not go back .
Walked in a saw a female worker taking drive thru orders , no biggie .
Would not recommend to anyone who 's short on time .
If you live in the charlotte area and you have not tried this place , you are missing out .
No one asked me what i needed .
No explanation was offered jus a " sorry bout that " .
The pizza is actually quite good , but since everything else is not all that great , it deters me from wanting to come eat here .
That said , i have two boxer mixes , who , while not at all aggressive , play rough .
I wish i could go here all the time , but most days it 's just not worth the drama with a rambunctious dog .
Being they allow dogs inside , they do nt serve food , or use glass ( we do not want broken glass shards in puppies paws you know ) , but you can totally bring whatever take out food you want with you .
There is a huge variety of people that show up , from people just coming to play with dogs ( there 's usually more dogs than people ) to the guy that brings his pack of five , young girls that have no clue what to do with their dogs training , the guy that im pretty sure just showed up to hit on girls with puppies , older citizens with their older companions .
I see lots of people just buy sodas too , so do not feel obligated to purchase booze to go to this bar .
If you are visiting ( with or without a dog ) - do not really plan on going anywhere nice after , your clothes could get doggy .
While most dogs are well behaved , that one owner that does not pay attention / who fell behind on training / who thinks it s cute when muddy / drooly fido jumps all over you , will probably show up .
The people with dogs not paying that day already have memberships , do not feel bad about it .
- if your dog is not already trained to listen to you , it s not going to magically happen here .
If you need to sit there and scream at your dog for it to stop and come back to you , your dog is not ready .
You can unleash your dog in the middle of the fences , then let them into the bar so they are not stuck on the leash when the pack of dogs crowds the gate to come greet the new people .
- the bar does not " allow " jumping or humping , so feel free to get the dogs paws off the bar if you do not want it near you , or please break up any humping that may happen , even if it s not your dog .
Also , it s hard to always see your dog , so if another dog poops near you , it 'd be swell if you could scooper it quick so others do not step in it .
I stopped by this new dunkin on my way to work this morning and ended up waiting to order a coffee in the drive - thru for a solid ten minutes and there was no one in front of me .
On top of that , the latte i ordered had no flavor to it .
Not manhattan .
Not even manhattan kansas .
But then you walk in ... and the place is just so nice , stylish , even ... and the mood is good ... and the service is good ... and the food is way good ... and you start thinking you could walk right back outside and the streets would not be full of nascar junkies and hand - to - mouth wage slaves and right wing zealots .
That 's not going to happen .
( although they parked us in the bar , well after our appointed reservation time , gazing longingly at no fewer than three open tables . ) food just so very very very good .
( although i think the waiter took my table mate 's request for " mild spiciness " as my own request ; the hunan trio was very very mild , not the bite that i 'd hoped for . ) the waiter cautioned that my pot stickers would take fifteen minutes ; i have to believe they were not just thawing out during that time , but were actually being hand - made .

Never a bad experience .
It is a buffet and i understand the struggles but i always looked forward to trips here and that just is not the case anymore .
This is not a high class joint .
It s a classic the staff is different but wonderful i have been going to this location once a month for over 8 years the people have changed the feel has not had a chef who made pancakes for my friends little girl we thought the manager would freak out ... no he got the girl crayons and some milk for it
We also love the arancini , and do often share that when we are not in the mood for a salad .
For entrees , you can not go wrong with their pizza .
It 's one of our top favorites in the clt area , as it 's cooked in a wood - fired oven , and is perfectly crispy on the outside - no soggy crust here !
They have a wide array of desserts as well which we did not have a chance to try because we were so full but next time !
The gentleman at the register was awesome enough to have them prepare a batch fresh for me ( so long as i did not mind waiting a little longer for them to prep it ) .
The old house in which it 's located is spacious and walcoming , in no small part to the staff .
No problem .
No problem - they are both professional and very friendly .
They offer a monthly ' club ' plan where you pay $ 59 / month auto - billed on your credit card , and in return you not only get your choice of a 60 minute massage or facial or mani-pedi , you get a standing ' club rate ' of $ 59 for any additional services you buy during the month .
I have never seen a private spa that can compete with the chains with a club like this - please patronize this wonderful local business !
In over 20 years , i have never had a bad meal at any of their locations ( 2 locations also in akron , ohio ) , including this one which is my favorite .
The food not only is always fresh , and has a very balanced flavor , but it is also presented very well , and often has a certain elegance about it .
Ok - friday evening ( 8 pm ish ) and i can understand trying to cut corners on expenses by letting a server go but never cut corners where it counts .
I will not go back to this waffle house again .
Sorry , the management is to blame and since they do not care , why should i return .
I do not fault the dog bar owners for the sickness , but if your dog is susceptible to getting sick easily i do not think it 's a great place to take your dog .
My vet yelled at me because you just can not predict how other people take care of their pets , so just be aware if your dog does not have a strong immune system .
The beer is in plastic cups , but not too pricey .
And they allow you to bring in pizza or any other food into the place since they do not serve any .
I tried to redeem the experience at the las vegas chain and this was not what i expected .
No kids , just couples in the dark and it felt more romantic and sexy .
I certainly do not recommend this place if you are starving !!
It is not that spicy ( to me it is like eating bell peppers but then i love spicy food so i am not the best judge ) , but it is still pointless for me to eat chilies and pay $ 6.95 for that plate .
We filled up on that an a pitcher of sangria between both of us and we were full .... not on the food but on fluids and bread .
Cons : overpriced , not all food that spectacular bottom line : great for after dinner-dates , cocktail only night , girls night to catch up .
Even with available kids menu , i do not think this place will quench their appetities .
There was probably only one tapas dish that i did not particularly care for but for the price ... i would definitely recommend the happy hour and i would definitely go back .
Well it did not disappoint !
Can not wait to be back in the area !
This place is great specially if you are wondering the fashion show mall and you suddenly realize you starving , and you just know the food court is not what you had in mind ...
This place is not where you want to eat !!
No where on the groupon deal does it state 15 % gratuity would be added !!
We asked why he was charging us extra and he stated " because you use groupon , and i no make money !!
Needless to say , we argued and walked out not buying a thing , because we were being scammed !
He can not create his own price adjustments after customers purchase the vouchers !!
Hence , we walked out because we do not trust his business , and we did not want to be taken advantage of !!
2 . the food is not fresh !!
It 's not cheap anyway !
It then reopened after inspection approval ... i found this out after my incident described above ... not being able to eat here was a blessing in disguise , perhaps !
**** it 's unfortunate that this business has potential , but is not putting it to use !!
No one in here .
I had frozen carmel since they had no more chocolate mix , which was my original order .
This is my first visit here and already my impression is that they run out of product , the store is not cleaned regularly and the employees are not held accountable or responsible for their actions or inactions .
It was not a huge deal , but i feel that drinks should at least be consistent .
The real reason for the meh review had to do with a bus person ( or manager ) - i really am not sure who he was .
It would not have been a huge deal but there were four chairs to a small table - top and we would have been packed in like sardines if we kept the table the way he clearly wanted it .
We were not creating any kind of distraction and the chairs were not a hazard the way we had them , he was compulsive about them , it was really strange .
The vocals were not nearly as good , in fact i hate to say it but they were just kind of bad .
All in all i do not think id go again , one dollar drink or not ...
I do not generally eat foods from a buffet but the food is good and the staff is always super friendly !!
I wish we lived closer as i could come back a dozen times & not get the same thing !
Let 's start with little to no parking due to the rental car agency that 's attached to dunkin ' donuts .
For the main course , we could not resist in ordering the chicken paella and also tried the other tapas , like mussels with a caramelized sweet sauce ( absolutely delicious ) .
You may or may not like it , depends on you .
You can not very well try some steaming coffee to see if has the mocha swirl .
( i can not stand seafood , but my mother , whom was with me , would sell her children in a heartbeat if it meant she could eat seafood . )
We went it and we were seated after about 6 mins of waiting not too bad .
Now in canada you are expected to tip , they literally look at you like you are crazy if you do not tip .
I would not recommend this place for chinese food or sushi .
For people who are trying to cut back on their sodium , this is not the place to go .
I asked for a substitute for the rice & they did not even give me a choce for a vegetable or anything else .
That is not very good way for a person who can not eat rice or that much of it , if you are a diabetic or have high blood pressure .
They do not have a private parking lot at all .
I recommend anybody with a well behaved dog to come , or even if you do not have a dog you will have a great time .
Tortas good not the best place is spotless !!
You have to eat here no matter what .
I never tried the food here yet , but did have a couple of donuts and it s exactly as expected .
I have not ever got a great vibe from the managers on duty that are at the front to greet you as you first walk in the door - at least seem a little enthused about being there .
However , do not get too hung up on that as the atmosphere and location are great being right on the square in an older building .
Check this place out , it will not disappoint
When i first arrived i was not sure what to expect because the spa is in an old shadyside house complete with creaky floors and funny drapes .
There were a few dogs fighting that were not really monitored which made me a bit nervous .
There 's a dog bar in lake norman where the staff picks up after the dogs so we do not have to worry about mess .
Not exactly " fast " food as you have to wait longer and nor was the $ 14 price with small drink .
Do not even bother requesting a song .
I had some salty pretzel drink did not taste like alcohol at all .
Definitely not the restaurant for me .
I never write bad review , but the bartender ( female ) on the left side of the bar was the worst i have ever had at any place .
After ordering several beers , she never said thank you or ever hello .
There 's no explanation for her behavior .
Do not go there this place is horrible !
There was no cover charge which was nice .
The pianist themselves were not bad , not great , but not bad .
Coffee is not included with the breakfast dish : 2 eggs and bacon :o !
What breakfast joint in montreal does not have coffee included ( i know that non-quebec places typically price coffee seperately ) ?
Then found another door to a corridor with flickering lights ( i chalk it up to the halloween effects were just not taken down yet ) , and when finally found the sign with a stick figure and a triangle , the bathroom was the scene from basket ball diaries - you can just feel the creepies happening here .
I really needed to pee so bad but not one toilet was unclogged or with toilet paper , since i touched the handle , wanted to wash my hands , but no soap !
So needless to say , i did not use the facilities and just left running ... be sure i purell my whole body after that !
It was obvious they were not smoking cigarettes .
Back to the other and quickly turned and headed into the store exhaling slowly as he was leaving , trying not to be too obvious .
Upon entering the store we noticed about 15 rowdy high school kids bouncing off the walls , with no employees actually working .
I do not live in charlotte , but if i learned stuff like that happened very often , i might have to reconsider !
If you like " old school " pizza and sub joints ( not decorated by some mba , pastel vinyl freak ) , this is your place .
Being a true " child of the south " , i will not try to compare the cheese steaks to anything from where you used to live up north .
Since getting married and moving to the other side of town , i do not get in there as often as i should .
Not a chain , locally owned , good food .
This is not a description of loaded .
For take out , it was not .
Otherwise , you can not go wrong with the new york city roll .
Dani is an awesome server with a dry wit ... do not get butthurt ok
Anyways , i would definitely buy my seaweed wrap from another company , it was a little tough and dry-tasting , which is in no way a knock on the chefs skills .
Everything else could not have been better .
No problem , here i come medina !
It was not until then i realized i did not have my bank card , back to medina i go .
The lovely hostess remembered my face , i will never forget hers either , gave me my card and back home i we nt .
I could not help but sing my senior class song all the way home .
I had to give myself a week to calm down and not leave an ugly review for this place ; it 's been 2 and i am still scarred by my experience here .
Pancakes were burnt and hard , waffles were not even close to moist or soft , even the fruit were sour and not ripe .
Do not order the mimosas , the pulp and cheap champagne did not work .
No servers were ever seen on the floor except when brining out the food so if you needed water or anything else , best of luck to you my friend .
I normally never leave poor reviews because i do not ever want to intentionally hurt a business , but the food and service was so awful that i 'd feel even worse if people actually wasted their time and money here .
If you are looking for a last minute party , this is not the place for you !
It 's not great - not horrible .
A table near us order paella and it looked pretty good and did not last long , so i will try that next time .
... look no further .
I do not know what people are talking about , but the entertainers were great .
I am not sure why people are saying that their drinks are overpriced .
I will be honest when i say that i am not sure what they are individually , but here 's how my evening tab went [ i had a friend visiting that i was picking up the tab from , so do not think that all this is me being a crazy lush ] : 2 incredibly dirty martinis 2 margaritas 3 bahama mama buckets ( cost split between 4 people )
That , coupled with good friends , great entertainment , general hilarity , and the fact that i did not see one person who was not having a rockin ' good time , makes me give this place five stars .
If you are in town and you do not go to howl at the moon you are missing a great time .
The facial was wonderful , although not worth the price .
I am currently pregnant and a prenatal massage was not scheduled as it was a gift .
The girl working the front desk was very rude and basically told me oh well it was my fault and that the massage could not be modified and that i would not receive any money back or any type of credit .
I have heard other people say the food is not as good , i agree .
The bread is not as good as it use to be . high price for a very mediocre sandwich .
The food was not bad at all .
Pita bread and hummus was good , did not find it too oily , although i have heard complaints on that .
He also had us try the green sauce which was not too bad , it had a nice spice to it ( though i had seen it earlier and commented that it looked old ) .
The owner also mentioned that the beef was imported from some country like australia and said it had no hormones .
That i did not believe , this coming from the owner who had already scammed us into buying drinks and gratuity .
I am not normally an iced tea drinker as i prefer more sugary drinks but this was a great blend of flavor and light taste .
It 's true , businesses that run groupons do not make money of those .
Overall , the food was not bad and i would have been up for a return visit , but questionable tactics by ownership has really dampened any chance for that .
I had a horrible experience at dunkin donuts this morning i never had a problem of switching english muffin instead of croissant bread because the croissant bread makes a lot of mess in my vehicle i do not appreciate it so i would rather use english muffin i even told the lady i will pay extra she said no we can not do that at all this is the first dunkin donuts that i was told this nonsense
Not much to the pizza except the crust , and it was burnt .
The food was good , but they do not give you much at all .
Also do not go skimpy on the toppings .
Was also able to sit outside in the middle of february , not bad .
No taste .
Cheese had no taste , very dry and very burnt on the edges after saying we did not want it burnt .
Coffee machines are down , which is not good for a breakfast place .
These ladies do not miss a beat though , service was amazing , food was hot and delicious .
We have experienced discrimination before but not at this level .
Well , natalie , that is not the point .
Normally i love dunkin ' donuts today i bought a regular coffee , croissant sausage and cheese , by 2 pm mostly all the donuts were gone , so i had to settle for one i did not really want then i got some pretzel nuggets which were dark hard dry and cold they were horrible .
Limited beer choices and no food ( because dogs ) but fun atmosphere especially for dog owners with laid back canine kids .
Wish there was no smoking .
Not say it was $ 10.00 which is way over priced for dessert .
This is not thin crust gourmet true italian pizza by any means , but it was delicious !
I have no idea what they put in the crust , but i really liked it .
I was craving a gyro and pizza , but could not decide between the two ...
The only thing that i can say is that it was definitely more of a " fork and knife " kind of pizza -- not a thin foldable slice lol .
Stopped in for a late breakfast , which really meant this was our lunch , i had the classic , my husband got the montréal benny , and we had ordered some poutine since we have never had it in canada before !
I have never been to a dueling piano bar , so i did not really know what to expect .
Sorry chad - they are not offering specials anymore .
Maybe not the greatest musicians , but they clearly knew how to keep the crowd active and they absolutely understood how to make the bucks !
Not just the progressive pricing to get your message written on the mirror , but the subtle plugs for the $ 20 " play it now " requests and the $ 40 " i promise i will not suck if you let me come up on stage and sing " .
Drinks are not cheap and they are hit or miss .
The drink menu does not have prices and the server did not give me an itemized receipt , so i can not even guess at how much they cost .
The three reserved tables did not show up until 9:00 and by that time it was sro .
Walk in and had no clue what i was looking too eat but the cashier was very helpful and i order the lamb and chicken kabob with humus and i loved it .
We ordered : paella stuff mushroom short ribs chocolate cake - on the house for bf food - 5 stars service - 5 stars parking - 5 stars ( plenty of parking spots ) restroom - did not go wait - 5 stars ( no wait , we had reservation )
I recommend this place if you are not picky and have very high expectations for a buffet place .
So it 's definitely not the fastest place to get a coffee since on average the drive thru takes about 10 - 15 mins , but it 's one of the few dunkin locations in the desert .
I still have not ventured off to the breakfast sandwich side , but i know their doughnuts are great .
We all could not say enough wonderful things about this spa & business !!
Great portions - freshly made , no unlv discount and no wi -fi .
Staff and patrons are so friendly not to mention all the great pups !
No microwaves here !
I think the owners are killing it with brooklyn south , but i am not sure they are killing it with novanta
Honestly the sangria at tommy bahama's is much stronger , but this one is nice because you are not getting loaded at 4 pm when you split a pitcher 3 ways .
I would not , however , find this place a good deal at dinner .
The food has always been awesome - not anymore .
Do not let this restaurant go down - it is worth keeping alive - before it 's too late .
I could hear the waitress acting like she did not know what a jacket was .
Will not be coming back
I just can not waste my time driving there to get home and realize once again my order was incorrect again .
It 's not a complicated order at all and they still never get right .
I am not quite sure what taste buds would suggest this was a great place to eat .
Adults not saying " excuse me " while serving themselves and bumping into people .
All around an experience that will not be repeated .
The house of pizza used to be very good , no matter if it was at lunchtime or late at night .
The help stood around talking until i told the gentleman behind me that the reason i was not moving was because of the " wait to be seated " sign .
That got the helps attention although the restaurant did not appear to be busy , maybe 3 tables with people at them .
This chopped meat had little to no flavor and no moisture ... dry as dust .
I never saw her again until she brought the food .
I do not like the red sauce at all .
I have been several times , but it just does not get better unfortunately .
Pizza was okay but not nearly big enough for the price .
Without apps , one pizza would not be enough for me .
Tonight my wife and i decided to try out novanta we were looking for something new in the area that is not a chain .
We decided to eat at the bar which was really nice because the bar faces the windows so you looking out at the christmas tree in langtree and not at a wall of bottles .
So i had the antipasto sushi i do not remember if that is the exact name but it was very good it was mozzarella which they make in house , basil and some meat i was so hungry i do not remember what it was .
Wood fired pizza comes out with a little char it 's not burnt in the least so do not listen to other reviews when they say it 's burnt .
If they think that is burnt they should , d definitely not try coal oven pizza , like frank pepes in ct .
So good food and nice beer selection friendly staff overall i do not think they are going out of business any time soon with that formula .
This is definitely a new destination for dinner out i highly recommend it take the negatives again with a grain of salt i do not know why everyone has to be such an * ^%# % when reviewing somewhere new .
Just ridiculous to take 20 min in the drive thru and have one person i front of me , will not come back here
The only problem was that one of the potatoes on my plate had a big black spot and really should not have been on anybody 's plate , but it was easy enough to push it to the side .
Could not taste anything but burnt crust .
First one was not good but we decided to give it another try ...... just awful .... that is putting it mildly ..... salad was good but pizza was disgusting ..... there was a scant amount of sauce that had no flavor ..... the cheese was cheap tasting and dry ..... the pizza was burned to the point where i was pulling it apart trying to find a morsel that was not blackened to a crisp ...... we complained and the waitress said " oh it looks like you are eating it ! " ...

Just gross .... never will i come back again ..... a pretty place but the worst food !!!!!!!!
Well look no further than uptown charlotte !
Do not know the words to the songs to sing along -- who cares , make something up ! the drinks are a little pricey , but they do have drink specials so it does not have to be a high dollar night .

I will warn you that if you get easily offended or not wanting to sing , have fun and laugh -- i would say skip the piano bar completely .
I can not wait to visit charlotte again in july !
It 's one of those places you 'd never think of going to .
After the waitress took our order multiple times ( she just could not understand what a grilled ham and cheese is . ) after a bit , a few other employees meander in to hang out .
Have not been to one in ages ..
As there are not many in ca.
So , how could i not give it a five ?
No great .
Not horrible , but not really worth the expense .
As someone new to pittsburgh , i am looking for massage and facial experiences that leave no doubt in my mind as to whether they are worth the $ $.
When i go to a spa i like to feel like i am being welcomed into someone 's home and being encouraged to totally relax and be pampered , not just coming in for a service .
No complaints on the sushi rolls .
Could not quite finish those either .
Novonta is not one of them .
The dough is too dense and does not have the proper flavor development .
The handmade mozz was flavorless and i did not like the way it looked when it melted .
Another pizza with spicy salami and hot peppers had a decent flavor , but there was not enough salami .
With all there is to look at in the space , you will never be wishing there was a t.v. to stare at .
As is , i would not recommend .
( ok , i also just could not pass up such a cute name for a dish ... a nest ? ) sure enough , my seafood came in an actual nest made out of fried potato shreds , and the presentation itself made me grin .
The vegetables were rather al dente , which is not my favorite , but i have come to expect it at chinese restaurants .
Our server was not exactly mr .
Warm and fuzzy , but he did his job well , and did not interrupt , so no complaints there .
My first time here and it was not that bad .
I love mediterranean food and i wanted to try something i have not tried before so i went with the lamb n chicken shwarma combo .
Not your typical piano bar stuff , but i guess the crowd tonight had something to do with it .
Big place , not crowded .
The wine - a $ 28 chianti i never heard of was delivered by out waiter who rather ceremoniously set it on the table while trying to crack a joke stating ; " it 's a screw top so it makes it easy to take home " and walked away .
No open and pour , no check to be sure i liked it , nada .
My daughter 's pizza was not at all like i recalled my first visit .
I did not order a diet coke .
Do not serve cut up pizza dough as " bread " - why bother ?
I could have gotten better food , better service and a better overall experience at less money at your other brooklyn south location not to mention competitors like brixx down the street in birkdale .
I go to the waffle shop more times than i should admit but never noticed this place before and am glad i did buy the groupon .
Unlike other spas that i have been to , i was not directed to a women 's locker room to change ( i changed simply where i got my first treatment and put the contents into a bag ) which i thought was unusual but the spa is in a house so i went with it .
Yet , some toppings can not easily be cut with a knife and fork .
For example , the main ingredients of the prosciutto and arugula pizza are layered on after the pizza is removed from the oven , not actually cooked with the pizza .
This is not only hard to eat , but also means the flavors do not really mesh .
I love hanging out with my dog while having a beer , and i love not feeling guilty about leaving said dog at home while having a beer , but i do not like constantly having to untangle my dog from her leash while tied to a table .
Not the cleanest place , and the smell is not pleasant , but , dogs .
Even if you do not bring your dog the entertainment factor of dogs running around playing with each other or laying on the bar is pretty great .
Never gives me a receipt when i ask for it .
The general tso 's chicken is not the best i have had around the cleveland area , but i would definitely recommend the sushi here .
Regardless if there 's a line of cars or not in the drive through the wait is always about the same which is about 10 mins to get your order .
The staff here is decent but not overly friendly or welcoming .
Make sure you are not in a hurry if you decide to stop by this location .
After my first visit to flame kabob , i would not recommend this place .
Next , when i placed my order , the manager argued with me when i asked for a combo with no fries or rice .
I just did not want the carbs , and i did not ask for anything additional .
This simple request seemed to be much - too - much , however ; it did not need to turn into a debate .
Prices were not bad at all for what we ordered .
When i get to play tourist - there are things that i do , that i probably would not do at home .
On this snowy night in charlotte , the place was only half full so there was plenty of room to slide some tables aside and dance to all our favorite songs ( hey - if no one else is going to suggest a song . . . we are not shy ! )
This is a place where audience participation is a must so do not even enter the place if you are not ready to sing along , dance or just bob your drunken head to the music .
This location is on the 3rd floor of the epicenter which is quite the climb if you can not figure out the maze of stairways to get you there .
Not an everyday spot , for sure .
Deserts are not cheap but quite good .
But who does not ?
I was eggspecting this restaurant to eggceed my eggspectations but it did not .
An eggsample of the horrible service was when our waitress did not bring out all our food !!
She did not eggsemplify what you would want in a waitress and we found her to be rude and aloof .
She did not display a sunny side of disposition .
We tried to eggsclude her while we eggsplained the problem to the manager , but the whole thing was scrambled and did not go over easy .
Place is always packed so i must not be the only one who agrees .
She could not even make it to the bathroom .
Id like to hope that the girl was not sick from the food , but not sure what else to think .
I do not think i will be returning .
Love the concept and can not believe places like this do not exist everywhere !
Very social place and i was happy to not see any issues break out between any of the dogs .
Does not serve any food , but there are usually food trucks around , or you can pop into any of the other great restaurants in the area .
But today after a late lunch i decided to go grab a coffee i ordered one large almond joy iced coffee weighted at the window for 10 minutes just for someone to come to the window to collect my money after the lady came and collected the money we sat there for another 5 minutes just to get one coffee there was no one there there was no cars in front of us we were the only car why was the wait so long .
I really enjoy this burrito if you can not tell .
You will not find a better chips and salsa anywhere else !
And all four pizzas had too much sauce and not enough cheese .
All the pizzas needed salt or other seasoning , they had no flavor .
My husband made a comment that people probably go there once to try it but then usually do not go back again .
Fail how do you not have half the stuff on your menu ?
The food was so bad , specifically shish kabob that we could not eat it at all .
I do not recommend this place to any one .
We had to stop ourselves from eating every last bit for fear of not leaving room for our food .
I keep thinking about how she made that hour feel longer than it was because she did not make me feel rushed like some massage therapists can .
I am not sure how i feel about house of pizza now because before i held them to such a high standard .
Now 4 the cons ... they do not cook the food in front of you at your table while you sit .
No fire tricks or tossing food into your mouth .
It s not moist or mouth watering & juicy .
The idea is great , but it s no kabuto !
You do not have 2 wait for your drink to be almost empty or worry about them rushing you by giving you your ticket / check too soon .
Es una tristeza que este lugar ya no se lo mismo en calidad de comida como ase unos años atrás ....
... qué lástima no poder dar una bue na nota ...
I would not order another pizza from here !
The dough was not memorable
Well i am i always feel bad when i yet again leave the house and my little pups sit at the window and wonder why they can not come with .
It 's not in a shady part of town 3 .
I went in with the intention of buying a dozen bagels but could not because there was not enough .
I also wanted to buy two dozen donuts and could only leave with one dozen because there was not enough of the classic donuts .
This is not the first time i have had issues at this location .
This is really not my scene , but if you like that kind of atmosphere , then it 's perfect .
I am not really crazy about the music they play on most occasions .
The sangria was delicious - we ordered a pitcher of the passion fruit and could not stop raving about it .
Can not speak for the paella - none of us like it so we did not order any .
I am still seeing results from it and could not have had a better experience .
We had a fun time watching ross socialize with other dogs , as he never gets a chance to .
Other than the adorable dogs , i can not much about the atmosphere of the dog bar .
I do not know how to spell her name , ( sorry ) .
Not as good as fireflys .
Bill was cheap , and i was in and out in no time !
If you have never been to house of pizza , there 's a good chance you have driven by this place and never even gave it a second thought .
You may walk in and think you do not need a salad .
Since i can not actually live in a house made of pizza , this is the next best thing .
I actually never do but a while back i was double charged for my services .
My husband caught it just in time so i was not overdrawn in my account .
There was no apologies just " oh she made a mistake " . they did offer me 15 % off my next service but after all that i had a bad experience so i did not want to go back .
There was no apologies just " oh she made a mistake " . they did offer me 15 % off my next service but after all that i had a bad experience so i did not want to go back .
I also said i was not coming back to the establishment .
Unfortunately this is not the case .
I have long been curious about grilled romaine and just never got around to doing it myself .
The blanched and peeled tomatoes had a slightly odd mouth - feel to me , i am not a super fan of peeled tomatoes outside of sauce .
I do not think americans are fond of their pizza being 40 - 45 % crust .
And there simply will not be leftovers .
$ 14 for a serving that is exactly right for one person with no leftovers .
This was $ 16 and again , right size for a meal , no leftovers .
I just did not feel like i 'd gotten $ 80 worth of enjoyment for my 30 minutes and i did not get leftovers for the next day .
Stores and restaurants do not always understand that if you charge a lot i will come once , or maybe twice .
This place could be that , but at the current pricing it can not be , is my opinion .
Darius asked a few times during the massage if i was comfortable , but not so many times that it became annoying .
It was not as fruity flavored as other ones i have tried .
Did not care too much for the onions .
I have never seen such dark caramelized onions before .
Sorry not sorry i do not consider a single slice of pizza a meal , especially before a heavy night of drinking .
If they were actually worried about the amount of alcohol per person that math would not add up .
Not sure if the inconsistency makes it worse .
Drinks are a little pricey , but not compared to the rest of the epicentre and cheaper if you average out the night if you include the first drink for a dollar deal .
I mean i can not complain .
Band - no words ...
There was a decent crowd but it was not too crowded , we were able to find a table for 6 easily .
I did not want this dish to end .
I was told the pizza here was delicious , authentic brick oven pizza , but i opted for a can not miss ...
We were seated immediately , and did not wait a full 15 minutes for our food to come .
I wondered why we did not get bread , but i guess they do not offer that here .
I do not bother going for lunch or dinner , however .
Tapas in general are over- priced and i am not into paella .
Not a place i 'd want to spend more than an hour , but a good place to come with your friends who have doggies with a need to socialize .
I do not go to dd often ( trust me , i 'd like to , but my waistline begs to differ ) but decided to pop in just before closing .
The variety was not too terribly wide , but for obvious reasons .
I have never had a better general tsu 's chicken in my life .
I would love to stay one night for drinks but have not got around to that yet .
I have never been here and had a bad experience and i will definitely recommend to others !
No lie waste of time and money .
They where fresh . but also dry . . not sure if i will order again from here
Moved to charlotte in '93 and this place has been open for over 40 years and i never ate here before .
Usually go to portifino's but never ever again ( see review to find out why ) .
Everywhere looked dingy but not dirty i guess .
Seats were not that much cleaner .
No paper towels in the bathroom had to use a napkin i had in my bag to open the door after drying my hands with the oldest hand dryer ever .
Another side note : never touch public door handles with your bare hands esp in the restroom ( e.coli is hella real ) .
Call me weird but i never get sick and i am a nurse ( we are all a little weird i think lol ) .
Did not touch it .
Did not look clean at all .
Maybe keeps getting refilled but not cleaned .
Both entrees were not so good .
I do not really get the food but i feel waffle house has the best waffles !
Sunday afternoon when everyone goes out to eat and they never have what you want , it 's fair that they offer you something else but you go exactly there for one reason .
I experienced massages from all female staffs except one , and i will talk about the best three female staffs ( i have never gotten massages from male staffs ) .
Of course , she does not twist your neck or waist .
She works fast not to miss any of your body part she can massage .
Rachel ( not rachael janelle who i have not tried yet ) - if you want more relaxed , soft styled massage , go for her .
She has a similar massage style to kalina 's but with less force and no chiropractic component ( no stretching ) .
I am not sure whether she still charges extra money for her oil .
When i got hot stone massage from her , she did not charge extra money .
They are also friendly , do not hesitate to tell what you want .
Also , i am still a student , and not a most generous tip giver .
Everyone needs to understand that this is not new york style pizza .
It is very good but do not be going in expecting to get a slice of new york style pizza .
This time , the lady taking your order was extremely rude and my torta had very little carne asada and it had no flavor .
I will not be returning or recommend to anyone .
I went for the sushi and was not disappointed .
Only negative thing was the people that were next to us , but you can not control who comes to the business .
You can not go wrong for $ 10.00 .
Not to be confused with some of the other inns and huts .
They can not hold a candle to the house .
I have not tried the sandwiches yet ( next visit ) , but the pizza is incredible .
The sauce has great flavor but does not overpower , and they are generous with the toppings .
Now , i am not a fan of the floppy , ends - up - in - your - lap ny style pizza .
The bathroom was gross and not clean at all .
The staff working was rude and not timely with their delivery of the actual coffee .
I do not know if it s because of the fresh cut pieces of peach in the pitcher or the quality of wine they use to mix but what ever it is you got ta try it .
Well , i was really hoping to review this as a 3 star establishment , but i would not classify this place as " a-ok " .
Because , eek ; methinks not !
Once which was meh , and the other time which was absolutely horrible and can not be forgiven on any level .
My first time here was barely memorable and so was the food , so i can not really speak on it much .
She looked at us , as if we screamed " no tip " upon her greeting us .
On top of that , it had an extremely fishy smell and taste , which means it was not fresh .
The only reason i did not throw a fit was because our grandmother was buying and she is very old .
The saturday nights were the busier nights when i went but with my limited number of times i have been , i can not say if that is the norm or not .
I also did not care for the fried rice .
Not a solution .
I did not feel welcome and probably will never go back .
One of the few places that serves up lamb kabobs without including beef in it , which is great for people like me who do not eat beef .
Ihave not tried their lunch combos , but they are very reasonably priced , so i will definitely check it out soon .
We can not wait to go back !
The only reason they are not getting a 5 / 5 is because the service was just okay , kinda slow and not very attentive .
Maybe i do not like napolitan pizza .
There was not much of anything on either .
Two pizzas , no drinks or salads $ 35 !
Not worth it in my opinion .
For a chain asian restaurant in suburban ohio , it 's not bad .
It seams , it s not the same .
The chile verde burrito has great flavor , while i am not a big fan of their red .
One thing though ... be ready to grab your drink , if fresh fruit drink , if you do not take it someone else will gladly take it for you .
Did not take too long for him to get us drinks .
My guests can not get enough of the soup , delicious , creamy and not too spicy .
I did not ask them to comp my room , they offered and i thought the issue was settled .
Another thing that irritated me is that when i asked for a manager , adam told me there was no manager available which i did not believe .
I told them point blank i was not giving them authorization to charge my card and now my file is " open " and i will be contacting a manager to get this situation handled .
At the end of the day it is not about the money but the fact that i was told something twice only to be surprised when i come downstairs .
If you are not willing to comp your guests when there are issues , do n't offer to in the first place .
While it does smell " fishy " you would expect that at a fish market and it did not make the atmosphere uninviting in the least .
This was my first poke experience and it certainly will not be my last .
Not much more you could ask for :)
Just can not get enough of the great service jim and his team provides every single time !
I do not remember jack astors being that bad .
It satisfied my craving for seafood , but did not leave me wanting more .
It was filling , but it just did not impress me much .
Sometimes too edgy does not work !
Also , there are no taxis waiting at the hotel , so they encourage a private car which is much more expensive .
There are not many people working the lobby desk , so there may be a wait .
I do not know about the other hotels , but the ritz would be my choice .
This is not a place for cocktails .
It definitely sells itself as a lounge - style cocktail bar but simple drinks could not be made .
The scene was not at all exciting and just seemed like a fancy looking dive with stragglers .
I will admit that the dj was pretty good and played excellent music , but even his great skills were not enough to make this place worth hanging out at .
The steaks and mashed potatoes / vegetables arrived cold while the chicken salad arrived with no chicken .
The food was not redone and quite obviously just placed under a heat lamp .
Finally , the inexperienced manager simply did not know how to remedy the failings of his staff .
Will never be returning to this location .
If you looking for gourmet , this ai not the place .
That being said the roll was not tail .
Also , those that are saying the portions are small for the bowls , i do not agree .
I can not wait to go back .
I have here for 45 minutes and i still have not received my food
I was starving and i was not craving anything while i was walking down downtown las vegas .
Actually me and my girlfriend could not decide what to eat so basically we ended up here .
The shrimp cocktail was not too bad and better than the chinese food .
I love knowing a business is investing in and supporting their community , but that 's not the only reason to love voodoo .
The art displayed on the walls , ceilings , and throughout the interior is not the only reason i love voodoo either .
Being able to bring my dog ( on a leash ) and buy a frosty brew is not the only reason why i love voodoo .
Could not believe that a veggie burger at a bar could be so good !
I do not understand these low reviews .
1st and foremost , if your going to leave a review on yelp , please speak proper english not gibberish or broken english .
I am not trying to be mean but as a user we take these ratings seriously .
I am a mechanic myself but do not have the time to do small things like oil changes and flushes but that 's why i go to jim here at meineke .
I am a fan of high abv brews , and this place certainly did not disappoint .
I can not complain about any of it .
Not too much in the way of vegetarian fare ( thus the 4 stars ) , but the margarita pizza i got was still pretty tasty .
The front doors were open , because it was a nice spring night , and the bar was not too crowded .
Even if it had been , i feel like i would not have felt crunched and uncomfortable .
I assume that is not good for the paint .
Went at the last moment so could not order enough , but surely going back to try more varieties on their menu .
This place is not impressive from the outside , but is quite spacious inside .
Do not go here !
Not to mention that they slopped armorall all over my car , so now there is greasy patches all over my seats .
I would not go back .
It was not priced like a single slider ...
It came with a large portion of fries but they were not hot and they lacked flavor .
( pet peeve - paying same or more for food at places that do not offer full service . )
No regular brewed tea .
Great vibe and fantastic craft brews in an artfully restored century - old fire / police station ... do not miss the 2 cell jail tucked around the corner from the arcade .
I have visited their meadville brewery often , and just love it , so this opening just means i have a never ending supply of wy nona 's big brown ale .
If you have never been to the meadville brewery , you are in for a treat .
It 's not just the fact that the building itself is an old municipal building , but then throw in the hand painted / chalk / spray paint art on the walls and even ceilings and you have got a great vibe going .
I did try a sample of their big black voodoo daddy ( which was not included in the sampler ) , and it was awesome !
The place does not look much more than a fast food chinese counter , but the eggs were fried , the swiss cheese melty , and the bacon crispy delicious , all served on a buttery piece of toast .
I still enjoy stopping by to check out the beers ; however , the past few times we have gone , there has not been very many new beers on the tap list .
Refined was okay but the other two were not that good .
There 's a kitchen now ( i have not tried their food , yet ) , they have games to play , and they also host events and trivia nights .
So nice going to a car wash where you do not feel pressured into buying a new windshield or into getting a wax .
Good drinks here , do not come cheap .
Overall a good hangout spot if you do not mind the pricey drinks !
Everything in the decor seems to be recycled and turned into something else for example old doors served as tables and the no surface , ceiling included was left untouched by art .
I enjoyed how the space looked small but did not feel that way at all .
The bar is almost as big as the never ending craft beer menu .
Last but not least how could i forget the staff ?
Shrimp roll was not good .
We had a great time and definitely will be visiting often , can not wait to come in this summer and check out the rooftop bar .
Hub went bad again in 18 months and that should almost never ever happen on a new hub .
I do not mind paying taxes but hiding a $ 5 shop supplies fee is literally called stealing .
Will never go back .
Beware do not leave anything behind !!
Well that did not happen .
I called loss prevention 3 times with no response .
Finally got a manager on phone who said they did not find the item .
Quoted me the compressor for $ 1200 and said they will not charge me for the freon fill today .
They said the freon was completely empty there was no leaks , and only charged me $ 60 .
I never have had a bad time or a bad beer here .
( long community style tables . ) even during prime time , it 's not too crowded .
They have a good variety , which is my big gripe at other breweries , but not at voodoo !
No matter in what part of the city you are in , if all else fails , jack astors is your last resort .
Portions were huge , so huge we both could not finish it , as we both had dinner earlier .
The gm , jim was friendly and did not speak down to me because i was a woman ( as many other mechanics do ) .
I will not take my mini cooper any where else .
Maybe cause they are in a casino they do not really care about customer service because there 's always another tourist that does not know better to stop by but i am a local and will definitely never return .
There are several people walking around with manger printed on their shirts that do not seem to give a darn about the type of work being done .
It was my first time here and i was not disappointed !
You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here !
The bartenders are really nice here and i did not have to pay anything for my vodka tonics because i was gambling .
I wish that they would not allow cigars in the casinos .
When he took tip did not give back key fob car idled for over half hour while they dryed and vacuumed inside .
I guess i was last to know not to use any more .
The neighborhood is not what i 'd call posh , but welcome to the burgh .
To be clear , my only review here is of the associated parking garage ( where the valet associated with the 9 parks ) , and not the hotel .
The police officer also told me that this is not an uncommon occurrence at the 9 parking garage .
Other than the fact that they sell sinclair gas i can not think of a reason to go back .
I just had the truck washed , and i am not expecting a detail , but for the super , i expect my truck to actually be clean i should not have to hunt on the floor for my things that were in the cup holders !
I will not return !
The thing i do not like about round bars is that is is difficult for bartender to see all the customers behind them if they are facing the outside of the circle .
So when we first got there we sat down for a bit but then i realized that we could not see the bartender and he could not see us .
I did not expect that as centrifuge is chill yet clubby - flatscreens with sports on but in a low lit and high - ceiling environment with ambient music playing .
So for those of you who are on a budget or just do not like clubs , for whatever reason , this is decent option .
No complaints .
Not even a " thanks for coming in " or " how was everything " when she slid the check at us.
The burger comes , it 's average , and there 's no silverware or napkins .
Ill continue to drink the beers , but i will never come back to this unsafe neighborhood to drink beers in a garage with a bunch of pretentious , unwelcoming service people .
I was pretty impressed with not only the service here , but the available items to choose from .
If you are not into raw fish it 's still a great salad place .
I got it with no cabbage or cucumbers but added wasabi peas , edamame , pepper flakes & cilantro .
Their super kind worker let me try a good portion of their options , which i did not expect at all but i am glad bc i do not think the others were my type , but they were interesting .
Not cubed , not slush , but good .
And i adore the fish lines they painted in the parking lot instead of the regular straight line , never seen that anywhere else !
A flight of 6 beers for a low price of $ 10 can not be beat .
There were no duds in any of the offerings .
I bought bottles of the hoodoo so maybe my opinion may change but they do not have a standout beer that forces me to go there .
Do not get me wrong , it is still worth the trip all the beers are solid and the decorum is great .
If i could , no stars would be my honest review .
I should have known better when my husband asked for a sample of the orange chicken and the associates response was " we do not give samples . " the orange chicken was like eating a fried batter soaked in orange jam , beyond sweet and little to no chicken .

When i went to cash out , the server could not find my card and said the waitress had it .
They could not find it .
I finally get it and sign it , when a friend points out that due to the fruatration i should not have to pay .
It s 8 bucks and change but i do nt care i will not pay for a third damn beer .
I will never go to this bar again .
I have no complaints .
Do not go there .
The guy in the front desk had a bad joke he not try to help nothing but push you to other place .
On the other hand , the other front desk guy ( i did not even bother to remember his name ) was so rude and nasty .
One time , i asked him to break $ 20 bill because of the valet , he did not say anything ( not even " ok " or " sure " ) , went in the back , came back and just threw the change on the desk .
I did not even hear one word from him .
I never saw him with a smile in that 4 long weeks .
As this hotel is marriott group , do not they tell front desk employees to put fake smiles on their face even bad days ??!!!
No coffee machine in the room .
I am not a fan of this jack astor because i find the service to be lacking here .
It took forever for food to come and the place was not even busy !
It was quite an odd pizza to eat so i would not order it again .
I would come back to jack , not for a full meal but perhaps just appetizers or desserts because i think they do those the best .
I do not know if this has been around , but this was the first time i saw it .
I do not like the old victorian hotels because they seem outdated and old .
I was not a fan of their guacamole , but the nachos were otherwise decent .
The glasses they provided us were not chilled , which is always bothersome for me .
If you want a cool place with more than just poke , look no further than hi-tide .
This was my second poke experience in charlotte and it did not disappoint !
Everything was so fresh and i almost regret not getting more toppings than i did !
Not a big deal as the $ 10 cover went to a good cause ( and a beer ticket ) , but i wish the event would have been posted on their site earlier so i could have let others know before arriving .
Not too good , either food or value .
" deuces " eggs and potatoes not cooked very well .
By comparison , coffee outrageous in price , with no refills !
Definitely not a good deal for cafeteria food .
There are two large garage doors which open to the street for fresh air but no outdoor seating .
They are dog friendly , which i always find to be a plus even though i do not have a dog .
No food or food trucks either of the times i have visited .
It seems as if the metropolitan focuses on telling you what you can not do versus what a hotel should be saying " what can i do for you " which is what the hospitality business is supposed to do . after our rehearsal dinner on friday night the entire group that was staying at the hotel decided to go back to the rooftop bar for a drink .
We got to the bar and the door men told us we can not come in because one of the guests was wearing casual shoes .
When we checked in to the metropolitan they did not even acknowledge that it was our wedding .
No congratulations .
No upgrade and definitely no special treatment . ) - elevators - they are using some new age elevator system that is next to impossible to master in a weekend .
In these rooms you can not have both .
Even if you do not consume it .
We went here on a wed and it was not too busy some reason the service was so slow and the food was horrible the calamari was super dry so was my deluxe burger , the pasta shrimp was bland also the worst cesar cocktail i ever tasted .
I do not recommend coming here .
It seems like it s not the best place to be during holidays as this place is too overwelmed .
I am not a huge beer drinker but both of these were so delicious .
Do not go asian ( i.e pad thai ) .
Finally , when greeted i was told no one was available to work on my car .
So i said ok .. so this coupon is no good for me , he got all hopped up on attitude and said " well if you read the coupon you can use it if you use that specific kind of oil . " did not we just do this ?
So i said ok .. so this coupon is no good for me , he got all hopped up on attitude and said " well if you read the coupon you can use it if you use that specific kind of oil . " did not we just do this ?
I just got done telling you i do not use that specific kind .
I will never go back here or to any other location .
They think they can fix but they can not or they too damn lazy .
So i went places all they did was aligned and it straight and the tires did not worn as quickly .
I am not sure i have ever stayed at a hotel in my life i would say was worth the money , but this hotel definitely was !
My wife and i were looking for a one - night get away at a local hotel , but never expected it to be so amazing .
It 's not that it was the largest room we had ever stayed in , but it was by far the nicest .
There were no cheap , cut corners here .
If you are coming in town for a weekend , or just looking to get away with your loved one , or family , i could not recommend this hotel enough .
Although we are locals , i do not think my wife and i had ever had such a fun time in downtown cleveland .
Menu seems fine for lunch but probably would not come here for dinner .
The central location on the casino floor ... elevated for great people watching wicked potent drinks the beautiful female staff that remembers your name .... no hooters vibe !
Huge portions , good flavor and just in general can not go wrong with it .
I am assuming he was up - charging me because i had no clue what the code meant .
Told him my situation with the first mechanic and what supposably was wrong with my car and before he told me prices he actually asked me a bunch of questions that the first guy did not even ask me !
Brought my car in the next day and he gave me the same price he told me on the phone , not a dollar more !
I do not usually leave yelp review but this place and especially jim gave awesome customer service !
I was not going to make the bartender make another one when he seemed overwhelmed with guests .
I purchased a monthly pass at the ray road location ( like i do every month ) and it was still valid and they basically called me a liar because it was not showing in their computer system .
The manager was not helpful at all and after a few minutes of arguing ( and i am not an argumentative person ) i just figured it was not worth it and said i would pay for wash .
Then she wanted to charge me for the more expensive wash i did not ask for !
I said i am not paying for that and at least she just charged me for the wash i ordered .
They offered me a free car wash for next time , problem is there will not be a next time .
When busy service can be a bit slow , but we just can not not spend a little time here whenever we are at the mgm , which is pretty frequently .
Can not wait to go again soon and try all their combos !
They care about what i want , and not just trying to up - sell me .
They matched a competitors price ( which i appreciated ) and the service people did not seem like shady or slimy car people .
I did not give them five stars because they quoted me one hour , and took over two .. but other than that - i 'd go back again .
Do not know how the staff got hired they are rude and slow and clearly do not care about what they are doing .
No so called soft bristles slapping your car .
Do not have a coupon then go to their website for one .
You can not go wrong with an edible $ . 99 shrimp cocktail in vegas , right ?
You may not get too many shrimp and there 's lots of sauce on the bottom to fill the cup but at least try this once if you are in the area .
It 's not amazing but come on it 's a $ . 99 shrimp cocktail in vegas , got ta try that at least once .
I do not normally give five stars even for places i really like but it is that good .
I waited another five minutes during which the bar tender rushed passed me many more times , again , this was in no way a full bar and seemed to be pretty heavily staffed .
At the end of this five minutes the entire staff of the bar proceeded to dance on the bar and fill / take no drink orders .
Do not go here !!
They do not deserve your business .
Trying to charge you hundreds of dollars more for something that probably does not need fixing .
Went back in to have another diagnostic performed to find out it was not my spark plugs to begin with , it was my coil cap and charged me an additional $ 240 .
And if you do not have the money to have the service done they mock you and tell you to ask your friends and family .
This place does not care about making your day any easier or saving you alittle change in the end , so sad .
I left , went to a spray wand wash down the street and it was like a miracle ... no clay , no detailing just washed the soap dried residue off and the car looked like it should after drying .
I have no idea why a re-wash was not done at the business , i do know i will not return to get a bad car wash , deal with an incompetent attendant .
I love that they did not try to up - sell me on all kinds of additional services , like air filters .
I did decline a decent deal on steam cleaning the interior , but i know they will probably offer me that same deal anytime i go , so i was not that worried about passing up the deal of a lifetime .
When they were done , i did not even recognize my car - i had forgotten what color it was under all the arizona dust . ( fyi - it 's red ) .
Was in and out of here in no time !
Will not be taking my vehicle here for any type of service due to your customer service .
Your service advisor / cashier ( wearing no name tag ) was extremely rude not only me but also to the customers that were ahead of me when i got there .
Well when it was my turn to talk to him no hello just " what u need ? "
I told him i am here for an appointment , he checked seen i needed a diagnostic too and said you are gon na be here for 3 hours , i said oh i am sorry i did not know it was going to take that long and can you just do an oil change only for today ?
He said no we can not do your oil change today that 's not how it works and proceeded to lecture me in front of other customers about booking appt online and how your system operates .
I wanted to tell him that online your appointment system is very vague and does not say how long you will need my car but instead i told him to cancel everything and walked out .
Good beer , good food , can not go wrong .
We did not eat here but the people sitting next to us said it was amazing .
My complaint is there was no ac so it was humid that day and we had to leave early because it was so hot .
Being in an old building it 's understandable but there was no air flow .
Since all the guests have not arrived as of yet the hostess suggested that we take the table for 5 and when another table opens up we can move over to that area .
My partner ordered sliders ( which did not come on hawaiian rolls as stated on menu ) and the rainbow bowl and agreed that we will give them some time to work it out before maybe trying it again .
( he was a little stuck on being served canned oranges though so not sure how soon that will be ) service : good .
Vegas never fails to produce some interesting people haha .
Even though they are not that great , it 's entertaining nonetheless !
I have not seen the work done yet so i will update this review .
I appreciate this person trying to help me but spending the extra money for services i did not desire when they do offer the very thing i inquired about is frustrating .
I can not speak to their ability to maintain or repair vehicles .
I went to the gentleman at the counter to ask if they could loosen the plug , at which point the shop manager , who was lazily lounging in one of the customer chairs in the lobby piped up and said " no , i do not usually do that " .
Well i do not usually pay people who laze around in the customer waiting area to change the oil on my car either .
I stopped by jiffy lube , who had plenty of customers , and they loosened my oil plug with no nonsense and no charge .
That person however will never again be me .
It is not quick so do not come in thinking you will get your car back in 5 minutes , all sparkly clean .
They only use one rough sand paper and no fine sanding to sand out the fine scratches .
Never again !
I have not seen anything like this - it is distinctive .
The menu is awesome mind you no food just beer .
I said cheap , not the greatest .
We told them we wanted the regular " preferred basic " oil change ( $ 24 ) , which what they have putting in for the past years but they will not do it because they said toyota recommends synthetic oil ... it sucks , because both of our cars are being service here all the time especially oil changes and it 's sad that we will be looking for a different place now ...
Not happy with the service , first of all john who work at the front desk is very disrespectful and unprofessional .
Too much shrimp sauce , too much celery , not enough shrimp for the insane amount of cocktail sauce in the cup .
Never again will i fall for any kind of seafood that 's under $ 1.00 .
Did not get the attitude the other reviews mentioned .
Chinese was not so good .
If you do not want to wait until 11 pm for the market street café at the california hotel to offer oxtail soup , come over to the lanai express at the fremont hotel .
She did not say she could go to the kitchen for more .
Now why could not she go and get a fresh pot while we were there ?
I have been wanting to check out voodoo for a while and finally made it this weekend , it did not disappoint !!!
I regret not getting a growler .
Can not wait to go there again , and i will for sure be leaving with a growler !
Restaurant can get noisy so make sure you do not mind that type of atmosphere
It 's not fancy , not ridiculously expensive , and they take reservations on weekends , which is a nice touch .
I have not had their chinese food but i wanted to give it a mention .
I have given this place only 4 stars because i have tried the other breakfast offerings and i honestly did not enjoy it .
Be aware however that valet parking is 38 dollars , which i thought was a tad steep for cleveland , ohio and do not touch anything in the minibar area due to the products being on sensors and the front desk will immediately charge you whether you put it back or not .
It has a vegas feel and décor as the decorations are not your typical of marriott .
In fact , most of the people i was with did not even realize it was a marriott .
Again , it 's not your typical layout which i find is an added plus .
He said do not worry and grabbed one of his employees , chris to pop my lock .
He said it will be no charge and to come in again for my next oil change .
I am not a fan of an actual bar within a casino - i prefer just the bar itself snaked against the wall , or drinking and gambling at the tables .
Centrifuge had an attitude that i can not really put my finger on it - maybe it was the bartender wanting to go home , or having a judgment on us because we were drinking still .
But ... is not that the point ...?
Do not you want us to drink ... more ?
It was for takeout and i did not get a fork or napkins or salt or soy sauce or anything to add flavor .
I will never go back .
My only knock is that they can not serve food here .
Not sure if it 's going to be bi-weekly or monthly but the meetings will be at 7:00 on a tuesday .
Remember , meetings are not only for alcoholics .
They were friendly , professional & courteous and could not of been more empathetic .
I mean , if he did not know how to make a manhattan he could have told me and given me a shot of something instead .
Jim and the guys at the shop have done a great job not only fixing but also standing behind their work when a part has been defective .
I drive a european sedan notorious for problems , and im not gon na lie i have spent a lot of money fixing my car issues with them but they have always stood behind their work and the parts that they have sold me .
It definitely was not crowded so we were able to sit wherever .
Staff was great , the restaurant was extremely clean , warming and i can not wait to go back for oysters on the half shell happy hour .
It 's obviously not as good as pad thai from an authentic thai restaurant , but still yummy .
My only complaint is that it was not spicy enough for me and i wish they had given the option of choosing spicy or mild .
I am not sure what kind of sauce they use on it , but the mixture of the cheese and tomatoes with the sauce is pure heaven .
It 's usually fairly busy here , so be sure to make reservations or come during an off period if a crowded restaurant is not your thing .
2 . it 's what fieri would call a " dive " 3 . the food ai not bad , but it ai not great .
This is not the ritz !
I am not a fan of the maine style lobster roll ( why i deducted one star ) .
Not upset but a little disappointed , i ordered beef with broccoli and when i got back to my office , i had only one piece of beef in my meal .
Decided to not go to my car dealer anymore for my oil change because they took too long .
The food is on a food truck level so do not go expecting a sit down meal with service .
I received my order almost instantly since there was no line going into midnight .
The meat was surprisingly very tender but were not falling of the bones which i like .
The broth was really good and not too greasy or salty , but having lots of portobello mushrooms does change the flavor of the oxtail soup due to the woodsy flavor from the mushrooms .
The only downfall with this meal to me , the bowl was not the right size to enjoy this meal .
The soup was warm and not hot and that should not matter what time of day someone would be dining in .
They all look totally amazeballs in their outfits , all the right ratio of hipster chic - but they were not actually helpful when asked a question .
I would not recommend .
What 's not to love ?
As soon as a pulled - in i knew i wanted a mid- level wash but no sooner than i put in my request the attendant tried to upsell me like crazy .
The stall doors in the women 's room can not close and / or lock properly .
Which if you are not in a rush , and know you just need an oil change , they are ok .
But for auto repair work , i do not trust this location .
The last time i went here ( 2016 ) , they lied about what needed to be fixed & tried to sell me on repairs i did not need .
They did not even mention it .
It was not until i went to another auto shop that i found honest mechanics .
Never coming back & i do not recommend getting repairs here .
Reason for 2 stars is that i did get an oil change before with no issues & they can do basic stuff but buyer beware !
Not looking good to see more cars waiting to be dried than workers doing the drying drove away and discovered at 40 mph a skid plate was not secured .
I do not know how much damage there was but i am taking it to ford to find out .
Horrible place max was horrible and john the manager can not manage also he help out zero on the situation
The meal was only $ 23 not including the beer my girlfriend ordered .
Highly recommended and we will not wait 6 weeks for our next visit !
I can not believe this has happened again to me and my son at this restaurant .
I asked to be moved , as the restaurant was not even half full ( wonder why ) and she flat out said no .
Then they tell us there is no debit but we can use a credit card .
Well my friend , as this restaurant is obviously prejudiced against white people , i will never go back to any jack astor 's again .
Oh , jack astor , train your so called hostesses to do their jobs instead of this and teach them that the customer comes first , not a social conversation with each other .
Max not only stayed with my wife and i but then drove us to our cleveland heights home while the tow truck delivered my car to the mechanic 's shop .
Stopped in here waiting for a friend and the name just drew me in . too bad the drinks do not get served in a centrifuge , but it is a quaint little place in the middle of the mgm .
They will give you tasters so you do not have to purchase a whole beer just to try it , i would suggest for first timers to get their flight , you pick 5 beers you want to try it 's great .
I docked them a star because they do not inform you if he tap is out until after you order .
But no , this was one of the most professionally - managed openings i have ever seen .
This obviously was not voodoo 's first rodeo , having done scores of popular bottle releases over the years .
As with the service , the product is refined through years of experience that unfortunately can not be faked .
It did not hurt that they broke out some special kegs for the opening , but they have enough draft lines here that i would be shocked if they did not regularly have something interesting on offer .
Not all of their beers are my favorite , nor honestly is the decor really much to my liking ( i think an old building like this has enough charm on its own not to need brash paint schemes , but that 's just me ) .
Minor gripes aside there is no way not to be absolutely thrilled with this addition to pittsburgh 's scene .
It did not break up easily .
I usually go shopping while i wait for my car ( which is another plus about this location ) so as i was browsing ross one of the employees ( i believe he was manager at the time ) called me and told me while they were rotating my routers they noticed heat spots or something that was not good ..
Even when they told me my transmission fluid should be changed i was not sure but they were happy to dip a test strip in the transmission fluid and show me it should be changed .
Ambience is cool - big wall to wall glass windows , fancy decor , etc . but i can not eat ambience , can i ?
I know jake said he reads yelp reviews , which is why i am writing this so he can take note of my personal experience and hopefully correct this so no one else has the same experience .
One particular bar tender ( i am choosing not to physically describe him but would be happy to if asked ) made eye contact with me multiple times and never asked if i needed anything but asked the guys sitting next to where i was standing at the bar if they needed anything , then he walked right by me to a couple that just walked up to the bar when i had been standing there for at least 5 - 7 minutes not being served .
There was another bar tender who also never asked if i needed anything ( meanwhile , i am standing with the beer list in hand ) , but since he momentarily paused in front of me , i said ( and after waiting 10 minutes , yes , i was a bit frustrated ) , " can i get a couple of drinks when someone gets a chance ? "
I feel that i was being ignored , for whatever reason i am not sure .
....... good thing this was a yelp event because if this was my only interaction / experience at this voodoo location , i guarantee i would not be back , regardless of good beer or not .
Can not beat the price for a handwash .
I was not sure what to order , so i checked yelp for an idea !
There was no flesh just burnt crumbs .
Staffs look like they are not interested in there customers .
Been to other ja locations , which are way better and no complains .
Is horrible will never go back in there
I do not even drink , but i love it here .
Never been at this location before but i have been to the franchise many a time .
It 's the kind of service you hope for but never expect these days but with jim and rick i know it 's going to happen .
Once again i brought my car in with a strange sound it turned out to be nothing and was not charged a dime .
Try to find that kind of service anywhere else , it just does not happen .
If u have mint to waste go here .. believe me when i say i have never given las than a 3 star ..
I mean i could not even finish the food .. that 's how bad ..
Crazy fun does not describe it , hot people overflow from other clubs into here .
I asked but he never answered my question straight , he only responded with questions like " are you sure that 's what it is ?
Maybe it 's the battery or something else " and i am like " i do not think so , i believe it 's the alternator " , so when i thought he was giving me an estimate for how much it would cost .
It was not what i thought at all , he ended up running a full diagnostic without my permission and when i had to sign for $ 616 worth of repairs on my van i decided to ask him not to go through with it because it was too expensive .
I did not ask for a diagnostic i only wanted to repair my alternator , " so i told him i am not paying for it because i already knew i had a bad alternator .
I do not need to be charged $ 95 for you to tell me i have a bad alternator when i am the one telling you i have a bad alternator / " yup " he responds as a hustler would say with no respect for others , " you have a bad alternator that will be $ 95 " , with no repairs done to my car , i am like " i do not have to pay " i already knew i had a bad alternator and i did not ask for a diagnostic , so i called the cops !
" it 's illegal for you to charge me for work i did not request " ( he laughed with his cocky rude rude comments and assumptions , because he knew the results in the end was for me to pay him . )
" i am not going to pay you $ 95 for you to tell me what i already knew , " i said .
Then he decided to hold my car keys and said i could not have my keys until i pay $ 95 for a diagnostic that he bullied me into signing .
Bullying with his words because of his over confidence he did not ever listen when i asked him from the very beginning on what i needed done to the car when i first asked him .
Instead he bullied me into the diagnostic because he knew what he was doing from the beginning , manipulating me into paying him for work i already knew about which is why i came there in the first place , but he did not care about my needs , only the hustle .
Maybe he won today because he does this every day but his foul play was ill and needed to be shared , do not go here !
Do not trust this shop especially jim the guy who 's in charge , the job position has gone to his head , he rips people off and takes advantage of single hard working moms .
He has no guilt or shame for his dishonest actions !!!!!
Do not have your car worked on here !!!!!
This company has no concern with how i was wrongfully charged for work i never requested due to poor listening skills from their manager who bullied our conversation .
I had to ask permission to speak about my own car because he was so busy making assumptions and never listening .
The so called comment from this company pretending to be concerned is fake , i responded to them and never heard back from them and never got a refund for my $ 95 !!!!
Do not go here , they are liars !!
It was said there would be snacks offered all day however we only saw fiber one bars available there is pop , water , and coffee available at all times however they did not keep it well stocked and there were no waters at midnight when we got back from the game .
After all was said and done not sure the reserve floor is worth it but did enjoy the happy hour .
The reason i gave a 4 star instead of 5 is when we received our bill they had charged us for several items like an ipod charger kit that can be found in the room which we never opened or used .
We addressed it with the front desk and they took care of it no problem but make sure you check your bill at checkout !!!!
This one was unique compared to most other poke places because you order from the menu at the counter , but you do not see the ingredients when you are ordering and you do not watch them make it .
They had a large variety of ingredients , but it was hard to order because i did not know what several of them were .
One of my favorite lounges in vegas .... and it 's not even a big time or main stream lounge to begin with .
It 's trendy so we expected it to be more expensive than it should be , so that was not a surprise .
The atmosphere was not my style .
Pretty cold , but i did not eat there so i do not want to judge something i did not experience .
It 's definitely worth a try but i am not sure we will be back .
Interior , i do not like being able to see spots that were treated and spots they completely missed .
Id be happy with a wipedown and no treatment than a half ass one .
I did not finish my pasta , nor would you , if you were in my position .
After i did not eat had it pushed to the front of table , i had manager show up , -aleeza , she took care of the bill and brought another meal for me , but she was open to my suggestion to fix your friday evening chefs .
The music is top 40s and is not loud , so you can easily carry conversations with good friends and have a great time .
The teriyaki chicken had little flavor and was very fatty , the orange chicken did not convince either .
All the local car washes seem to move at a snail 's pace , which i do not understand - part of the reason i am willing to pay somebody else to do it is for the speed & convenience .
If you take 30 minutes ( when not even busy ) to get me out of there , you have defeated a lot of the purpose .
No complaints on my end .
Have not been in years ...
They have become fine dining prices and portion sizes ... but wtf , i did not come for that .
They were good , but just tiny ... kids meal was good and always fun to draw on the table ... but will not be back for another year
I think for a place to eat it suffices , it 's not horrible , but nothing so spectacular as to write home about either ..
Not tender , maybe i had the first of a new pot .
Tired from being up all night i think most people would not be up for it .
I do not recommend it unless you need to eat immediately to get back to your table or game .
It 's not cheap , but not expensive .
They let us have a later checkout we did not ask for till that morning .
My only regret was that i did note make not of the names of the staff members that made the experience exceptional .
We were really hungry ; and they were not busy at all so our food came pretty quick .
Our bill was $ 33 something so the prices was not bad .
While friendly , the service was not quick ...
It is not cheap , but the alcohol is good quality and they pour generously if you return the friendly attitude and do not make it a point to be a lecherous creep that goes for an up - skirt peep - show every time the waitresses get up to dance .
I never would have given this place a second thought but my mother and brother saw the $ 0.99 shrimp cocktail .
I had no complaints there .
The woman working was not terribly social , but she was not the stereotypical angry asian lady either .
Somehow i would not expect spectacular .
They did not get spectacular either .
I do not eat seafood , so i have no opinion on how it tasted .
They asked one employee there if they could rinse the shrimp off and get that horrible sauce off , not wanting to waste food / product .
Like she had no idea what a strainer was or even how to rinse something off .
Anyway , instead of rinsing the yucky sauce off , she just got them two new shrimp cocktails and they did not mix it into the sauce again .
Customer service was good , i had no complaints there .
I am not a big fan of chinese food though either .
It 's not a place that screams anything special to me .
Like i said , had we not noticed the sign and my family wanted to try it , i would have walked right by it and kept going .
45 minutes later i we nt back to the desk and was told they could not find me to tell me my room was available .
I was literally right in front of them and no one left the desk to " look for me " .
Once we got back to our room from a baseball game and a stop afterwards at a bar we realized we were not provided with bedding for the sofa bed .
By 3 am we still did not have the linens so i walked downstairs and was told they would bring them up in 20 minutes .
The cleaning crew was not told we needed 3 towels , sheets , blankets , and pillows , they were only told part of the materials .
For the money i paid , i could not have asked for much more .
When we arrived it was busy , but not crazy .
We waited ... we waited some more ... people came , ate , and left and we still were not fed .
She looked very flustered and said " i will check hold on ... i do not get paid enough for this " .
After another 10 - 15 minutes the manager came over and let us know that the ticket did not make it to the kitchen for whatever reason and kept saying he had no idea what happened ( assuring ... a manager who has no idea what happened or how to handle it ) .
Not the best poke i have ever had but possibly near - best in charlotte .
I just do not know if i will feel right patronizing a restaurant with such poor customer service .
Of course all these events took place when it was not that warm out , so i am super excited to go back when the two large garage doors are open !
There 's also a cute little water station so you do not have to wait at the bar to get some water .
I can not wait to spend my summer days here .
I get the joke , and believe me i do not think it 's funny .
I do not eat beef but for some reason i had multiple beef sliders when it was suppose to be oysters .
The quality of fresh ingredients is good , do not get me wrong but quality control on to go orders is an area that needs some attention . :(
On a recent trip to las vegas was hungry and was craving some chinese food and came across this place and i must say that i wish i had not , this place is one of the worst i have ever been to .
First food tastes like it 's been out all day , poorly cooked and very poor quality , service not good and over priced for what you get ... heck they even charge you .50 for a cup of ice water .
Terrible service , over priced , and they do not do that good of a job .
They did not even bother checking the ashtray to clean it out .
It was not there before i had the detail job done , but it was there immediately after .
Tucked away next to hakkasan , so it does not feel deserted like your normal casino bar .
Solid spot for people watching if clubbing is not your scene , and the bartenders were really friendly and willing to give drink recommendations .
Worst hotel experience of my life i have never written a hotel review except for a couple of 5 star exerpmeriences but i had to write about this hotel .
Highlights - the room was dirty , got charged for charges we did not incur , cold room service , terrible recommendations from the front desk , aggressive security staff , etc just a terrible experience .
It is now $ 5.99 for the sandwich and regular fries ( no more waffle fries , sooo disappointing ) , no drink included now so you would have to pay for that separately :(
It 's not a big enough price difference to make me boycott their kickass french dip and fries but it 's disappointing that there is no combo that includes a drink now .
I am not imagining it , in all truth i get a really bad headache when i eat it .
I do not know what they use to make it but it 's happened numerous times and the only variable is eating that food .
So no more chinese entrees for me .
The french dip is delicious and i have never had a problem with it .
No matter what time of the day i go as long as i schedule an appointment , i am always taken care of .
I went into the shop one morning last week with a weird noise that i was not used and they were able to figure out exactly what it was for me .
Offering everything from chinese food to pizza to burgers , this eatery is good if you need something in a hurry and do not have high expectations .
Quite frankly , i have not dared try the chinese food .
Would try not to go there anymore .
Next time , i will ask to see if there 's a way to get it with no salt ( i have high blood pressure , so always something i have to monitor ) .
I did speak to the manager because the inside of my car had not even looked like it was touched .
Not sure i will come back at $ 25 a visit .
They do not appear to be robotic and you do not see forced smiles .
I said it was very minor and that they were certainly not complaints - he said he always likes to bring the guests suggestions to the attention of the front office .
Once you get on you press no buttons , you are just taken to your floor .
We attended on a trivia night , and although we did not place , we still had a blast !
They do not nickel and dime over every ingredient so you can make your perfect bowl and not feel guilty .
Does not hurt that the sauces are amazing with quality meats .
My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge in the room .
I can not say enough nice things about this hotel .
I am already planning a trip next year to see an indians / tigers game and i can not wait !
When i came back to close it , one of the bartenders acted like he did not see my credit card .
I even saw it and told him that was mine but he still did not want to give me back my credit card after giving him my id .
Upon being told that they worked on a first come , first serve basis , i got nervous but when i arrived at this location , i did not have to wait at all !
The cashier , brittany , knew exactly what to do with my groupon and rang me out no problem .
I am so used to spending an hour and a half to two hours for my oil changes , but i was in and out with no problem .
My only gripe is that my car had water spots on it so they did not thoroughly dry my car after the wash , but otherwise i am a happy camper !
Also they have a 99 cent shrimp cocktail , and their chinese combo plates are not bad .
I had been to jack astor 's in the past ( the one in vaughan ) and was not all that impressed , but that was a while ago so i went with an open mind .
Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it was not that busy ( it was easter monday ) .
While both said the steak was cooked as ordered and was delicious , it was an open faced sandwich , which they were not expecting .
However , this did not prevent them eating everything on their plates .
If it would not have been too embarrassing , i am positive they would have licked their plates as well .
It 's interesting , i would have most likely not visited this restaurant based on some of the negative reviews , but glad that i did before reading them .
The place was busy , but not swamped , and it took about 30 - 40 minutes .
Do not trust this place .
We ordered our food right away because we were starving and could not wait any longer .
By 8:30 pm it became apparent no one else was showing up .
I can not describe how happy that made me feel !
Not only did she practice great customer service , but a huge level of empathy as well .
She was amazing and i could not have asked for a better server !
The suite was an open floor plan , so the bath and shower were not enclosed in a separate room .
I did not check out the amenities but was told there is a nightclub and theater with reclining chairs .
It simply was not good .
I also would not book the room for business ( no desk ) .
The staff makes you feel lucky to be there , and they are not welcoming at all .
Not my typical experience in pittsburgh .
No need to revisit .
I think i just do not like poke ... i was expecting it to be warm for some reason .
But it was cold , tasted very fishy ( like it 's supposed to , just not for me ) and i personally did not like the flavor combination of coconut rice and pinapple with the seaflood flavor .
Gorgeous entryway , helpful staff and elevators with no keypads .
I have gold status , but there 's no concierge lounge is the only drawback to the property .
Jack 's never fails i had the chicken parm with pasta the chicken was kind of small the pasta was tasty another entrée a beer and an aap almost 100 bucks
This is the only car wash that has never annoyed me with some little problem .
Prices are not cheap -- but match the level of service given .
I have also never run into one of those glass salespeople there , which really annoy me .
My steak was not cooked according to my request , so they took it back and had it done properly right away .
At the end of our meal , the manager approached me and said that desert was on them because of the steak , and i kindly declined because i was not hungry .
I do not know much about cars and i know most mechanics are scammers but at least do the job good !!
It 's not sensitive at all and feels like they did not even do anything at all .
I am upset they did not even do a good job , i do not even feel safe driving my car so i took it to a different place that will not screw me over .
Do not go here !!
I was able to drive home the next day and not wait .
Well this was the only piece i did not like .
I just said no thanks and he took off .
No more coke stains in the cup holders , the interior shined bright , the hold and bumper had about 95 % of the bugs removed which is by far the best i seen considering that we drive alot and very few car washes the bugs somehow have become part of the car .
I have since brought back car multiple times and could not have been any happier .
Not the worst food that i have ever had , but quite far from the best .
I would not eat there again if i had a choice .
The orange chicken and fried rice were good , but i would not recommend the noodles .
I would not consider it a deal .
It was not too busy while we were there .
There is not a parking lot - it s off street parking .. but i did not have a problem at all finding a spot .
There is not a parking lot - it s off street parking .. but i did not have a problem at all finding a spot .
The craft beer : voodoo love child - what a cool name and no doubt tasty .
This is something you never forget after tasting .
Wynona 's big brown ale - very tasty and thick and my favorite that i could not get enough of was .... " some people say cucumbers taste better than pickles " .
Drink refills are not free .
California does not charge for refills .
I did not .
Perhaps serve it in a shallower dish and get the ratio better so i do not have nicely topped chips on top and a bunch of dry ones below ?
Not many options late at night so this will do .
I order takeout pretty often and i feel that i always get a smaller portion , items are often forgotten on my build your own bowls and just not as much love given to my dish .
( side note : it does not take much for it to be very busy because the place is way too small ) either way i came in to hunt for a low chair for my fiancé because he can not sit at the high tops or stand for long .
I saw a table in the far corner that only had one chair and was not being used .
I explain my fiancé 's knee , we were not trying to cut the line but it was obvious that this table was not being used since they did not have enough chairs to go around .
No one every returned to our table to put us on the wait , i approached the counter and said we can just place a togo order since my fiancé can not stand and y' all are on a wait .
Shucking 8 oysters does not take long but ok ) my fiancés bowl was wrong , it was suppose to be half portions of two fishes and it was not plus a few ingredients left off .
She did not tell me which oysters were which or tell me about the sauces or anything .
He did not know either and had to go ask .
Then i said " i do not see any horseradish , may i please have some ? " the server points at a ramekin of ice " it 's right there " like i am stupid or something .
Overall it was an awful experience and my fiancé has sworn that we will not " waste our money here again " .
I personally have not sworn it off completely but i think they are really losing the spark they had upon opening !
Did not have the patience to wait .
Ordered oxtail soup , it was just as meaty as market cafe , however the broth was a little more salty , but no problem !
Also tried the loco moco ... not a fan .
I wanted spam musubi but they did not have so we opt for the loco moco .
The interior was not wiped , maybe only the steel wheel .
Not even comparable to some auto car wash !
Do yourself a favor , do not go to this car wash !
I am also really not one to complain about service since i like to give people the benefit of a doubt or cut them some slack but this waitress was just shady af .
Then she said after sighing " ok ... good to know . " first of all , if you are not mentally prepared to wait on two tables for a group , then either trade with someone or ask for help , but do not give your customers that type of attitude .
Or maybe even do n't be a waitress !
I had the hold the beef burger which is a vegetarian burger and the quality at this location was not as good as when i had it at scarborough town centre location .
Although we were considered a large group , not everyone ate and also everyone had individual bills .
How the bill was to be divided up , was never discussed with vikki k , but it is pretty common that bills are split individually , so they were .
If her service and attitude were outstanding from the beginning , then i have no problem giving a bigger tip .
Receiving vouchers was never my intention however he insisted that he send some .
Why did not they make my appointment when i was on the phone instead they tell me now it 's first come first serve .
I am pretty sure i am not employed there as i am wiping up his bar i am thinking this is crazy so i decide to leave & he says thank you ( as i obviously was not leaving him a tip after that ) wanting me to know i did not give him one i told management in the restaurant next door & they were appalled lol ..
Not for anything mgm you could have actually paid for our $ 20 lunch !
Not a bad chain restaurant .
My car was already pretty clean just dusty from not being washed for a couple of weeks .
Dash still had dust , interior door panels not wiped down and the cup holders had not been touched .
I told him they did not wipe down the inside of the car and he gives me this dirty pissed off look , closes my door and just walks off .
Will not be back a third time , too many other choices out there .
Do not know if the owner or upper management reads these reviews but you might want to pass on to your management on the line to check the employees work and not be rude to customers who pay $ 22.00 dollars to get a pretty substandard car wash .
First issue with the place - there is no clear signage on where to pull your car up for an oil change but what makes me give them a horrible review is their customer service and their hidden charges .
I was not expecting to pay anything as i already paid $ 45.00 for the oil change via groupon , well , to my shock the cashier informs me my total is $ 17.73 !
I asked why , they said i have to pay for the car wash as it is not free when using the groupon because , and i quote , " the groupon is already such a good deal . "
I then informed her that the attendant told me that the car wash was free even with the groupon , had i known there would be an additional charge , i would not have agreed to the car wash .
I know it s not free when using the groupon because my manager said it 's not free when using the groupon ... " well ... okay .. at this point , i reiterated to her that i was told by the attendant outside that it was free even with the groupon .
She should have apologized for the miscommunication with the employee and not charged me for something i did not agree to ( or ) at the very least , offer a discount for another service in the future .
On another note , full synthetic oil changes are typically $ 65.00 ; i paid a total of $ 62.73 , that is not a deal as i never agreed to the car wash !
My advice , do not go here unless you want horrible customer service and want to be charged for add on 's that you do not agree to .
The servers were quick and efficient , however the kitchen was not that day .
Staff : the women we ordered from had no clue what was going on .
There are three drink machines against the back wall and she did not know what was in them .
I had a flat tire that was slow leaking and not only did they repair it , they explained how tires change temperature with the weather and how the extreme cold to the extreme heat can greatly effect the way they wear .
Jim marco not only helped me understand the basics of tire rotation he explained how keeping tires on ones car until they wear out is super dangerous !
I have a black van so i do not use any brush washes .
Not quick service but always done in a reasonable time and i am happy to wait in order to get good service .
I called them when i got home and they told me to talk to a manager next time i came in . a week later i came in and talked to a manager , they re washed and cleaned my van with no hassle and it looks amazing .
The fries from the poutine was kind of cold and the gravy was not hot enough .
My car is a dark blue sedan , which will spot quickly if it is not dried quickly .
( why not keep the good times flowing ? ) we were impressed with the digs , loved the different ceiling panels by various artists , grooved on the voodoo theme and incredible artwork , and most importantly , dug the beers .
While i am not a brown ale gal , i was impressed with the wynona and would have complimented the server ... had we not been bizarrely invisible to the bartenders .
But after we walked in and sat at the bar , we could not get someone to pour us a beer .
I did not ask for that !
I have never ever been charged for something as simple as just checking me fluid levels in the 10 years i have been driving a car .
I do not recommend anyone to ever come here unless they like getting ripped off ... just saying .
Will never order here again
Fuhhinally tried hi tide poke & raw bar last night and i was not disappointed .
Ahi tuna was yummy , i did not feel like it was fishy at all .
They did forget the pickled onions , but i did not ask for them so i can not ding a star .
I do not have a death - allergy to nuts but i try to avoid and i was surprised they somehow ended up in my bowl .
For a quick meal that will not bog you down , we will probably be back again .
I liked how they shampoo'd the floor mats and put them in the trunk because they were still damp ( no sense in putting damp mats back ) .
No biggie , but if you are not sure , you should always double - check your work .
They promptly did the oil change in the time they advised , my service engine lite was on when i stopped in for the oil change and they ran a diagnostic and informed me of the code - they did not try to up - sell me at the time or pressure me into any repairs right away , but i was very appreciative of the knowledge they provided to let me know what the diagnostic came back with so that i had a starting point .
Come lunch time , we walked towards jack astor where there are no construction .
Can not stand the dust and noise whatever they are building near bier market and joe 's .
No complaints on that .
Overall , not bad .
But may not come back here for awhile .
I do not usually give one star , and i will not because the music is good .
Do not recommend if you want to spend an evening chilling at the bar , but hey if you want to give your money away , come on over !
Review subject to change : recently moved to gilbert from ca and the road was not very kind to my accord .
However i brought it here for a full detail , but with how busy it was i did not have enough time for my clay bar .
Can not wait to see my baby fully detailed by these hard working individuals .
I felt like i was in vegas and not in cleveland .
The bar looked fantastic , but we did not have enough time to enjoy drinks here .
Can not wait to come back and get more .
There was more we did not try , but it looked like you could come several times and not repeat a menu choice . this place is a good reason to come into the fremont hotel and since they are treating you so well , why not stay and gamble a bit ?
There was more we did not try , but it looked like you could come several times and not repeat a menu choice . this place is a good reason to come into the fremont hotel and since they are treating you so well , why not stay and gamble a bit ?
It 's affiliated with marriott but does not look , feel , or smell like a marriott ( a good thing ) .
Rates are comparable and the location can not be beaten .
Ok , so i have to admit that i would like to think that i know a thing or two about beer , but i had never actually been to voodoo !
I think ( but i am not completely sure ) that i had it once before at d's .
So , not only are they selling kick ass beer , but they are also promoting local artists !
The waitress we had talked to us like she was the alpha male of our group , and slammed the plates on the table when we told her something she did not want to hear , and she made fun of us when someone needed to be made fun of .. and we loved her !
It 's almost impossible to not order something when she came and asked whether if we wanted more beer .
So when i said no after a single bottle , i felt like a little bitch when she looked at me with those disapproving eyes .
Our friend jennifer did not end up liking her meal ( her fault because she ordered pad thai at jack astor 's ) , so the manager offered his apologies , and two gift vouchers to her .
All of the sudden , all of us wanted to not like our meals .
I have not witnessed any fights , and generally it s a friendly atmosphere .
There 's not much i can say about this jack astor 's that i have not said about any other jack astor 's .
At least nobody asked me for deposit my id so that i do not dine & dash like the bloor & yonge location .
I am a marriott executive platinum for life and do not plan to return here .
The front desk staff is not very knowledgeable and showed little concern for us .
My only critique is it could have used a little bit of sauce in it , but i am not going to knock off a star because i always have a lot of sauce on my food and i do not know that it 's " traditional " of poke to be covered in sauce .
We were so full from dinner that i did not feel like doing a flight .
Cons : unless you are going to the waterfront the location is not ideal .
I did not have the pizza , but it look just as amazing as i remembered !
We were seated at the edge of the bar , but i did not mind as long as i could see the screen .
Pictures do not do it justice .
The only reason that i did not give it 5 stars is that sometimes they miss the trunk and the cup holders , but it is definitely worth the money .
I can assure you this is not one of them and will detail the reasons why .
2 ) panhandlers at valet 3 ) dried soap bubbles on the shower glass in the room not from me .
6 ) bouncer staff was rude and not professional .
To my surprise not so much .
As soon as i opened up the car it was apparent it had not been vacuumed yet , the glass has not been cleaned along with everything else .
Yeah not so much .
As soon as i opened my back hatch to my sequoia it was clear they had not vacuumed , wiped anything down , the leather , glass or panels , dash and so on .
At no point did anyone try to make my experience right .
No food means it 's also dog friendly , which is also totally awesome !
Give it a try and you will not be disappointed .
No complaints .
Sadly for me , the white magick was not available due to some issues with the white peppercorns .
And if you like belgian style beers and some tasty ipas , voodoo will not disappoint .
I forgot her name that 's how much i did not care for her , she was nice at first but then she messed up my order by bringing me my appetizer with my entree .
If she was not sure if i wanted it with my meal she could have asked but she did not say anything and it 's not my job to tell her because it 's common sense that the appetizer must come before the meal .
Nevertheless , after that she proceeds to tell me not to be rude with her when i was n't .
I was just making a point and told her i do not need the appetizer now that the entree has arrived along with the appetizer .
And to top it all off , the rest of the night she did not come back to my table to ask how everything was .
I will never go back to that jack astor 's .
I asked but he never answered my question straight , he only responded with questions like " are you sure that 's what it is ?
Maybe it 's the battery or something else " and i am like " i do not think so , i believe it 's the alternator " , so when i thought he was giving me an estimate for how much it would cost .
It was not what i thought at all , he ended up running a full diagnostic without my permission and when i had to sign for $ 616 worth of repairs on my van i decided to ask him not to go through with it because it was too expensive .
I did not ask for a diagnostic i only wanted to repair my alternator , " so i told him i am not paying for it because i already knew i had a bad alternator .
I do not need to be charged $ 95 for you to tell me i have a bad alternator when i am the one telling you i have a bad alternator / " yup " he responds as a hustler would say with no respect for others , " you have a bad alternator that will be $ 95 " , with no repairs done to my car , i am like " i do not have to pay " i already knew i had a bad alternator and i did not ask for a diagnostic , so i called the cops !
" it 's illegal for you to charge me for work i did not request " ( he laughed with his cocky rude rude comments and assumptions , because he knew the results in the end was for me to pay him . )
" i am not going to pay you $ 95 for you to tell me what i already knew , " i said .
Then he decided to hold my car keys and said i could not have my keys until i pay $ 95 for a diagnostic that he bullied me into signing .
Bullying with his words because of his over confidence he did not ever listen when i asked him from the very beginning on what i needed done to the car when i first asked him .
Instead he bullied me into the diagnostic because he knew what he was doing from the beginning , manipulating me into paying him for work i already knew about which is why i came there in the first place , but he did not care about my needs , only the hustle .
Maybe he won today because he does this every day but his foul play was ill and needed to be shared , do not go here !
Do not trust this shop especially jim the guy who 's in charge , the job position has gone to his head , he rips people off and takes advantage of single hard working moms .
He has no guilt or shame for his dishonest actions !!!!!
Do not have your car worked on here !!!!!
This company has no concern with how i was wrongfully charged for work i never requested due to poor listening skills from their manager who bullied our conversation .
I had to ask permission to speak about my own car because he was so busy making assumptions and never listening .
The so called comment from this company pretending to be concerned is fake , i responded to them and never heard back from them and never got a refund for my $ 95 !!!!
Do not go here , they are liars !!
Never had an issue connecting or staying connected .
( speaking of sexy , this is not a room that you 'd share with someone you are uncomfortable with .
The bathroom as a whole is not a separate entity and though the shower has wavy glass , you can still totally see silhouettes through it . )
I do not believe there 's a way that anyone who is not staying at the hotel is able to get onto any floor outside of the lobby and basement .
Maybe put them in the very fancy ice bucket so they are not in plain view ?
There is no desk in the room .
When i did not answer they called my room .
I know that every guest is not a good guest but it was super annoying .
Not the hotel 's fault and i know you risk things like this when there is a bar and nightclub on site .
Did not experience so can not comment on : adega , room service , bar , nightclub , rooftop , dog park , gym .
Champagne upon check in was a nice touch . 1 star subtracted for the little things that need touching up -- lightbulbs in room burnt out ; window leaked during a storm ; no water in the room .
Not sure what changed but the last two times have have been a disappointment .
No matter how many times i ask them to come back for a spot they missed , i drve away work a semi clean cat .
It definitely does not beat panda express , but it will do for late night food !
Not only did she check us in early but upgraded our room .
Only complaint - we did not have much time to explore amenities at the hotel .
We visited the rooftop bar after dinner but did not have time for anything else .
When i first walked in on a saturday at 7 pm , i was kind of surprised it was not that busy .
We had reservations but apparently they were not needed .
Seemed like two managers were there and obviously did not care .
The food was good and the drinks were okay but not for the price .
Not sure i will be back .
When we picked it up it was seriously no cleaner than before , and my windshield never got fixed .
My windshield never got fixed again !
These guys should not be in business and no one should believe what the website says .
Just do not go here .
Not these !
I tried one ( did not die but i am not a fan ) .
My husband 's roll had a few pieces of lobster shell in it that he picked out but mine did not .
Neither of us particularly loved our sides ( he got fries , i got chips ) , but we were so full from the poke nachos that it did not really matter .
Sadly , no fire - burps .
Not too stuffy , but has the polish of a well - managed restaurant .
Can not wait to come back !
I was not sure what to order , so i checked yelp for an idea !
No glitz , no frills , just an authentic , real , and delicious experience .
We came here specifically to find this delicacy , and were not disappointed in the least .
I did not want to leave .... definitely will have to go back in the spring summer when the roof top is open .
Got here at 5:45 and wanted to get my car washed , but no one would help me .
Never disappointed .
You will not be disappointed !
This is a hip , cool , trendy hotel , not a practical use of space or place to get any work done at .
Got to call elevators with touch screen before you get into the elevator , then once inside , no buttons and can not change a destination or goto another floor .
- no desk .
- shower is in the center of the room and not sealed off from anything ...
Also no privacy if you are sharing rooms .
Just not a good use of space ...
I got my oil changed on saturday and i could not be anymore pleased .
I especially thank the front desk guy pat for being extremely nice , but also not being pushy in sales for some of the minor problems i needed to fix my car .
Even if you do not like beer , you need to come see the interior of this place .
Right now there is not food available at the brew pub , but food trucks often come by and you are welcome to get takeout from a nearby restaurant and bring it back .
Anyways , although it was not the best visit i have had at this location , i love the area and service is usually good so i will come back .
I would not object to staying here again , but do not think it 's worth $ 200 + . major bonus points for the awesome staff and outstandingly dog - friendly policies .
I stopped by with no appointment to have my a/c checked because it was not blowing cold and my poor kids were melting in the back seat .
Honestly there are no bad choices here .
I was invited to a welcome reception via email which was kind - i was not able to attend .
I was not exactly sure if it was a tooth off so i decided to have a professional to see if my hypothesis was correct so i asked them to check the timing .
Most mechanics are on a flat rate system which means you are paid on the jobs and not hourly , which is probably what they use .
Drawing to a conclusion they are crooks or incompetent and should not work on others vehicle .
Says he will call back never happened .
We checked into our dirty room and at 830 pm , and immediately received a noise complaint , which we were later told is because the rooms are for sleeping , not for talking and listening to music .
I could go on , but the point is do not stay here unless you want to sleep and quietly keep to yourself .
Apparently the bars and dancing are not for their guests , but for those who want to stay elsewhere .
Which could not be further from the truth .
Bottom line , do not go here if you are looking for a good time .
Portions are tiny and food is not fresh .
This place is overpriced as hell and simply do not know how to make poke .
Do not recommend , would not come back .
All in all pretty good experience and not disapointed in any way . :)
She came around on a regular basis to check on us to make sure we were okay and we never we nt long with out a drink .
I can not remember what song they danced to , but they were entertaining .
It 's not a place i would want to spend a lot of time as it is small and expensive , but for a drink or two , i would not mind coming back .
With an assortment of beers on top from voodoo , you can not go wrong .
The customer service was even better , when i ordered my beer , they just kicked the tap when the bartender opened up a bottle so i did not have to wait for a new one .
It was not our big night out so just 1 or 2 and off to bed .
I did not want to leave .
And their drinks were great and the prices were not that bad .
Again but no time .
I did not .
Perhaps serve it in a shallower dish and get the ratio better so i do not have nicely topped chips on top and a bunch of dry ones below ?
While the beers are not my tippy - top favorite of some of the new local breweries , the decor is awesome .
I would never stay here again ; this was probably one of the most disappointing hotel stays i have had .
For a place that has been talked up , it was a letdown : no refrigerator in the room , a pervy shower setup , and a generally cold and industrial feel to the entire place .
Not sure if they intentionally went for the fifty shades feel , but eww .
My girlfriend ordered the 3 item combo but that did not look very good .
They do not even take shortcuts on the kids ' dishes as things like chicken fingers are made in - house .
My friends had never been before and loved the cobb salad and soup , as well as the fact that their kids really enjoyed their meal .
If you do not have kids , this may understandably sound cheesy or unnecessary ; but if you are in my shoes , it was great to see the kids entertained and thrilled at all the tricks - for free no less .
In fact , most servers in other bars in the city ( read : not family friendly ) do not seem the feel the need to put out the vibe to the extent that they do here .
Tasting cristal was on our bucket list and this event did not disappoint .
Not ideal for business travelers - no desk and reeks of swingers club feel .
Sadly , i did not notice this until i had already picked through the breakfast .
Also , the english muffin is more of a dense bread - not light and fluffy if that 's what you are expecting .
I would not recommend this place unless you are coming to get laid or party .
It was small inside and we were a big group - but it worked out well on a thursday and we never felt rushed or crowded and we were there for a while .
I learned to clean my plate well not this time nor my wife ps. chowmein was oily and no flavor
The staff was nice and the flight of beer i had was good , but this was certainly not a kid friendly place .
The restaurant is not in a safe area .
We went to this place for lunch and i would not recommend anyone going in the evening .
I do not remember coming here , but obviously i did because i checked in and there were containers in my room the following morning full of loco moco and teriyaki beef . :)
Not great , but not bad .
I vaguely remember them heating up food in the microwave for people in front of me , which would usually turn me off , but at the time , i did not really care .
Now with the addition of the foodoo food truck outside you absolutely can not go wrong here .
I gave it a 3 because bathroom and shower made of glass doors that do not seal completely .
No privacy .
No coffee in the rooms .
Let me start off by saying that they just lost a potential huge corporate client due to their overly sexualized and tacky decor . - this is not a place to bring families - this is not a place to put up any business clients or anyone you would actually like to make eye contact with in the future - this is a good place if you want to play out a 50 shades of gray fantasy what is so terrible about the room ?
I was sharing the room with my wife so privacy was not an issue , however if i was sharing the room with say , my sister or friend i would be mortified to take a shower ( which is mostly seethrough ) horrible decor aside the bed was not all that comfy , water glasses did not have plastic or anything else on it to prove that it was clean , and there was not a coffee machine in the room .
Mashed potatoes were good , but i am not a fan of green onions and there were a bunch of it mixed in .
I tend to stick with ipas , they did not disappoint .
My daughter did not really like her kids pasta - the tomato sauce was too spicy for her .
We decided to send it back ; that 's right my 2 year sent her first meal back ( she 's gon na be yelp elite in no time ) .
It was not very crowded so we cozied up to the bar and kick started our night .
There were actually half circle lounge seating along the perimeter of the place that seemed cool and comfy chill areas , but they were all taken by the time we realized they were not vip . the music vibe was energetic and the bartenders punctuated this when they got onto the bar top and strutted their choreographed dance routines .
Well hell , is not that what everyone eventually aspires to do in vegas ?
If you are in the area , you ca n't miss this place .
This is a pretty good place to go for a drink or two but not much more than that .
I am surprised the carwash did not come with a spritz or two of air freshener .
The drinks seem pricey , did not try any of the signature cocktails .
The vibe is pretty mellow and the music is not too loud .
Do not expect tiger prawn sizes for that price .
Went here at about 9 pm on a friday and it was not busy at all ( which surprised me ) .
Only complaint is that it was a cold night and they did not put down the two huge garage doors that essentially make up one of the walls until about 10 pm so you may want to bring a jacket !
Our " reserved room " is really small , claims to fit 4 people .. def would not .. not to mention that the shower is in the middle of the room ..
Our " reserved room " is really small , claims to fit 4 people .. def would not .. not to mention that the shower is in the middle of the room ..
There is no privacy .
Looks like a shower in the morning is not happening with my friend and brother in law in the same room .
Def not happy with this room
Do yourself a favor an do not be lazy .. find a meal worth your time . :)
After reading several bad reviews i would not put this past them .
My car would not start at all .
I called meineke and jim , the guy on the phone , was not very customer oriented asked if " when i normally go in to get work done on my car do people mess with other things to mess it up ? " what kind of question is that !!?
I told him i will figure it out and he responds " awesome sauce ! " never again using meineke for anything !
Fun atmosphere / not well thought out ergonomically .
No coffee maker in the rooms , no robes - for the price these should come standard .
Not kid- friendly .
We walked into this restaurant with just over an hour to spare , as we were going to the cinema afterwards and had not eaten any dinner yet ..
The only reason i gave a 4 / 5 stars was because my sauce in my dish was spicy and it probably would not be noticed by some , but i hate spicy food so i did not enjoy the dish as much as i 'd have liked , and plus there was no spice in the description on the menu so .. otherwise no complaints , staff were lovely , food was great and we got dinner and our movie without throwing the food down our necks !

So i stopped by today and they told me they did not have time , but if i really wanted to , i could leave it and pick it up at 5 .
I went from not ever returning to a happy customer .
I am glad i have finally found a good carwash in arizona and can not wait to return !
I arrived early ( 8 pm ) because i had not pre-purchased a ticket for the party which was said to be sold out .
They did not have one of the ingredients for the coffee drink i wanted to order , so it was suggested i consider a chocolate martini , which i did .
My only qualm was that this drink was $ 3 more than the coffee drink i wanted to order , and i was not told about this ahead of time .
Not a big deal obviously , but still it would have been nice to know prior to ordering .
It just was not good .
Not rude , just inept .
There was not much fish , mostly filler .
Obviously , i am not thinking " healthy " when i order anything that has the term " nachos " in it .
Alas ... no server was present after waiting for 20 minutes .
What we ordered last night : - sweet and sour chicken ( sauce on the side ) - i did not like the taste and it looked weird .
- spam musubi - basic spam musubi that no one finished .
There was not a long wait and the drunks were happy .
It 's not too busy surprisingly at this time .
Great service from the bartenders , i did not wait long for my drinks .
I do not know how to give a star rating on this location , i was in between 2 - 3 stars but since more then half of the times i have gone to this location are horrific , i think a 2 star is being generous .
Absolutely everything came out wrong , so backwards you would not believe and the place was barely busy .. asked for the mushrooms on the side , of course they came on the steak and the fried onions were put on the side instead .
I personally would not have got the mushrooms at all but the boyfriend likes them and ordered the same steak so he wanted my mushrooms , no problem for me as long as they are nowhere near my food !
Umm , no thinks i think i will pass and do not even bother getting it put back on the grill because it will still come out wrong !
I usually never want to get my food re-made because it will always be cooked rushed , even when you tell them not to rush it because you just want it right , like it should have been the first time .
Of course the steak came out like a hockey pock the second time around and we ended up not having dinner and just cutting our loses ... you can take your chance , but 9 times out of 10 it will be wrong .. oh hey , they are coming out with yet another menu change on the 20th of this month ( october 2015 ) and are removing more of the popular items like the steak fajita after finally switching back to flank steak from sirloin ( who wants a sirloin fajita ? )
She ( i did not get her name ) offered to get me some payne from the kitchen .
Not only did they bring that but also some sliced bananas .
This may not sound like much to most of you but it was huge to me .
I did not stay here but if this treatment is a taste of the service i will be back to stay the night .
I do not know if they are under new management because they have now become the epitome of fraud and overcharging .
I already knew what was wrong with it but did not feel like fixing it myself .
Shocker , no more problems .
Full disclosure - i did not stay at the hotel , but i did run an upscale event .
Peel back the cover and things are not so great .
Cold catered food ( not good when it 's a slider bar ) delivered 1 / 2 hour early , total miscommunication ( maybe no communication ) between staff you interact with .
I am guessing their back office is either underfunded or not important to them .
They said no one at the hotel told them there was an event going on and were not going to move .
Add in no signage keeping random guests from wandering into our event and it all left a sour taste in my mouth .
Luckily the hotel looks great and since my guests were not eating or staying there they gave high marks overall .
Sorry to sound so negative - it really is a gorgeous hotel and i hope it is not a victim of all these issues .
Chris was very helpful and did not try to upsale me things i did not need .
I liked the h2 p a touch better but could not quite place my finger on why .
I went on a thursday evening so it probably was not their busiest night , but all the bar seats and tables closest to the bar were full and a good crowd was gathered at the other tables for the band that was playing .
They do not serve food , but i hear the original brewery in meadville does , so i am hoping that will change soon !
We were ordering to go and there was absolutely nowhere to stand not a designated section for people to wait for their to go orders .
I could not sleep at all due to the light / noise .
I did not want to leave .... definitely will have to go back in the spring summer when the roof top is open .
" well i do not have that kind of cash right now so i will have to think about this , " i tell him .
I know it s silly but i am no mechanic so i rely on others to be honest with me .
First time trying this cuisine although i did not get a poke bowl .
Not knowing what to expect i just wanted an outside wash to see how well they did with the idea if it was good i would be back .
I could have gone to one of their sister washes that is closer to the house and hand a hand wash for the same amount but guess there is still no guarantee it would be any better .
No one seems to take pride in what they do anymore .
Not sure how to pronounce " poke " - but heard it was a thing so my wife and i came here for lunch today .
No listed prices anywhere we could see and paid $ 7.00 and $ 7.50 for two local beer cans .
I expect that pricing at a concert or sporting event , not for a quick lunch .
Also it 's not cool to have kids running around as if it is a playpen .
I wish to add that the employees were nice and were not rude in any way and apologized for the unnecessary long wait
That made no sense at all .
I love poke and i am sorry to say that this was not good .
The place was pretty but the vibe unfortunately was not good and neither was the food .
I do not know much about cars and when i ask they explain until i understand without frustration .
Please ask the staff to wear black pants and not denim while serving .
We were a little disappointed yesterday that the tap was not working and that brew was not available , but hey .. it happens .
Food is not great here , usually cold / luke warm at this location in general astors food has been getting worst too bad
We came here around 7 on a saturday night , and there was no wait .
The vibe is a true new england fish market , but a modern no - frills hip take on it .
The seaweed is not your normal seaweed , and is a perfect touch .
Last , but not least , the lobster roll .
So when i tell you i have had more lobster rolls in my life than most people have had glasses of water , i am not kidding .
The lobster they use is not over cooked or over - steamed , which happens a lot unfortunately .
It 's not oversoaked in mayo or huge chunks of celery ... it 's light and fresh .
This new spot is no amateur hour , and is the product of what is obviously a lot of careful and deliberate planning from its owners .
Check it out asap , you will not be sorry .
It was so sweet and scrumptious , it took a valiant effort on my part to not drink more than a taster of it .
Boyfriend lives across the street and if i was not obsessed with him already , i 'd probably still stick around just so we could continue hitting up this joint every weekend .
I can not move past the signature shrimp bowl , but i have ventured out to try the waygu steak bowl as well as the wonton nachos .
Nachos are probably / definitely not gluten free and man , did i regret it later ; however , they were so good , i can not promise that i will never order and suffer again .
Yummy , fresh shrimp , surrounded by pineapple and spices and vegetables , and i smother the whole thing in their kuzu lime sauce and i just really can not imagine myself happier than i am when i am eating that thing .
Stop making the food so damn good if you do not want to see our faces !
Did not get to the club , the vault , or restaurant , adega , because of our short stay , but look forward to trying them out next time .
The room was awesome and the service could not be any better .
Jim was affable , communicative , proactive and not condescending in any perceivable way .
$ 20 a pop and even $ 10 for a mini size bottle of water because they will not serve you plain iced tap water .
You are not going to find anything cheap in vegas unless you are sitting at a table or slot machine and waiting for the cocktail ladies to come by and then you tip her for her courteous delivery of your drink .
Why not use that extra money and put it on # 00 at the roulette tables ?
I did not hate it .. but , if i am being honest i was not super impressed either .
I did not hate it .. but , if i am being honest i was not super impressed either .
( however i do not think they provide this on there typical menu . ) seating is extremely crowded and odd .
The food is pretty pricing , and really just was not up to par ( taste wise - presentation was good lol ) .
The whole restaurant was not busy so they could have provided better service and comfort .
We had to go to another table for our plates and the waitress did not ask for water refills . meh : (
This probably does not match up to it .
The chicken fingers were not seasoned , sauce was sooo limey .
Calimari was not good either .
I do not think they season anything .
No seasoning what so ever .
Was not worth the $ 17 tiny pasta .
Newsflash ..... just because tip is already included does n't mean you can give us shit service .
They did not even give us back the unused candles , they kept it until i asked where it was .
My friend asked why they did not stick 20 candles in and the waitress said , " we just did not have time " um your restaurant is empty ... all in all manager sucks , waitresses suck , service is beyond slow , food is unflavored , drinks are watered down .
So i hit a curb ( this is a regular occurance i do not know why ) and i needed to get a front end alignment so i thought .
No , not sweet .
They gave me an estimate of $ 1400 ( no effing way ) and said that my car was basically going to explode on me if i do not get the 4 things i needed fixed .
Needless to say i did not have $ 1400 on me , or even the " minimum " amount of what they were going to do which was $ 600 .
Those a* * holes have no idea what they are doing . : " he then proceeded to show me every part on my car that meineke said was " so totally badly and completely damaged and unsafe " and they were all fine .
No need to replace .
Anyway i just want everyone to know to never ever ever ever ever in your life use this meineke , they will try to get you to spend unnecessary money !
Took it in an the manager / worker put it on the lift , put the tailpipe back on the hanger and it was not bent as bad as i thought .... manager did not charge me a dime .

High quality service , a teeny not pricey but you definitely get what you pay for and that 's quality service .
I legit felt a sense of class i never have walking down the hallway in our hotel room ... in the room .
It came off surprisingly easy which just made me mad that maybe the restaurant gods did not want me to eat it .
It seemed like the cashier ( although she was great , patient , friendly , and kind ) did not really know what she was doing .
Not good for groups of 4 or more .
I did not stay at the hotel but i did come here for a cd release at the alex theatre and had a meal here .
As a tip valet parking is expensive so if possible do not bring a car or park elsewhere .
Mind you my interior is never that dirty , my car only has 2500 miles so this should not be a difficult task .
For a quick light snack , who could not want a spam musubi ?
We were starving at about 4 am and it did not look like we had too many choices .
During late night , they do not serve chinese food .
We went with the scrambled eggs since they had a big tray of those so we would not have to wait for eggs .
It did not look like anything special , but it tasted a lot better than it looked .
I do not go to vegas often but when i go here , i am always remembered .
Then they got a food truck and no longer allow pets .
Not a fan of ipa's and seems like a lot of their beers are overly hoppy .
Jim explained to me that i did not need brakes at all .
This was an amazing overall feeling knowing that i did not have to replace my brakes .
It was also comforting to know that meineke did not try to fix something that did not need fixing .
Walked in at 5:38 , walked out at 5:52 .. no server came to our table with many walking about attending to other tables .
Not recommended ..
It was not super crowded but had a great upbeat feel .
Please save your time , money and do not go to this place !!!
So i came here because i did not want the hassle to go to my dealership and drive an extra 15 minutes ... big mistake !! ,
I parked in front of one of the open doors thinking somebody will approach me since i have an appointment and they do not seem busy ... they did not !
Instead i hear this car behind me honking like the world is about to end , i am assuming he is honking because he is trying to get in , i am thinking he is a customer thinking i am trying to take his spot but no it was an employee !
He kept honking for about 3 minutes , let me add the fact that my husband is behind me and is a disable veteran , this kind of loud noises do not bring good memories to him so of course this did not set well with him , we go inside to tell whoever is there about what happened and he proceeds to say " who parks in an open door blocking the entrance and this is not a quick shop that we should go to a cheap quick lube and all non sense stuff while raising his voice " at this point i am just speechless that instead of offering an apology about the lack of costumer service of his people he decided to insult us and denigrate small shops , and yeah i should have gone to a small quick lube because i am sure anywhere else is better than the " service " they can provide .
The shrimp was not overdressed in too much mayo and spices .
The bread was lightly toasted with a bit of butter so it was not greasy .
I will never come back to this place .
I went here with my coworkers and they sat us by the pathway and each of the servers who passed by had no consideration whatsoever and kept bumping on my chair .
When i told one of the servers to tell the others to be careful , one of the servers girl just said " well this is the pathway for the servers , we can not do anything " and walk away .
And one of the guy servers also was no help and added on top " it 's our pathway " and walk away as well .
All the other servers also just stood on one side and looked at me while gossiping i can not believe it .
If i were not there with my coworkers i would have left already !
I have never seen a hotel that is so over the top with the customer service .
I have never been so blown away with customer service ( and i work in a 5 star hotel myself ) they have not even checked in yet and i already am forever in love with this property .
Watching a leafs game here is not the greatest .
The tv's are small and the game is not usually aired with sound unless you sit closer to the bar .
They are decent , but nothing i have not had a better version of somewhere else in the gta .
Not only that the place was empty , boring , and obviously the bartender was rude .
Everything was lacking flavor , including the musubi which was not marinated at all ... but still i was pretty into it .
I was not even drinking ...
They do not charge you and arms and a leg for loading up your bowl either !
The tuna nachos looked amazing even though we did not try them .
I have never had either before , but i thought they were decently priced ( $ 5 and $ 10 , respectively ) while still filling me up , standing up to my beers , and putting me in a warm , comfort zone of food coma .
I had asked for no onions in my food which was okey by the waitress and as my food arrived it had onions but replaced 20 mins later .
Id give it 2 1 / 2 stars but it does not allow it .
She was very accommodating to our shellfish , nut , and soy allergy at the table , so we knew which bowls and sauces not to use .
Do not get me wrong , i love sticky rice , congee and all but did not care for the taste / texture of the milky rice base .
Not sure how it gets when it 's super busy but i am willing to go again .
And from what i understand you can not really get it anywhere else ( hardly ) and definitely not in bottles .
It 's not your typical club or anything , it 's definitely just a bar , but the bartenders make it so fun !
I did not know what i was ordering when i picked it , i just * instinctively * chose the first thing on the menu that caught my eye .
Do not forget to ask about their happy hour specials if you are drinking mid-day !
Turns out it was their famous oxtail soup , do not miss out on this no matter what you might think .
Never had one bad thing .
I had shoddy brakes that were squeaking like crazy and not only did they repair it , they explained how breaking too fast can wear them quicker and how the extreme cold to the extreme heat can greatly effect the way they wear .
Jim marco not only helped me understand the basics of brakes he explained how keeping bad brakes is super dangerous !
I am a young women newer to vegas so it was nice going into a auto body place and felt like i was not being ripped off and got the professional opinions and services i went there for .
Cons : - no coffee or hot water kettle in the rooms .
- no room in the mini fridge for guests to use .
Overall , i am not certain that i would stay here again .
I had heard about it and wanted to check it out but never found myself in the neighborhood before when it was convenient .
There are not big signs outside , just a subtle " vd " on the door , so it could be easy to miss !
There were not any tv 's and they do not have a kitchen ( at this point in time ) , but there was a catering company that had sauerkraut and sausage sandwiches .
The voodoo love child does not taste like 11 % at all either , which can be dangerous , lol .
2.5 stars - decent drinks , not too expensive for the location .
Nice atmosphere but no bar snacks ( what is it with las vegas and the lack of bar snacks ?! ) .
It 's a great option if you can not decide what you want !
The met does not disappoint .
And for being in downtown cleveland the rates are not too bad .
Not geared towards business travelers the rooms do not have desks so you will be using your laptop on your laptop .
They did not try to upsell .
Honestly for a chain restaurant it was not too bad .
Before if you told me that dinner was a jack 's i would groan , now i do not mind as much .
When it does not change !!
I did not want to pay twice for the same obvious condition .
Decided to not go to my car dealer anymore for my oil change because they took too long .
So no , not really a favorite place to hang in vegas .
A milk stout infused with chocolate and oatmeal hints but not too filling although it tasted like a yummy chocolate milkshake .
At a whopping 8.5 % alcohol content be careful not to drink too many of these unless of course you brought a designated driver .
I can not comment on the food selection as my belly was reserved for all beer on this particular day .
Classic games such as clue , scrabble , checkers , yahtzee , and candy land were offered for play if the mood so struck be sure to take a friend who knows how to have a good time like bj a and i and your day / night can not go wrong .
Definitely can not wait to return !!!
I went in the office and was greeted by no one for a good fifteen minutes .
When someone finally came by , i asked , " is that car ready ? " , he told me it had not even gone in yet .
He tried to make it good by giving me $ 20 off an already overpriced oil change , so i was not all that impressed .
I asked him why it took them an hour and fifteen minutes past my scheduled appointment to even get my car in the garage and he blamed it on " internal problems with our mechanics . " he then had the mechanics rush through my car 's oil change and check - up , i would say the whole process took about 4 minutes , which did not make me feel all that confident they were putting any care into my car .
Taps not working properly and staff seemed a bit baffled .
The wait staff was so friendly and my glass was never empty .
If you still can not find it , it 's in the same area as level up and the bridge from nyny / tropicana .
Had a hard time trying to find it , but hopefully you guys do not !
Can not wait to try lobster roll , on a bed of greens for me , on special every monday .
I have been taking my company car here for the last 4 years and have never left disappointed .
While the hotel is nice and people are friendly my point of view is based on the fact that a simple situation happened that should not have occurred .
So yes a do not disturb sign was out till then .
When we would return to our room at 6:00 pm our room still did not have housekeeping service .
While this may not be a big deal for some it is not something we were used to in this type of hotel .
We wanted to return to our room for a rest with no thought which is the point of a vacation .
Me and my wife are not divas so if that is their way of operating just let us know up front and we will pick another place .
I do not know what it 's like during the evening , but what a great place to hang out during the day !
I recently had bad service experience at the bar and the manager did not help at all .
I saw other customers had bad experience but i did not know the details but after what i experienced , i feel bad for them too .
I am not going to go there anymore because i feel it will be a waste of money .
People who will not like this hotel : business travelers .
I get that this is an " urban " hotel but i was not super impressed with the fact that all of the hotel employees were wearing plain clothes , except the valet .
Not super convenient .
The room itself is ok , except it does not have a desk .
After my car was complete the outside was decent , you could not even tell the seats had been shampooed , and it did not look like they did a great job wiping down the interior .
Ummm , no i do not .
Just cause i have boobs does not mean you get to upsell me .
Some boob owners happen to be mechanics who only come here because they are not allowed to do oil changes at their apartment complex .
I came here for a dinner date , and luckily there was no wait for 2 !
I , who was so caught up on pokemon , did not even look at the menu yet , so i let my date order before me .
I did not want a big dinner .
Do not hesitate to bring your car here for service .
I had a not very memorable experience with bad nachos , as they were stale , bland , jalapeno free ( i thought they were green bell peppers ! ) and also lacking in cheese and flavor .
As an avid lover of spicy food , i am very pleasantly surprised to say nachos do not have to be fiery and spicy to be tasty !
Jojo allowed the same friend , my husband to join me for lunch there on sunday immediately following the incident and fed us not only delectable chicken quesadilla and the oh - so - worth the calories , totally scrumptious trademark jack astor garlic cheese pan bread , which is famous for a reason , but he insisted i try the nachos again this time with fresh tortilla chips and enough cheese to open up its own factory !
Yes they use fresh jalapenos which are not a spicy as the jarred variety but it did not matter because the flavor and care in the preparation made these rival and surpassed the keg which was my previous contender for best nachos .
We do not have any equipment that touches the vehicle inside our tunnel .
I did not go to this location because it 's inexpensive , i went to this location because i thought i was going to get a hand wash .
Of those i have been to this is at the top level of craft brewing in my opinion , but i can not say there is too much that sets it apart from the rest .
The beer is not brewed on premises from what i can tell but still great .
He said it will be 4 or 5 hours , i said that 's fine , i do not mind waiting .
He said may not even be today .
Again i do not mind waiting .
Why not offer to make me an appointment so i could come back instead of rudely turning me away .
It was a very small portion of lobster and was not mixed with the other ingredients .
The roll itself was small and did not seem to have been buttered or heated .
I got ' black listed ' by robert who is the owner / manager because i asked for a refund on services i paid for but did not receive .
The place was not busy .
Closed but no sign saying that .
I feel confident in the work and will not go anywhere else .
After attending the second day of lib ( life if beautiful festival ) we were starving the three of us did not quite know what to eat since almost every restaurant on fremont street was either packed to the walls or there was a long wait to get a table .
It was not to busy .
People of yelp , whatever you do ... do not get the sauce !
The only thing i can report about our little adventure is that the three of us did not get food poisoning !
Not open until 7 am !!!
I dk when they close , i just know that they were not open at 630 on a tuesday when i stopped by and they looked like they had been closed for a while .
Classic car spa was my favorite car wash till now , it is now cobblestone .. which i hate ... i had to have guy redo and wipe down all things that were left filthy , for 29.00 car wash this should never happen ...... i will not come here ever again ...
Classic car spa was my favorite car wash till now , it is now cobblestone .. which i hate ... i had to have guy redo and wipe down all things that were left filthy , for 29.00 car wash this should never happen ...... i will not come here ever again ...
No cobblestone ...
I was treated well and did not have to be up sold over and over again because it was already included in the supreme wash .
Bed pretty good and far better then the last series of marriotts we have stayed at . pillows ok water pressure not great - maybe because of the rain shower no coffee in room but free coffee in the morning at the lobby .
No need to drive
If i could give this no star at all i would !
When i first called the hotel the person said i needed to talk to someone else and they gave me a number , that person said they could not help me , i needed to talk to the hotel .
I have been hung up on , told i was going to receive folios and they never arrive .
Finally talked to the manager and she sent me the folios , but one was duplicate and now i am on hold again for currently nearly 10 minutes and counting ( very common for this hotel no matter what you want to do ! ) .
I will never stay here nor will i ever send one of our guests here .
I do not know much about cars and i know most mechanics are scammers but at least do the job good !!
It 's not sensitive at all and feels like they did not even do anything at all .
I am upset they did not even do a good job , i do not even feel safe driving my car so i took it to a different place that will not screw me over .
Do not go here !!
Meinke is such a joke , i have no problem paying just do not fuck me over and do a shit job !
It was filling , but not too much ( especially scone i had mostly fruit and veggies ) .
The crispy tofu was better than most and did not seem greasy .
I can not wait to take my husband here for the lobstah ( new england way of saying it ) roll .
I do not think you could go wrong with the menu options or something you create yourself .
I left the restaurant feeling like i did not eat at all .
It 's probably because they want to cover smell of the fish that s not fresh ?
Maybe they think most people that come here do not know the concept of poke and therefore will be fooled into buying their vastly overpriced disgusting tasting food ??
Obvioisly not parts and labor .
I will never be back .
I was never called me when my car was done , and there was dried soap on the wheels , the coffee spills on the dash were still there , vacuum job was terrible , mirrors and chrome spotty but worst of all they scratched the tint on the inside of the window and would not take responsibility for it .
Sure enough , the portion of oxtail was so generous and the broth was rich and tasty , packed with shiitake mushroom , peanut and not to forget the cilantro .
2 cars in the bays and no other cars in the parking lot .
I inquired about a quick oil change since they were not busy .
Manager proceeds to inform me i can drop it off and they would work it in at some point during the day , but no way they could get to my truck right now because they were booked up .
But would not you know my light is off now because i got the oil changed .
You will not regret it .
I am not mad about it .
Drinks are not spectacular yet strong !
I come her every other month and will not go anywhere else !
I have not had a problem with the service yet and i have been there countless of times over the years .
Do not go for the pastas ... they taste very bland .
Not much too it but it 's jack 's so i would not really expect pasta to taste anything out of this world .
I had heard about the 99 cent shrimp cocktails at this place for a long time now but had never gone to try it .
The shrimp was so overpowered by the sauce i could not even taste the shrimp .
If you plan to go , ask the woman not to add more sauce to the already sauced cocktail .
I would not eat the chinese here -- and it 's only okay to just grab a snack .
Do not plan on having a meal , you will be disappointed .
And there is no desk to work at in the room , which is a bit of a hassle if you are traveling for business .
The fitness center is located on the floor above the lobby but there are not any guestrooms on that floor and the door was not locked ( there was a pad to swipe your guest room key but it was not functioning and the door was open so hopefully they can get that fixed ) , which made me a little bit nervous being in there alone .
It 's something i will not forget .
Typical jack 's , no matter which location you go to .
If you can not handle spicy , this is not for you .
It 's a bit more expensive than most places considering the food ( and 3 chicken strips ) and the food and service is not special .
Not much wait for a table .
The staff did not seem to care .
I can not believe how rude the bartender was !!!
I do not think he even asks me what i want but more so stares at me until i order .
I am not expecting a birthday committee to come and sing me happy birthday but holy hell , just a simple smile and " happy birthday " would suffice .
People are creating memories here and that moment of my first drink can not ever be replicated .
I told her to not call back after i sent the food down and she continued calling anyways as if my request did not apply to her .
Wether you are a ceo , a bum or lebron no one should be talked down to .
Never coming back here ever .
Not too bad .
Anyway , beer was good , i only had 1 ip a but i liked the fact that it was actually hoppy and not bogged down with that heavy sickening sweet malty flavor most breweries around here offer in their " ipa's " no complaints really other than the dismal inconvenient location .
I will go back and get some growlers filled soon with their ipa ( s ) i just would not linger around the brewery after the sun goes down .
I thought it was good , i do not know if i would get it again -- but that is simply off of personal preference .
I may try to build my own bowl and see if that makes a difference , i just did not enjoy the seaweed salad in the bowl with some of the other ingredients .
When we finally picked up the car we did not get much of a discount for the inconvenience .
We could not drive the car .
I rate it three stars and not a 1 for all the troubles because they actually did try to help fix the situation .
They try to tell us it was a problem that did not have to do with the work they did .
Our waitress / bartender was very friendly and we never felt like we could not flag someone down if we were thirsty .
Oh. the place is not packed at all .
Except that there is no smoke .
You do not like our music ? "
Unplug it like any normal person would do because there 's obviously no f@# ( *!g smoke . " yes .
Most of the time i come here they do an average job , never a good job .
Typically the windows are covered in a film but the body is not to bad .
The entire body did not even look like it had been sprayed with water .
The supervisor was right there and did not even bother to apologize for the poor job that was done .
The movie theatre is not for kids under 19 because the theatre caters to adults . ie - regular bar for night life entertainment .
Having had it 4 nights earlier i really was not looking forward to it .
It was not that good .
It was not salty enough as saturday , and the carrots , etc. , were not cooked long enough .
Some of the oxtail were chewy as the meat did not fall off the bone .
Not to mention , the fat was not trimmed at all .
My hawaiian friend has been telling me about fremonts competing oxtail for months but i have never dared diverge from the old reliable .
The oxtail was not too bad .
I did not bother to try it .
( just as well , i will not get a ss check when i retire anyway .
No need for the early practice . ) aside from a smallish bowl , plastic , and lacking the magic ingredient of ginger , the broth was tasty and the oxtails were generous .
If you do not want to wait until 11 pm , this is a viable alternative .
It 's not a restaurant environment like california so it 's weird eating it amongst the hot dog eaters .
Not deserving of their thoughtfulness , we trudged to the dunkin do nut side and planted our tookishes on there .
So all in all , it was not a horrible alternative .
No surprise , however , since their original location needed to expand .
You are not going to get any food here , so plan accordingly .
With three kids under four in tow and a promise of quick service , we went inside , only to be told 1 / 2 hour later that the lube guy was on a break and they had not even started .
If there had been anyone ahead of me in line , i would not have gone .
If someone lies to get me in i do not want to know what else they will do to my car .
I will never go back .
I did not receive any response from anyone until 10:30 p.m. saturday night : my email to classic on friday 4/15 at 10:07 a.m. to whom it may concern , i got my car washed today at the 1555 w. warner rd. location .
I have used them many times before and have never had any issue .
Being in sales i do not begrudge anyone trying to up - sell their services .
However he paid no attention to my needs and seemed to be only concerned with his i.e. getting a bigger ticket .
According to alex , the manager , that was not even put on the ticket .
He lamented the fact that i did not get a manager while i was there .
I do not know what quality controls you have in place for your store but whatever they are , they are simply not working .
I do not have time or energy to try to " get it right " working with lackadaisical service .
I apologize for not meeting your expectations with your wash today .
He assured me that he apologized to you and offered to rewash the vehicle for you at any time you desire and remove the road tar from your vehicle that is not included in any wash we offer .
However , since you took your obviously valuable time to insult my employees on yelp.com by calling them monkeys , i will simply say that you are not welcome at any of my locations at any time .
In this case i can see why the customer was not served judging from the manager 's response .
As an aside i will say that road tar was not an issue on my car as he tried to indicate .
I will also say that i was not told that i could bring my car back anytime .
Alex tried to get me to bring my car immediately back in and when i could not he asked me what time i got off work .
He never told me that i could bring my car back in " anytime " and get a free wash .
I do not need to say anymore here folks .
The only ones that really work are the ones that come in the sealed cans ... all the other gel pads and stuff do not work well at all , so do not waste your money on anything but the cans !
I did not complain too much though because i prefer round tables over rectangles , so not a huge deal .
Not once has the dip been watery like soup , but for some reason , it was at shops at don mills .
I did not even bother eating it , so i just sent it back .
Even my broke interns did not want to eat it lol .
No more than 2 mins later , the manager came by and said " congratulations !
I try not to eat at jack 's unless i am looking to get day drunk on their mixed drinks because the food is not that great unless your senses are compromised .
Although the food was not great , the service was amazing and i will def be back to bring my next batch of interns for their goodbye luncheon .
If i remembered the manager 's name , i would have posted it here , but i do not .
Did not want to write this one but decided i should .
I was not given a " place card " when i ordered but did not realize i needed it .
After i got back to my home office and was preparing for a meeting i found that they did not include one of the items we ordered .
I did not forget it they did not give them to me .
Sorry , i am just a pet peeve about the customer is always right and you should never say anything to make them feel like they are wrong .
Especially when they are not wrong .
Theyvasked if i could come back which was not possible so then they said they would talk to their manager and i would have a credit next time i came .
No mandarin oranges no red cabbage .
See this bowl , they did not listen .
The reason it is 3 stars and not 2 is because the food was great .
You can not fix that customer experience after they walk out of the door so you have to guarantee the orders are accurate .
Fyi - i we nt early so it was not super slammed .
When you order a meal that comes with multiple items , you literally have to ask for the rest of your meal , when your combo comes with a drink , they do not give it to you , your have to tell them that you actually want your drink that you paid for .
When i questioned the cashier / server , she acted like my concern about being charged for someone else 's food was an inconvenience for her and would not make it right .
On a sanitary note , no gloves worn and they handle the money and make the food without washing their hands .
I mean for a buck i was not going to pass it up !!
I just moved to arizona and did not know my way around so i decided to go to here to get my car washed .
Dried soap still on the rear bumper and trunk lid glass was only cleaned from outside rear mats were placed on the wrong sides and were not secured they forgot to vacuum under rear mats there was weird smell after i got in the car .
Idk if it was dirty towels they used or their sweaty shirts personally i do not recommend this car wash .
On the other hand the staff is friendly and i have not had any other issues .
It was very busy as it was lunch time on a saturday , however the servers were not attentive : we were not asked how our meal was , tables were not cleared while new customers wandered around looking for seats ; all the while the server stood at the counter folding napkins with her back to the restaurant .
That said , can not wait to come back to grab sushi grade fish to go or enjoy their wide selection of oysters .
The fries were not special but the lobster more than made up for that .
Then he says oh he has you down for a brake flush you do not need that .
Do not give them business
So , after waiting for several weeks for a return call on when the repairs can be madei called and was informed that the parts would not be replaced .
They are not to be trusted with expensive vehicles . i would nt trust these people with my bycycle !
I was dying for a nice plate of fajitas but they came non-sizzling with the ( 5 small strips of ) chicken simultaneously overcooked and not warm -- how is that even possible ?
Probably they do not factor that in with the menu 's calorie counts .
My husband and i talk about hitide often because the potential is all there , but execution is flawed and the portions do not seem to matter when you order a small / regular vs large .
I stopped in yesterday for a takeout order , and the server / cashier at the counter was helpful but i was surprised to see i was being charged more for additions because i have not had hat previously .
The consistency is not there , and in a market where more and more poke places are popping up , consistency will be more necessary than ever .
Close to home .... but would never recommend .
Since i was sitting outside the whole time , i had a visual and told him that did not happen .
Asked for a refund and he could not do it because i had used a cc .... went inside , spoke to the manager who seemed to care less .
Told her i thought it was awful that no one apologized , just gave excuses .
I honestly do not even want to post because i do not want this place to be packed ... but then that 'd just be cruel to keep this place just for myself .
Yeah i know it 's not your typical restaurant ...
I will never be able to find a better coconut mojito than i have had here .
Last time i ordered the pierogies , they were good but there was a half of one , i thought it was mistake , but now i do not know .
I will not be giving them any more of my money .
The rooms seem to be retrofitted from an early era when not a hotel .
I have to say the beds are not very comfortable and there is no coffee machine in the rooms .
Electrical outlets not on both bedsides , pillows are super big -- the type that give you a stiff neck .
I would not consider this a luxury hotel , but the people are nice and the cleaning service staff works hard .
There is not a desk and the living area and bedrooms are together .
There is no way to call " housekeeping " nor is there any concierge services .
It 's nice to have someone not try to sell you unneeded repairs .
I did not let them oppress me .
Do not go there .
I have never had a seaweed salad like hi tide 's version .
I did not love it , i did not hate it .
I think it was an interesting flavor - worth trying - but , not something i would necessarily order again .
We both ordered large poke bowls ( they are not huge - i would recommend the large for an average sized meal ) .
After that all the drinks were on the house ( tanqueray gin not the house gin ) which was very nice .
They did an inspection so thoroughly they ended up replacing a fuel cap i did not even know was broken ( now it clicks ! ) .
First of all , let me say that this review is for service and not for the beer or food truck .
He told us that because of the food truck parked outside , we had to leave and could not eat our food inside .
Tell us that you can make an exception but that if we come in the future , to not bring food .
It 's a shame you can not find this on the strip !
I do not even know if slots o fun still has it .
Thanks but no thanks !
How can you not love a beer called voodoo love child ?!?
They were served with a horseradish sorbet , something i have never seen before and it was amazing .
I would not return here because of the service .
Mary ann if you are reading this , you need an attitude adjustment and a math course if you do not know how to take away $ 2.25 from $ 2.14 then girlllll , you need to go back to school stop letting the cash register do it for you .
The bar is a total dive , not a place you go for comfort .
Their regular everyday beers are not really very good .
Never happened .
Confusing is not it .
I am not a genius on car waxes , but i recall wax holding its glossy and protective structure a few months .
Was not a great deal , but was not bad , either .
The gas prices here are reasonable , but not a steal .
They do not get a whole lot of gas customer traffic , so they pass the costs onto you .
The wait is short and you do not have to wait long like the cal .
Can not even begin to say how disappointed i am .
The young man who greeted me was very personable but , i found out later , unfortunately not knowledgable about the products or services accessible to the customers .
Was told i would not believe how good my car would look and that the paint would feel as smooth as butter and that the build up that had accumulated over the last six months would be completely taken care of .
The paint has plenty of spots where it feels rough ( not from old damaged paint but from what they defined as overspray ) .
I am sure it was ... just not everywhere it needed - they were supposed to use only top of the line professional grade products from meguiar 's .
- it was not buffed enough or evenly .
So , you can still see the products they used , finger and hand prints , smudges and swirls . - the windows and mirrors were not cleaned with streaks or swirls free products or clean .
No such luck .
Was later told by supervisor , it could not be done because of safety reasons and injury prevention .
Is not it funny , i have done this clean up myself multiple times without any issue , damage physical or otherwise .
I could forego that detail if it were not for the cost and the statement of absolute quality like , , , " you would believe how good your car will look .
Just like the showroom . " - the cargo area cover was not cleaned ( not that it needed a lot of it to begin with ) .
Some product was put on it so that it no longer is gripping the cargo it suppose to hold in place .
Last but not least , i heard the manager say : " no tips ?!? '
Wow , i did not know one got tips based on poor performance .
Anyway , i would not recommend them for any type of service .
If $ 299.99 does not buy quality services then i can not imagine what less will ... too bad .
I do not believe the individuals that work on my car were trying to do a bad job .
They were either not trained properly or are only doing what is asked of them which is definitely not enough too meet expectations of showroom quality .
Not the place to host your wedding but as a place to get late night food to soak up cocktails this fits the bill .
Truthfully if you are picky not the place for you but not many casino cafes open w a full menu late night anymore .
The only flaw i saw was the toppings in the two bowls were slightly different and mine did not have the spicy sauce .
Btw .... i am not going to stand in a line of 20 + folks at the cal at 1 am in the morning for their oxtail soup .... they probably are retired and gambling .... me , i come for " working vacation " .
Your oxtail soup was awesome about a year ago .... now , after ordering that once i arrived in vegas , your oxtail meat is not tender !!!
One more thing ... i am a customer of vacations hawaii and because my " working vacation " does not make me have time to go to a buffet .... thus why i stop at your guys place .... i am giving you my visitor $$$.... i could go elsewhere but i like your food !
So what if i came a day later for dinner again ... plse do not poke fun at me ( not ringing up my order promptly !!! ) .... besides , sites like yelp and others do inform patrons about the quality , quantity and the service .
I can not believe i ended up at this hell hole !!!
I can not even begin to tell you how hot it was and the girls were just wilting .... i was so unimpressed , overheating , i can not express how angry i was at this meineke shop , and how full of bull they were !!!
I can not even begin to tell you how hot it was and the girls were just wilting .... i was so unimpressed , overheating , i can not express how angry i was at this meineke shop , and how full of bull they were !!!
Maybe this place has new owners and does not make clients stand outside for 2 hours in 117 degrees !
That said , i do not think this is the hotel for me .
If you want to keep overweight people away , make the seats so you can not get you butt between the narrow arms - mission accomplished metro !!
This has never happened to me in any other place , ever .
It was at this point i realized there was not a desk in the room , only a coffee table .
3 . no desk makes it almost impossible for me to work while in the room .
3 . as a platinum marriott member , i was provided an upgrade to a " king suite " at no additional charge - much appreciated !!
Overall , this may be the perfect hotel for some but for me , i do not think i can come back .
Then he says oh he has you down for a brake flush you do not need that .
So went for it well got the $ 10 but no such discount on groupon the cashier , young guy was rude , arrogant and unhelpful .
Tossed him the $ 39 and will no longer use them .
The car is two months old and there was one tiny spot not worth talking about .
Then after i left i stopped at a store checked the hatch area and they did not even clean / vacuum it .
My family would take all of our cars there to get washed but we will never go back again and i will tell everyone i can to not go there !
If it was a random necklace i would say no big deal it can be replaced .
We decided to go to meineke and not only was there nothing with our brake pad , dean and robert were super professional , they were honest .
The staff starting with the valet and the bellman to the front desk and the housekeeping staff were very friendly and professional but not robotic , engaging in genuine conversation and excellent service .
Did not get a chance to go to the on site theater or the restaurant or either of the two bars but they looked fantastic .
What i can not understand is why did they check us into the room that is 10 feet away from a room where a dead body is located ?
We devoured alllll of it and could not believe our taste buds !
On all fronts , we were very satisfied and can not wait to return .
I will never go back to this place again as long as the front desk guy jim is working there .
We should not feel forced or obligated .
My husband knows how to do basic maintenance on cars but does not have the time , so my husband told him , " no thanks " and that he can do it himself later .
We are coming in for an oil service and not an interrogation .
We did not do the service because they did not have the filter in stock so we rescheduled for another time .
2 weeks later we come in for our scheduled appt for the oil and filter change that we did not have done the first time .
My husband just brushes it off once again , not understanding what this guys problem was .
This guy says they can not use " our " filter unless we bring in or own oil .
Not half and half .
To me this did not make any sense .
My husband ended up telling him no thank you and walked out .
In the end , we called another meineke and they had no problem using our filter that we purchased from the dealership .
Actually they did not have the filter in stock so it was a win win situation for both of us .
Because of him meineke on blue diamond will never have our business again .
Second was less alcohol and not well made .
Not impressed when the drink is weak .
Not impressed with him .
Always the same song , always the same routine , but the sheer amusement never wears off .
For entertainment value , you can not beat centrifuge .
I do not know why they do not mark it as specialty .
Anyway , with my vacations hawaii meal voucher , my meal and drink was free and his was only $ 8 for the oxtail soup ( no drink included for him ) .
Something about the mainland that has their own interpretation of teri-beef , and for a local hawaii resident , this ai n't teri-beef ( local hawaii style ) !
It 's not grilled , and has like a sweet teriyaki sauce just placed on top of the cooked beef ( like it 's yoshida 's teriyaki dressing ) .
The wait staff is usually friendly , the food is not bad , but i do not like : the stupid sexist outfits the female staff wear , and the horrifically loud music , which everybody is shouting over to hear the person next to them=even louder .
The beer did not disappoint .
And if beer is not your thing , they also have local mead and wine as well as a selection of barrel aged cocktails .
No one available to do our pedicures ..
I said " do not call some one in , i will come back .
No one here , door locked .
Not a good way to start off a business ...
Give them a try i am sure you will not be disappointed .
I used to love this place , now i can not get this look of disdain off of my face .
The carne asado was fatty and grisley ( sp ? ) , the chicken was the highlight of the meal , which is not saying much .
I know that they have a bar , but taking my meal as takeout , i did not drink .
The bread of the hoagie was fresh and had many different meats ( even though i do not know exactly what they were ) was perfect on the sandwich .
Overall , the hoagie hit the spot but being the first time going here , i ordered it with everything , not knowing what everything was .
Cons : not the cleanest place in the world and the building shows it s age and personality , so it stays true to its roots .
The line to order was long , but that highlights the demand for the hoagie . conclusion : will revisit in the future but going no mayo the second time around .
It was ok , but i 'd never wait 30 minutes in line for it again .
So it s put in this cardboard box , then the red and white checkorboard paper is put in , then the rice , beans , cabbage , etc. the problem with this is the paper is not designed to be under juicy foods like beans , so by the time i got down to the bottom the paper was disintegrating into my food .
Not very appetizing .
Anyway , would not pay $ 8 for this again , and likely will not visit them again either .
We did not have to wait for more than 5 minutes .
I have never had anything i did not like .
It 's getting 2 stars because the waitress was friendly and the menu does not pull any punches : the pictures look exactly like what you get .
How these chains are all over the country i have no idea .
Service is usually very good and i have never had a problem .
Will not return .
You will wait in line , no matter the time i hear , so prob best to call ahead .
Not too spicy but has a little heat on it !
What did you expect ... with that said i have eaten here twice and brought some family once and everyone loved it , is the beef and broccoli the best in the world , of course not but it s pretty darn good for a buffet .
I can not explain how bad this wash was ... first off had a coupon for 4 dollars off , turn around and they bump up price a dollar for large vehicle .
There was no one in line waiting for vacuum or on back side for drying .
The seats were never vacuumed , the car mats were not put back properly .
The dash , door panels and center console were not touched at all and to top it off the wash was horrible .
I left and will never return .
I also let some buddies of mine know who go through the cheap 5 dollar wash a couple times a week for uber not to return .
So we come here about once a year with our running group for wednesdays ayce wings ( obviously i do not partake lol ) and the venue is great for a large group because it 's huge .
Lobster risotto , yummy but they used a bit of tarragon , not my favorite but good aside form hat personal preference .
We did not eat dessert but we peeked at other tables and we are pleased with the views .
I ordered mine charred medium rare and it was cooked to perfection , the runner , felix could not have been more attentive .
I show up 25 minutes later and i am told my order is not ready and it would be another 10 minutes because it is in the oven .
No problem , i can understand an extra 10 minutes .
I took the refund and the food , but i will never return .
- i do not eat much fish but everyone loves their big fish sandwich . - you will have something to take home , especially if you have an appetizer .
1 is some kind of poker game , 1 always has no audio and if there is a pittsburgh sports game on , it will be on multiple channels , meaning you get maybe 3 different channels to choose from .
It was the first booth i could not fit in ever in my life .
Tell them not to " stagger it " and you will be out of there a lot quicker .
By the way your service does straight up suck you like to collect the cash check and visa but not hold up your end of the work .
All i have to say is that your service there is terrible and i will not be coming there ever again and i will definitely spread the word as well go ahead and keep blaming yelp because your incompetent eventually you will run out of excuses and karma will come back .
Once again your service could caused me serious damage definitely i can say it 's the worse ever not to screw in a bolt after an oil change .
Not only was the price reasonable but with the yelp checkin we got a $ 2 discount .
There was no wait so they had us in and out in no time .
Quick , easy , tastey = never disappoints !
The gravy also did not have much flavour .
I did not finish the box but that may have also been partially due to the under cooked fries and lack of flavour in the gravy .
I may try it out again but i will not go out of my way to get this stuff .
Service was great and quite quick but it was not too busy .
This place was not horrendous but i would not go out of my way to return .
This place can also get super packed with kids since they have a game room in the back , so if you do not want to hear a bunch of screaming and yelling , you should probably get your food to go like me .
I know your feelings may have been hurt because a certain someone did not have her heart set on partaking in a meal at your restaurant .
But i love you , even though the tables are gnarly , the silverware is kinda clean , the floor is not to be made eye contact with and it is advisable to drink your beverage with a straw .
We had a little bit of everything and you can not go wrong with anything .
Get the hash browns all the way - it 's a style , not a request .
It 's not a high class place .
It was so nice to have a party and not worry about the food at all .
The hotel was under construction which did not bother me too much except the fitness room was not available .
It was not blowing into the room .
Plus my husband arranged late check out , so i am not sure why someone would try to get into my room !
I could not even run to the door to keep it closed because i was not dressed !
Why would he even be messing with rooms that were occupied , i had a privacy sign on the door and worse of all , i was screaming from inside to not open door !
Apologies were given but they did not even try to make the situation better or compensate me .
I have never eaten something that so immediately brought tears to my eyes and made me yearn for a quick death more .
Bravo. devils inferno is not something to be trifled with ... trust me it s the next morning and it is now trifling with me in an ungodly way .
I give them a thumps up , good prices as well if you have not tried it ?
And no reminder sticker of the next change .
I do not even know if he put synthetic in .
The experience was exquisite but few remarks on not salting or buttering too much .
Having been a server and bartender in the past , i would never think to leave dirty dishes on a table , especially dishes from another table .
No need to be so unfriendly ( ! ) on the phone when people call to see if you have room !
Can not remember the servers name , but remember the chef was steve young .
Ceo : " i do not want an empty space on the table - keep them coming . " - hot hostesses asking for my directory of sale 's number ( on a napkin ) .
I have never looked so good in my sweater vest on a leather chair .
She told us " sorry ma'am i am usually not like this but they got me worked up tonight " .
2 nd thing is we had an event that night and as i was waiting downstairs there was a commotion going on between the guests and staff about a rule that people under 21 can not be in the lobby by themselves after a certain time , which is a rule i agreed with .
The short african american lady with short hair responded , " i am not going to sit here and argue with people about their fu** ing children ! " talk about unprofessional ?
Got one of pretty much everything on the menu the nigut we went and was not the least bit disappointed with anything .
You can not go wrong !
The food was steamy but we could not wait , we fork it out our mouths quickly .
It was not intact in a square like in other restaurants .
It did not blow me away but it 's homely , tomato - y , and rich as hell .
Delicious and soft no doubt .
I was not really a fan of it because it was strong .
After walking in we were greeted but not in a warm and welcoming sort of way but rather in a stoic way .
The pad thai was fine but i did not really care for my gf 's chicken .
I really wanted to like this place but instead i realized that maybe i do not live as close to it as i thought .
I love bao , have not had it in a long time and i have not been to this location before so i was pretty excited to go .
Price range ( not including tax ) : $ 4 - $ 7 per item .
Food quality ( taste , serving size , menu ) - 3.5 / 5 i will admit i think i overhyped myself for this which is probably why it did not meet my expectations .
I thought the food was good , it just did not blow my mind .
I did not think it had a lot of flavour , a spicer sauce would have helped .
Just as you expect with bao , they are not overly big .
Parking is a bit tough since they do not have their own lot .
Serivce - n/ a you pay at the counter and picked up the food yourself so there really is not much service involved .
I could see it taking less when it 's not busy .
I do want to go there again to try the spicier options to see if it gives more flavour and to try the kimchi fries ; i regret not getting them last time .
Overall , i will try again but next time with no garlic bread and thin crust pizza .
Dumpling is in their name and i did not try one !
Not bad !
I have eaten at another little dumpling location across town and have no idea if they are connected but this location is much better .
On both occasions my burger and sweet potato fries were solid , but other aspects of this place have left me feeling as though npl is not quite the place for me .
Npl was packed during our friday night experience , and i do not doubt that 's the case most friday nights .
The wait was not so bad , though standing around near the bathrooms and claw machine was not an ideal waiting scenario .
( in case you are interested , i think the best fish sandwich is at no - frills harry 's place off route 51 , about 30 minutes away . ) my burger , on the other hand , was solid .
It was cooked close to the medium - rare i had specified , and the seasoning was in - your - face but not totally overwhelming .
Our waitress that day was not particularly pleasant , but because she was chatty i did take the opportunity to ask her about the white russian before ordering one .
In other words , the bartender pushes a button and white russian spurts into the glass , no mixing necessary .
Funny how some bars employ " mixologists " who are so into preparing pricey handcrafted cocktails with a hundred ingredients , and other bars have guns that not only measure the alcohol but that actually go a step further and mix the drink .
I like that i can come here for a decent burger ; however , i can not currently justify giving north park lounge more than 3 stars .
My lunch arrived and it was not quite the arroz con pollo i am used to .
Barros actually has some of my favorite pizza but i will not order from this location again .
The girl on the phone corrected herself right before we hung up and said " it may be a little over an hour , we are really busy " - i said no problem .
An hour and a half later i called to check the status of our order and was told that it had not even been made yet .
That 's 2 hours and 15 minutes for a pizza and wings ... no thank you !
I was very surprised that we were not even offered as much as a coupon for our next visit .
Please do not go and eat here !
I have only been to this place once and i will never be back .
I visited this place with my family saturday night , we had not seen each other all day and we were starving and did not want to wait 20 minutes at another restaurant so we decided to try this place .
First of all they did not charge us at the entrance which i suspected it would be a bit pricey but i did not really care because maybe the food was worth it and we were just very hungry .
She never said anything , my husband sat down and jumped back up because he was on spilled drink .
She pulled out napkins and placed them on the table , i began cleaning and did not make much of a deal about it .
He was eating his beef broccoli and became disgusted by it , i thought it was normal since sometimes he just does not like the taste of things , i did not pay much attention to it and just gave him water to water it down .
When i pulled my drink back i noticed my water was extremely fogged up and then began to notice their was a lot of hard rock soup outside my cup that i could not scrape off .
I could not believe it .
People kept staring at me but began to eat , no waitress came around i had to wave at one .
She took our money and i followed her , i did not wait for her to come back to our table i was just ready to get out of there !
I will never go back to this place and i will never forget this horrible experience .
It 's not fair that people are so inconsiderate and selfish about what they put out there !
Yes it was a bit pricey considering we did not eat much but it 's not about the money .
I am writing this because my 2 yr old was put in danger of getting sick because the people that run this business obviously do not care about what they are putting out there .. they are just their to take your money .
Not horrible at all for the price we paid .
The burrito was way too much food , and i do not know whether it 's just me and southern food , but after eating about half , i did not want to eat it anymore .
I was not really full and it was delicious , but i just did not want to eat that anymore .
Ugh the whole food no taste and simple nasty !!
Will never go back or recommend .
Look , this is not some fancy shmancy place , but hot dang it 's tasty .
Get them with some spice , you will not regret it .
We never have a bad meal .
The service is ok but i did not like the food , i think the mix of meat with the raw veggies is not for me .
Not worth $ 40 for pizza and wings , delivery and tip .
The delivery times are way better than pretty much any other chain and we have pretty much never had an issue with the food .
I call and get some smart - alec teenager on the phone who proceeds to tell me there is no such thing on their menu , he does not know what ricotta cheese is and i must not be on the right website .
Some dipstick picks up the phone and again proceeds to tell me there is no such thing , they have never had anything like this on the menu .
Ta- da there it is , then i find out i am not even talking to a manager because he conveniently is not there and it sounds pretty close to the moron who told me he did not know what ricotta cheese was .
Good thing i am not that big on pizza but the good news is i can get it elsewhere and it is better .
This is not a review on the food here .
When my server approached this gentleman with it , he said to tell me to make sure i delete it immediately cuz he did not want me using it again .
My seat will forever remain empty at this locale , as i will never give them another penny of my hard earned money to be disrespected like i was yesterday afternoon .
The it reason i did not give it 5 stars is that the service was slow .
Never seen so many tvs in my whole my life .
Oil change : did not check coolants or windshield washer reservoir .
Car wash : did not vacuum interior and tried to deliver vehicle partially wiped down on the exterior .
Was fun watching him spit out the cilantro - it was his first time tasting it and did not know what it was .
I take nothing away from the restaurant though as i am not sure cilantro is universally loved by kids .
What i love about yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the " nearby " search and prior reviewers telling you , " it 's okay , try it ! "
I would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat , which i love but is not for everyone .
If you are an interracial couple do not bring this place your business .
If you have kids , they will tell you that if your child is not receiving service that your child is not allowed .
I gave no answer " is he your husband ? "
I gave no answer .
Then i called in a complaint only to be disrespected by one of the managers sending snap shots of my daughter from their cameras to my phone telling me she is not welcomed .
I never gave this woman permission to take and send pictures of my 4 yr. old underage daughter !
To make a long story short this place is over rated , disrespectful , racist and do not like kids .
She sat in your empty pedicure chair where you had no customers ...
I was sitting down so i did not go into your fridge .
He offered to pay for them after your staff jumped down his throat about two 50 cents sodas and your staff did not take him up on his offer .
I am not going to deny my daughter water because you do not want kids in your shop .
My daughter did not run a marathon or 100 yard dash in your shop .
My daughter caused your shop no harm but you and your staff want to lie and try to make this about my four year old when it 's actually about you ( who was not anywhere to be found ) and your unprofessional , rude , catty , racist , and judgmental staff .
Never saw him .
But when they were told " that it did not matter " about our " title " by me ... they should not keep prying into other adults business / relationships .
And should learn to not discriminate because of age and race .
At times we have had great pizza but when they are busy the pizza has less toppings and not so great .
I have learned not to tip since service has changed .
I do not blame the employees .
The windows inside were not clean , headliners were still dirty and they stayed they do not clean those , and there was still soda spots all over the car .
I would not recommend this place at all !
Will not be returning .
My bill was over $ 300 and i do not need that kind of service ever .
Recognizable name yet i had never been .
Wish the heavily cologned couple had not chosen the table right beside me .
I love five spice and with cilantro there are no words .
If you see this food truck around definitely grab a bite to eat as you will not be disappointed !
I can not wait to eat their food again !!
Sandwiches are not highly visible amongst the hand written taps on the chalkboard but ask about them !
We tried the fig and goat cheese as well as a pepper and prosciutto sandwich ( can not remember what they were called ) and they were to die for .
Went back to lazy daisy 's after a long time of not going there as i do not recall it being stellar , food - wise .
The sandwich was not a huge portion , which you think would be more for the price but given that their ingredients are naturally raised meats , etc and there was a lot of it , i was okay with the higher price point .
What i loved though is as a mom , i can eat there and my older child can be entertained and the food there is healthy ( just do not get the decadent pastries for them .. save it for yourself ! ) .
The food is not particularly creative but they do a good job of sourcing quality ingredients and it shows .
The portions are also not the largest , so i would not go in if you are starving .
I am a student and i can not seem to work at home so i enjoy travelling to cafes to work for the day .
They did not mind me sitting all day which is nice some restaurants try to rush you out .
Always in for a london fog and the hard - not - to - get grandma 's butter tarts .
We had arrived to late to find some decent place in scottsdale and even the hotel seemed like it would not do .
I did want to try the waffles to compare it to country waffles , but i did not want to feel really full .
The orange juice was in a machine that keeps running to make sure it 's not sitting still was scary .
This place was not cheap , but it was sooooo worth it !
The service was top notch as well , not too stuffy to engage , and the perfect amount of attentiveness .
You can not go wrong with the pig !
It could have been because i ordered the vegetarian nacho poutine and not the traditional like i should have .
In my defense , i did not know they were going to add the gravy to it .
I have lived in las vegas all my life , and i had never been to this restaurant before yesterday ( 7 -6-18 ) evening .
Our server was bobby , and i could not have asked for better service .
You can not go wrong with this choice .
I have never had a bad thing to eat here .
I did not really like the sales pitch for a new windshield , though he may have been a nice guy i did not appreciate it .
I have never been a big fan of chinese food .. but i have to say this was not bad ... the fried rice was great and my sweet and sour shrimp was good .... the crab rangoon ehhh not so great ....

I can not wait ! ) array of sandwiches , breakfasts , soups , and baked goods , all of which are made with local ingredients ( there 's even a cute little map posted of all the different farms they buy from ) .
And the free , no hassle wifi .
And the fact that it seems like they really want to be a community cafe ( there 's a little kids corner and enough space that i can not imagine feeling like you are ' in the way ' if you linger over a book ) and we have a definite winner .
I may never spend a homework day at home ever again .
Have not been there in a while but had gone the other day .
Staff was kind and helpful and i did not have to wait long at all .
You will be surprised when you walk in because the strip mall is in does not do it justice .
Maybe it 's because of the no cover charge , good music , strong drinks , great company , and chill environment .
You do not have to pay bottle service to get a seat .
The food sucked and my server kelly was not very nice .
This place was not what it was chocked up to be .
The cashier was so stoned she could not understand a word we said to her .
Did not smile , say hello , goodbye , or thanks for coming .
My friend said his tortilla poutine or whatever was good , but he 's from columbia and just did not want to offend me i guess .
It is not the best food .
Not including the overwhelming smell you get when you first walk in .
The toilets and urinals were not sealed to the floor and the two out of the three woman 's rooms were clogged .
Pity there were no belgian beers on tap this time .
This place is definitely not a keeper .
And do not skip on the churros .
But my ' over - easy ' eggs were hard , my little ramekin of beans was refrigerator cold , and the ' baked ' tomato and ' fried ' mushroom slices clearly had not spent long enough in the microwave .
Enjoy the good coffee , but do not eat here .
I can not wait to come again !
You will not be sorry you came here .
It has not changed since then .
This is not a " nice " place to dine in .
The " battleship " is the cornerstone size and it could satisfy 4 - 5 men no problem .
The gumbo was a $ 5 , decently large portion that was yummy , not overly salty , and full of large chunks of chicken and okra and sausage with a saucy white rice base .
I was amazed at the sheer number of chunks of meat or okra - it never ended , all the way to the last scrape of the paper - lined cardboard bowl .
I have not been here in years and as native pittsburgher returning to the area - this is the kind of food i have been missing !
The food is good but not good enough to make up for the lack of customer service .
I was given a $ 10 coupon to make up for the quiche which i spent right away on cookies because i will not be going back .
We got a large cheese ( it 's friday during lent = no meat ) along with bread sticks .
We did ask for extra cheese and sauce since we were not getting other toppings .
I started coming here more and more now that rumrunners is steaming pile of poo and i am never disappointed .
Without him i can not see coming here ...
So while my in - laws were in line to order plain hot dogs because they were not willing to even try the combinations this particular food truck was offering , much less see which other trucks were at the festival , i wandered off and settled on jamburritos .
" ( takes another bite ) at a truck that was not at the entrance so you did not see it . "
The " big bean burrito " is not big .
One night i got china a go go and the next night i got little dumpling and there was no comparison .
They take forever even when there is not many other customers .
The food was good , not excellent .
Not a lot of shrimp in the shrimp & lobster sauce , mostly on top rather than mixed in .
Biggest praise though goes to desiree who always greets everyone with a smile and a kind word , patient even when the customer does not deserve it ( & i have watched a few ridiculous ones ) .
Not to mention makes the best margaritas i have ever had !!!!
I most frequently come here to play pool , which if it has not changed , is half price before 5 pm .
The layout is good though - the lighting is perfect , and the table spacing is adequate enough that you will not be hitting other people .
These were solid in terms of creativity , but overall quality was not the greatest .
So i am not sure it 's worth it , but regardless , i hear it 's packed every week .
Drink wise , they do not serve pitchers .
Beers took a little long to arrive considering all they were doing was pouring ... but it 's not too bad .
However , had i not been with someone who had already had the flavour before , we would never have known as this was not disclosed to us .
It 's no surprise how popular they are for a night out .
We did not try the food so i can not say anything about it , but they have so much variety when it comes to beer and wine .
I have ordered these for parties and events but will always stop ( even if i am not hungry ) when i am in the swissvale area .
There is just something about these subs i can not explain .
Dishes that stand out : walnut shrimp ( i do not see it on the menu for some reason , but i order it often enough to know it exists .
I do not know if it was bad fish , bad cooking or a combination of both but i ended up throwing my food away , the fish seemed undercooked , but greasy at the same time and the toast was extremely greasy .
I even tried to eat it by dousing it in hot sauce and that could not save it either .
My coworker even complained about her food , kind of turned off by this experience so i will not be back .
Why advertise that you stay open until 4 am if you do not ?
The environment is very comfortable and if you had some work to do , you could bring in your laptop for afew hours , given that you do not mind noise .
Maybe it was an off day , but i thought the food today was not very good at all .
Maybe this item is not the best thing to get here ...
I do not know .
The steak was chewy and flavorless despite being labelled as ' cajun . ' the k sadilla had cabbage in it .... but the cabbage was not cut at all ...
I would not get this again , not when there are 3 other very good choices in the same parking lot ( the bbq , the hot dogs , and the grilled cheese ) .
No complaints here !
Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in it s dinning room means bugs in the kitchen .
Will never ever eat the food here !
Can not wait to visit again to explore the menu further !
( but never tried one ) it has wifi but it did not work last time .
Just do not expect it to be quite .
A good place to watch a hockey game with your friends as there are so many big screen tvs all around and you will not miss those special moment !
And if you are really into wings , of course do not miss the ayce wednesday $ 15.99 .
I do not mind going back when i am in the area !
Good pizza & hot wings , have not really had nothing else but that so far .
Been a loonnng customer .. never been disappinted with service or food , great ambience and crowd .
I have been coming here since the day it opened and i can not believe i have not written a review !
Service is always lovely - especially giovanni who never forgets a face or a name .
Keep in mind i always love barro 's pizza but will not be back this time .
Figured i had been forgotten about so i hung up called back and could not get a word out before being placed on hold for another 2 minutes .
I called in not being upset at this point asking if we could be reimbursed and the girl relays my message to the manager and says they will reimburse $ 5 on my next order ...
That 's got to be the worst deal i have ever seen as i had already paid $ 2 for the ranch and tipped the driver $ 8 and they never showed up and ruined our meal .
Just all around worst customer service i have ever had at this location ... on another visit and different day they had all of their beer taps not working and pouring straight foam ...
Do not go expecting quebec style poutine .
Not even sure the cheese was curd .
If it ai not curd , it ai not poutine !
Puzzled , i asked how that could be if the pedicure is free and i was given a different set of numbers and an explanation that did not explain anything .
I am still not really sure what cost what , what i paid for and what exactly was free here because there was definitely a language barrier .
I was having my nails done for an upcoming wedding and figured the extra cost would be worth it and expected the quality would reflect the price and it did not end up being the case .
Both ladies globbed gel polish not just on the nails but the cuticles as well and then would go back and clean up the cuticles with a brush before curing .
I was there for about 2 hours and for most of that time i was the only one in the entire salon so it 's not like they were rushing to get to the next customer - they just did a really sloppy job .
I love poutine : it would be my last meal if i was about to die .... but it would not be a big cheese poutine .
Although the big cheese has a great selection of unique toppings and combinations ( i.e. carolina pulled pork , sausage , sour cream , beef ) , their fries are not anything special and their gravy is extremely bland .
We were in & out in no time , and would likely come back .
Now i am no poutine connoisseur - i understand there 's a specific true quebec way to make this speciality , but i have no real idea how close these are to what some consider a true poutine , but to a layman , it was a fine meal .
The cons were that the place was quite small & cramped , and while the vegan options were there , i believe it cost me an extra $ 1.50 for the vegan cheese - and by no means am i against charging extra for a speciality product with a short shelf life , but it meant that one small vegan poutine came to over $ 7.00 .
We went in without reservations on a saturday night - not because we did not call ahead , but because they told us that they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more .
( we were 2 people ) we stood in line , without really any greeting - no one telling us how long it would be , or acknowledging our presence ( besides the warm greeting from the chef ) .
" 4 , " they say , and then , lo and behold , 2 minutes later , they get sat -- as they passed out one of the customers said , " do not be mad , we had a reservation -- " but i thought they only take resos for 6 or more people ?
And then why did they ask you " how many " and not for your name ?
I did not realize regulars ' money was worth more than mine .
One we were seated , the ignoring continued throughout the night -- glasses cleared but never asked if we wanted anything else to drink ( maybe that 's why new customers do not seem worth it money wise - we do not get a chance to spend any money ! ) , never asking if everything was ok -- we had to flag people down whenever we wanted to order something .

I would suggest reserving a table , not many places to sit , but they do have comfy bar seating .
The music is upbeat , not many people are dancing , but it 's certainly not frowned upon .
Definitely not an experience i want to have again !!!!
I have never been disappointed in a stay at any embassy suites and in fact have stayed at this specific hotel several times .
Tonight however upon returning to my hotel i found my key did not work .
I went to the front desk and was told by the " hotel manager " tiarra ( unsure of spelling because she would not provide it ) that i was locked out of my room because the card on file with priceline was only for " incidentals " and i was not charged for the room .
When i we nt back to the front desk to confront the manager regarding this issue with proof of where i was charged twice i was told " i will not work with you " and " i will not give you your money back " .
When i expressed that i would not leave the front desk until i was refunded ( seeing as how i was clearly charged twice and had proof right in front of her ) she called security on me .
She then told me the hotel would refund my money ( which is all i requested in the first place ) but said she could not give me proof that this was going to happen i just " had to trust " her .
When i asked her what her name was so i could lodge a complaint she told me tiarra but would not spell it or give me a last name or initial .
She also told me i am " priceline 's customer not a customer of this hotel " .
Am i not staying in this hotel that i was just charged twice for ?
I still do not have my money back and wasted over an hour of my evening dealing with an extremely rude , arrogant and condescending manager .
I can not express how disappointed i am in this stay and this interaction .
I have seen several other reviews within the last month complaining about this same manager and can not believe the hilton brand would continue to allow this type of behavior .
This place used to be ok , but now it 's not even worth the effort .
Walked past this place a lot and never really had a hankering for poutine .
Did not have a single problem with the customer service , which is a huge thing for me .
What i did not expect based on the name , was that there would be more meat then cheese curds .
I am not sure if they all melted or what but they were hardly in there .
Another thing i noticed was that the gravy was liquid , which i did not like at all and that without the mustard i would not have enjoyed my food .
I did not mind that some of my fries were really soft , and some were crunchy .
Oh and the " big " cheese did not have that squeak that curd connoisseur 's crave .
Overall i was satisfied , but i went into the place with no expectations , other then a sign that constantly reminded me about where i can get some poutine .
Not anywhere worth spending more than 30 minutes but the music was decent and you can get some really good infused vodka and if you are lucky , a seat .

It looks like the workers really do not care and clean well enough ....
Would not recommend the panko crusted steamed bao though .
The food did not disappoint and the service is very good .
Sure , you can get a traditional banh mi elsewhere for cheaper but those places do not offer the variety of choices that you get to choose from here , the amount of ingredients they stuff into each of the items justify the price .
What is not to like ?
We did not have to wait very long to order at all , bar tenders also would take orders of people in line as they walked by .
While visiting las vegas we decided to try the edge steakhouse , the atmosphere was very nice , the service was great however the food was not .
We have no issue paying top dollar for a good steak dinner .
But it was not what we were expecting .
Granted a lot of people think their food is not that good but ever since i discovered them on a nationwide road trip a couple of years ago , i have been nothing but pleased .
They do not exist where i am from .
He had never been to waffle house before but he enjoyed the price , that 's for sure .
There was not much chicken in our poutine , so i was a little disappointed in that sense .
I am not saying it 's bad , rather , there 's nothing that really makes you say " wow , that 's really good . "
It does not really make you have this urge to come back the next day and have another .
I like that they have an indoor pool so that no matter what the weather is ... you can enjoy .
Since i knew i had no other choice except to spend the night in charlotte , i wanted to make sure i was not stuck in some seedy motel .
As a female traveling alone , i did not want to take any chances so decided on the embassy suites hotel since i 'd stayed at one before and knew that even though it was not overly luxurious , at least i 'd feel safe .
There was a free shuttle bus transfer to and from the airport which was very helpful since i did not need to worry about cab fare .
It was actually sort of too big considering i was all by my lonesome and did not even have any luggage except a small duffel bag .
I do not even like bologna but i actually drool thinking about this sandwich .
Went in and they would not honor it ... said it was wrong and deal was now 6.99 .
I pulled up " their " website and showed it to them ... still , no remedy .
Other than that , no other major complaints .
Food 5 star ... service 3 ... too bad we did not know that locals get 25 % off .
Limited options for those who do not eat meat .
Waiter did not offer pepper for salad but his assistant did when he brought my second salad .
Well , they were not so the manager brought me new ones and waited to watch me try one ... he wanted to see my face ... they were indeed hot ... perfect .
We were told fresh bread was baking ... it never came .
Not sure .
Excellent food , service not so good .
Watched other tables and the waiters were not very attentive .
They did not even wipe down the seats , did not wash the rocker panel on the passenger side ( i should have walked around it ) and did not even vacuum the back .
I was planning to email them to give them opportunity to refund , but can not find a way to contact them online .
Will not come back .
The price 11.99 was not worth it save your money ..
I was not impressed by this chinese buffet .
I will not be going back here at all .
I do not use them for regular washes , but i have had great service on detailing .
If you stop here ask for steve , he has experience and has made one of my red cars shinny again when no other detailer could .
That is a plus if you plan on getting your car detailed and you have no one to pick you up .
A waffle , eggs and hashbrowns to go was not such a good idea .
Never eat waffles to go as they soggy .
I have to admit it was not bad but i 'd rather eat my waffles at the restaurant next time to enjoy them crispier . :)
I love the triangle , get there a little early , i have came later , like 4 pm and there was no bread l eft ... great sandwich .
I can not believe the low reviews on yelp for little dumpling ( i think people just like to complain because they have nothing better to do ) .
Can not wait to try the rest of the menu .
The skinny by no means do i expect waffle house to be a 5 star restaurant but what i do expect is a clean and friendly place and this place never gets it right i have been there 6 times ( no car closest food chain ) as i work around the corner .
The food is ok i do not expect it to be great but it 's not bad .
When i ordered the special the cook seemed to be upset over me disrupting his convo he finished my burger literally in 2 minutes he gave me a small plate with just burger no hash browns and my drink .
He asked how my burger tasted i advised it seemed under cooked and not that great which he laughed and walked away i did not finish burger .
When i went up to pay she charged me for the special i let her know i did order the special and that i did not get my hash browns she deducted . 60 c when i asked if that 's how much hash browns cost she replied rudely and barked yes i paid with no tip and as i was leaving could hear her complain about it i let them know how i felt and how unprofessional they were and left .

The cook was also cursing out loud as he thought i would be cool enough to not say anything .
You would not think much of this place if you were judging a book by it s cover .... or even from the appearance on the inside , but oh my goodness !!!!
They never disappoint , no matter how many times i come back .
No apologies .
No discount offered for future orders or 2 liters of soda like she promised previous upset guests before me .
Based on that i do not have any desire to return to a place of business that does not know how to serve their guests .
Do not even get me started on the lounge fries !
They even have tvs at a lot of the booths so if you can get a seat at the bar to see the game , you do not have to worry .
I really can not speak highly enough about this place .
Been here before was not impressed but this time they had a great selection .
The sushi looked great , but it was a no carb day .
I do not know if this is the norm or holiday weekend made it better .
Whatever they marinate their meat is awesome , and i am generally not a meat fan .
Can not beat the $ 1.99 margaritas either !
If you want a true matte , the gentleman who did my nails apologized as they do not have a " true matte " .
The tacos are not to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than i would have expected .
Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to .
I said my eggs are cold and i still do not have a waffle .
Ps they did not care how crappy the food or service was .
Next if you have a chipped windshield you have a guy that does not understand that you do not want to have it repair " come on the insurance company pays for it " and the icing on the cake .... the car was filthy , even with the supreme wash ..... and yes !!!
Mark , i did comeback and have the car wash and it was horrible , do not give me an excuse get your people to perform like they used to do until you do i will get my business somewhere else .
The pickle was great , not as crunchy as i 'd like , but it s hard to find a large yummy pickle anywhere in the city .
It was a large portion for 2 , and did not finish it .
The staff was great , and it had nice decor . overall i enjoyed it , likely will not go back unless i have a pickle craving .
I do not think so .
2nd visit : ' giant fish ' sandwich had absolutely no flavor !
Wrote to them and they told me nitrogen valve on the keg tap was faulty ... maybe so but do not they taste test their tapped beer every day ???
Never more .
Giving 2 stars for " below average " service on express package ( i never tried their detailing ) .
I still visit this car wash occasionally but i would not recommend it to my friends or family member .
1 . bug prep - bug prep is not always there , even if you paid for it .
It really depends who you get to set you up the machine 2 . car wash machine - it does not always work , i got stuck in there for at least 3 times already .
And even if it works , some wash cycle might be out of order occasionally , so you will notice the soap is not spreading out like it should be .
Those are the things you will not notice if you get a detailing package because someone else will take your car through the machine .
3 . drying - they do not dry cars like they used to .
Now , i understand $ 7 package is not their bread and butter but there are 2 more car wash places in the corner that would offer the same service without drying for $ 5 ( northern / 91st , both shell and mobil offers car wash as well ) .
$ 2 - $ 3 a few times but that does not really change anything .
Again , it was not like this 2 years ago .
I am not asking for a spot - free drying but at least get the major area covered ?
4 . business hour - they do not necessary open till 6 pm during weekdays like they advertised .
Again , this was not an issue until this year .
I spent one hour and half getting my suv washed today will never go back almost had to beg too get a free car wash
Had no clue it was so huge in there - there 's a huge bar , and a huge pool table area and even a video game area too . the menu=wild wings menu the 100 flavours etc .
The waitress said no - in no ways were they affiliated with wild wings . anyhoo - after we ordered the waitress told us our meal would take at least 30 mins because the kitchen was behind .
Probably would not go back because of the wait .
Not sure if it was butter or what from putting it on the griddle but even after sipping it up w a napkin - it was not very appealing .
This is the first time we have stayed in a hotel where the front desk personnel do not look up or greet you as you come in the door .
They also serve some things you do not see everywhere else , like a sandwich with ham , fried egg , tomato and french fries .
Do not be apprehensive when you see a crowded parking lot - they can accommodate a lot of diners .
I am so beyond angry about the service that i received i do not know what to do so yesterday i took my car in to get detailed did not have enough time so they told me to let it sit overnight and be ready at 10 in the morning i stressed that i needed it back by 10 and it was not done so i had to wait around for an hour for staff to figure out what to do once they finally decided that i was going to get my detail part done refunded to me they gave me back my car but they were going to charge me for the regular wash which my car did not even get a basic regular wash there 's bird poop all over my windshield and i have pictures to prove it i am stressed out and i feel so robbed .
They charged me for an extreme wash and did not do that and not to mention my time .
Not to mention the staff did not realize i spoke spanish and were talking crap the whole time .
When i answered them in spanish they looked so terrified because they did not know .
Do not assume and never trust this place
Bre looked like she did not want to be there and not once did she smile .
I guess she is not a people person per say , and to me , customer service and a smile goes a very long way !
I have not had the chance to explore a significant number of the offerings , but i suspect there are a few other gems scattered throughout the less impressive options -- which are still not bad .
I will never be back !
I was forgotten , and they were not busy ... $ 28 for a wiper blade ???
Outrageous ... not dealer cost $ 15 .
Robert 5/1/2015 never heard from anyone ... ,
We stayed in room 434 which was on the corner and set back a little from the main hallway , so we do not have any noise complaints like i have read here .
There 's an omaha steakhouse on site and a few places deliver , but no restaurants within walking distance except a seedy little sports bar .
Also , the wi - fi is not free so be prepared to pay around $ 10 per day .
Not much in the way of food .
Did not like that bartender kept our change without asking and our free brownie for checking in on yelp ( which we took home to eat ) was very dry but frosting was good .
The fries and wings came and the burger never showed up .... the waitress never checked on us or refill the drinks ( iced tea and cocktails ) .
The fries and wings came and the burger never showed up .... the waitress never checked on us or refill the drinks ( iced tea and cocktails ) .
We asked her to explain how we got fries and no burger ?
No response .
After 40 minutes we finally got it needless to say no tip was given for poor service .
I hate not giving a tip but im not going to pay for crappy service ever !
I will never be coming to this place ever and i will make sure none of my friends come here either .
The meat is not that mystery meat you get at other places but lean , flavorful italian meats .
Always quick to refill your drink or give you a recommendation if you can not decide what to order .
Not bad at all ...
No apology for the long wait in 25 degree weather at 10 p
Have not been here in a while .
Has not changed .
There are no indicators or personnel that guide you through what lanes to go to .
I am a regular here ( 4 times a month on average ) and i have noticed the service and quality is not what it used to be .
The order i had last night was not good and their was nothing spicy about it .
When i explained i already paid online , the guy insisted i had not .
Their was a language barrier so i did not want to argue with the guy so i paid for the food again .
I am low key and usually not wearing clothing costing more than $ 50 ( total from head to toe ! ) and have not been hassled here .
I am low key and usually not wearing clothing costing more than $ 50 ( total from head to toe ! ) and have not been hassled here .
I gave him the ticket back and told him i am not going to be using them .
I will not be taking my truck back ever again and will never recommend anyone to you guys anymore .
When even i ask for something they look at me as they did not want to do it .
The cashier never gives me any sign of appreciation at all .
So i am not coming here anymore .
I came on a sunday morning and the lady taking names did not even greet me and was super rude , she also said the wait would be 15 - 20 minutes and we waited for almost an hour .
There was never an apology for the wait or delay in our food .
The whole staff looked very unprofessional and we are running around like they had no idea what to do .
I am only giving this place one star because i do not have the option for zero stars .
I will not be visiting this waffle house again !
This a great place to take people that do not live in pittsburgh so they can have that " pittsburgh hospitality " style meal . :-)
We decided to order for them because she would just not even acknowledge them .
Small place but it 's not too packed .
The burger was good but the fries were not great they tasted like regular fries that were colored orange ... very bland .
Like a kids pizza not cheesy at all .
Like who does not have a brownie with ice cream...cheesecake...etc they had apple tart and some french thing trying to be like an upscale restaurant lol um no .
Basically , you can not go wrong .
They have an 11 pm cutoff but no one stopped them and you could here everything !
There are much better places to stay in charlotte do not waste your time or money !
Not bad i pass by chico 's tacos daily but seldom stop in .
However , i did not care for the chicken taco .
Depending on what you order the food can be from average to not so good .
I am sure it is not like this all the time and maybe it was just last night but i was not feeling this at all .
I think it 's coz i imagined my mom and her sisters there dressed as such and it did not sit well with me .
The music was good and there are some seats for people who decide not to get vip bottle service .
It was not hard to get alcohol since there were not many people there .
I am just glad it was not crowded .
Best part was there was no cover charge .
They really do not skimp out on cheese either .
I paid $ 35 for a gel manicure and received $ 20 off of a $ 25 pedicure , which made my total ( not including a tip ) $ 40 .
I tried to start a stamp card after i paid for my services but i was told that since i utilized the discount of $ 20 off of a pedicure that i could not get a stamp .
So if i am not gon na get a stamp after paying $ 40 then they should either change their wording or change the policy .
I did not have to ask and i did not have to search on my own .
I can not imagine the size of the large sandwich .
Except no one was around for a little while .
Why would any business not be fully manned and ready to offer a service right at opening ?
I then specified premium wash and he began pushing " armor all " dash service ( no armor all for premium package ? " )
( i do not blame him for this .... but you really must figure anyone that unfriendly at first greeting ai not gon na get me to sign up for extras ) .
( i do not blame him for this .... but you really must figure anyone that unfriendly at first greeting ai not gon na get me to sign up for extras ) .
I we nt past a couple times before i stopped in i am from out of town and the neighborhood looked a little sketchy with not a lot of parking .
Still we had not been offered drinks or order taken .
There were 5 or 6 people standing around in the office and not doing anything .
I can not speak to prices as i got my couple of beers for free .
As a local , i do not know if i would seek this place out just to get a drink , because it 's easier to go somewhere off the strip .
Not impressed !
Not classy at all .
But surprisingly there is never any people inside eating ?
Maybe i am not coming during the rush but i am not complaining at all .
I am regulr here almost 1 year but never seen this rude before so embarassed .
No extra ice or no longshot .
I used to recommend people this place but i am not sure from now .
They mail me a coupon with there name and address on it and then do not want to take it .
I say , it does not have an expiration date on it .
Ok she says with total attitude , next time we will not take it .
I say ok , next time do not mail out coupons with no expiration date and next time i will just go to red dragon .
Great beer selection and the bartender was very personable and friendly ( sorry i did not catch her name ) !
My friends and family rave about this place , but i am not a big fan at all .
Never again !!!!
No organization what 's so ever .
I 'd give it 4 stars if the big cheese served big cheese , but they do not .
I can not see how this place has as many stars as it does .
Most likely will not return unless
Had the traditional poutine , fries were well cooked , very crispy , first time i have it , i loved the gravy and cheese ... not sure what to compare it to , but i would go back there again .
They do not use msg and have more than enough choices that should please anyone .
The take out is by the box , not weight , so that is a plus , cram that thing full ...
Anyhow , the hot tea is not complimentary , which is odd , but the drink prices are low and refills are free for soda .
The place is pretty small with no dance floor but good for hanging out .
Can not really complain about free drinks !
I was not disappointed .
My wife had the chorizo breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint .
If you have not checked chico 's out , just do it !
When there do not forget the salsa bar .
I did not like the service i received and the place was so tired and gross .
My room was not ready so i waited in the center space .
I asked the front desk if they would turn down the music ( i was the only person in the whole place ) and she said " i would not even know how to do that so no . " unacceptable .
The bed was comfortable but the rest of the furniture was so tired and gross i did not want to sit on it .
Not up to the hilton standards for sure .
Not one disappointed .
Walking in i was hesitant because i am not a big beer person and a sweet wine kind of person , i know , i know judge me all you want .
Every time i got a bite of cheese and fish together , it just did not taste right .
It 's not a cash only truck .
The last time we came for takeout was on superbowl night because it was packed , could not get a table .
Came here 3 times , they gave us the bill , and we did not even pay and they are like " thanks !
They did not even know we did not pay !
We had call them over and be like ... uh we did not pay yet .
Megan fox hot has some heat but will not kill you .
Not sure why because you could see steam coming from the warmer but it was .
No flavor and incredibly over priced .
Not sure who she is but we asked to speak to the manager .
The server left and came back telling us that the " boss lady " is not here .
Will never even consider going back .
Just hope we do not get sick .
It is clearly several steps up from your local generic mexican drive through , but it 's still just not tasty .
This fact does not dissuade me from visiting chico's on a semi - kinda- regular basis - it is close to my work , and the wait is generally minimal .
If you need to be in - and - out quickly , this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from , and there will be no salsa already included with your to - go order .
Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant - made ( but not quite warm and delicious ) tortilla chips .
Doused in copious amount of salsa , it 's not too bad , but i can not imagine straight - up muching on it without that extra step of preparation .
I can not comment on the beans , because i do not eat them !
Something about the inside of the building makes it very loud inside at lunchtime - not a spot to sit and bring a book and contemplate the mysteries of and the reality of your newly found adulthood ... not that i have , you know , tried that ... or anything ...
As i mentioned in a previous review , i am generally not a big fan of sandwiches but sometimes i get hungry and just want a quick fix without going through the whole kit and caboodle of getting a knife and fork involved .
Never been .
I do not really know what the big deal is about these sandwiches .
I do not remember exactly .
Not too bad .
I do not know how people think this place is good !
For those few people on here who have commented that this place was their first time trying poutine , good lord - make sure you eat at another place and do not make this your last poutine experience .
Do not go on ayce night .
Not worth the wait .
The gravy was good , but i do not quite understand the curds .
It 's good , fast , cheap mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no plans after eating , so that you may lounge around feeling large .
I tip no matter what , what can i say , my heart is pure .
First off , personally think she was just jealous and having a bad day , because we were being so nice to her , we were nearly kissing her ass , despite her negativity ( i do not believe in steeping low , to others level ) not my cup of tea .
She looked at me and rolled her eyes and replied " i am not doing this " .
All because of her , i will never come back to this restaurant again and it 's sad because i adore the food and drinks .
You never know who your serving .
I feel sorry for that restaurant if they do not let that girl go , they already lost somebody who would of constantly been a regular there ( me ) .
And that 's not a good look .
Never going back .
Third , my husband found a hair in his broccoli and the waitress said " do not worry it 's just a eyelash ! " wtf !!!
Good luck whoever wants to be humiliated and not satisfied after they eat !
Not too crowded , and not too expensive .
Food was mediocre - not special about it .
I got the meatloaf which was good but obviously not healthy at all .
This place does not look like much from the outside ( lit up palm tree ) and looks particularly small .. but it was recommended to me by a family member and a group of us went .
We sat up near the bar and there are screens everywhere yet it 's not overpowering ; it will not drown you out trying to talk !
There is a massive screen behind the bar too or projector screen ( can not remember ) ..
Their banh mis are consistently amazing and i can not get enough of their squid tacos having been to this and the queen w locations , i have to say this location is much better in terms of service .
No one said you had to share ! :)
I have never personally been to the brick & mortar location , but my family has always remarked how quick and pleasant the service is .
Best damn hoagie in pittsburgh , order 5 super destroyers every steeler game , get the destroyer and you will not be disappointed !!
No dancefloor , but no biggy .
Unfortunately , they did not seem to hit it right and seem to skimp out on the necessary ingredients , they do not use enough cheese curds , gravy , fries and smoke meat .
The pulled pork sandwich had zero bbq sauce , no taste with some foreign cole slaw .
But i truly can not compliment chef steve young enough !!!
Not sure as to why there are bad reviews , but also have not been here long enough to know what real poutine should be like .
Do not not go there or order online .
We ordered food from there and we asked that it be delivered at 7:30 . it did not show up until 8:30 cold and nasty .
When i called they did not care .
I will not be going back there .
Not gon na say much since it was delivery but for sure fast , easy and yummy ! :)
On wednesdays they have all you can eat wings , starting with 15 wings ( $ 17 after you buy a drink - which is not refillable .. :s )
The service was alright , not the best .
First off triangle uses a pretty much identical sub roll from philadelphia - south jersey it 's cut down the center then split open , stuffed with the goodies and not baked .
The meat was good a bit on the drier side just not greasy but do not get me wrong it tasted great .
Regular american cheese it is no philly wiz here stick with your tried and true keep the american on it a winner every time !
I had tried them a number of times , just on the fly as well as post drinks , and honestly they never came anywhere close to making me happy .
For the first time they managed not to over cook the fries so they did not taste slightly burned , or maybe they just have a new batch of oil on .
They did ok on saturday night , but honestly not sure i will ever go again myself based on previous experiences which were all mediocare at best .
This place is not like the advertised pictures .
I have never stayed in a hotel with no plugs in your room .
I tried multiple times with no response .
The place i was told to go to did not work with my schedule and i can not afford to take time off work to resolve the issue tnt was responsible for .
We did not call the restaurant before hand to let them know that we were coming in , and they were still able to accommodate us , no problem .
I got a coney island root beer , and i have to say , i think i like the coney island brand better than not your fathers .
Do not waste your money this is garbage disguised as chinese food , there is nothing super about their selections !
The servers gamely do their best , but the deck seems stacked against them by poor processes and general confusion , and so it is likely you will not even receive your expensive and mildly gross order in a timely fashion .
They are oddly packed in , without enough clearance between tables , but otherwise things are not too bad !
This is not on that list .
The brown bag beer is a great way to try something you normally would not .
Next downfall , no ice in the whole restaurant therefore , water was not very cold .
Not good on a 108 degree day .
Wine and beer were good and many choices , but again the temperature of the wine was not very cold .
Food i was not too amazed by banh mi boys , as all the rave about this spot made me expect a lot more .
Even this diamond member for no respect .
I did not want to skip kudos to a great place just becuase i was too slow in getting there .
I made plans with kim t to meet for lunch today ... but i could not wait !
So - not jamburritos fault at all , but i was left a bit hungry .
There was just so much good stuff in there , the tortilla never could have held up !
It 's seven hours later , and i am not even interested in dinner .
The customer service was okay , but the food was really not that good .
I have been to my fair share of americanized chinese buffets , but this one was really americanized and when i mean americanized i mean it tasted so bad there was not even a hint of authenticity was in there .
Most likely i will not be back .
My wife and kids did not really care for it either and besides you really can not take the kids word for it .
Ordered a super battleship and was not disappointed !
For the price it can not be beat !
Poutine is not that amazing or incredible .
Therefore , it is not that hard to make .
Compared to southern food , it should not be too hard to master .
The fries are not fresh and i suspect they were frozen .
I will not waste your time the same way this place did .
Not pita pit and this shit .
Not the most flavorful but it was a good price and was filling .
We had a mishap with some undercooked wings and i sent an email just so they would know and hopefully no one else got sick but the manager credit our account $ 25 which i honestly was not even expecting i genuinely just wanted to let them know .
Even with the credit we did not end up eating here again until about 4 months later .
No lengua or barbacoa and that clued me in that it must be a chain and sanitized to some degree .
Anyway , not the great mexican food i have grown accustomed to when traveling in az .
Do not be in a hurry as courses are methodically slow to come out but all is tasty .
The wait for it was not too long , about 10 - 15 minutes and i think it was only around $ 7 or so .
Drop what you are doing and just like .... come here .... no seriously now .
Definitely not the right place if you do not want to be surrounded by kids .
Unfortunately , it does not come with any sides .
Not sure if i will go back to be honest .
Well , that is unless you are willing to dish out more money and order more than one item to make sure you do not walk out hungry .
I will never , ever go back there becos of her and in fact if it was not for me being hungry , i would of said curse words to her and reminded her how customers like me pay for her livelihood .
The burrito itself was good and the cook had a more friendly face than both yolanda and the shy cashier who seemed to have no idea on what to do .
Definitely a place for take - out rather than dine - in , chico 's is not a chain as at least once recent reviewer has stated .
It 's deliciously saucy , not on the menu , and the only thing i am interested in at chico 's .
One last piece of advice : unless your in a pinch , do not bother with the breakfast burritos .
By calgary 's standards , their poutine is edible , and i would have had no problem giving them 5 stars , however ... their pickles , which are quite popular , and worth the $ 1.00 each , as they are / were large authentic deli - style sour pickles , however during my recent visit , i purchased 5 pickles at $ 1.00 each , and as the pickles were being pulled out of the large glass jar behind the counter , i noticed that the pickles looked quite small ( compared to how they normally look ) , less than half of their normal size , however i still purchased them .
When i got home , i tasted one , and discovered that not only were they smaller than normal , they tasted like regular dill pickles , like the ones you would get from a jar at the supermarket ( ie ; not deli - style , and certainly not large ) .
Shame on me for not questioning their size and authenticity at the big cheese in calgary , and shame on the big cheese in calgary , for not only trying to pass off these smaller generic pickles as their usual large authentic deli - style sour pickles , but for also charging the full $ 1.00 .
It 's not the money , it 's the principle :(
As my diet changed , i stopped visiting due to no good vegetarian / vegan options .
And no tip there .
After leaving " china city super buffet " , even though the food and service were good , i will never return .
Well , when you have a little too much alcohol in vegas , you do not think about checking the yelp reviews before picking a place for " a last drink " ... two friends and i stopped by for a bottle of water , a dos equis and a mojito ...
They go all out , the staff are friendly from the front desk to the bar and just anyone you see that works at the hotel they were never rude always polite .
Just one incident our room door was unlocked on the last day do not know what happened but nothing was out of place or taken but we did not have to use are keys to get it .
A must try if you have not been here before .
Little dumpling was not what we are looking for .
The real surprise when i crunched into egg shells when i bit not the egg pho yong .
Plus , there was no gravy .
Little dumpling was not what we were searching for .
Love the vibe , there are no holier - than - thou espresso - wieding baristas like a lot of the more well - known places .
This is not just a coffee shop .
They donate the proceeds from a dish founded in amatrice , and named after it : called " alla matriciana . " because the earthquake made it impossible for the people in amatrice to produce and export their prized dish , the restaurant did not have the pig cheeks needed to make the dish the way it was invented .
The special of the day , a pineapple pork po'boy , was not very good .
$ 8 sandwiches should not have $ 0.08 cents worth of shit cheese on them .
Ok , so i do not love this place as much as i used to but i think that is my fault because i came here too many times .
While your first thought may not be food when you hear embassy suites , it ought to be at least your second , especially if you have kids , and even more so if you have kids who can not agree on what they want to eat .
Then we have one who likes the not - so- big breakfast , which consists of cereals , breads , fruits and the like .
Note that this does not mean he does not eat a lot of it .
Just that it 's not called the big breakfast in our family .
Unfortunately the rest of the meal made me wonder if i just do not get italian .
Honestly , if it werne not for the veal meatball i 'd rate this place a 2 / 5 but it 's kind of unfair i guess because summerlicious is not always representative of a restaurant 's true quality .
I tried the steamed rice ( nice & fluffy , not dry ) , orange chicken ( not bad , very sweet ) , teriyaki chicken skewer ( pretty good ) , won ton soup ( fine ) , french fries ( yummy when fresh ) , green beans ( good seasoning ) , spring roll ( meh ) , lo mein ( okay ) , chinese donuts ( love them ) , apple pie ( delicious ! ) , and fruit ( good ) .
I normally like to get the mongolian bbq as well , but i did not this time .
What can i say about triangle that has not already been said .
I grew up on these subs if you never had these what are you waiting for .
Not bad service or food except when i got home .
I will never eat here again .
Not worth it .
As we had theatre tickets we could not linger .
It is a nice spot in a great location as there are not many other coffee shops around this area .
I ordered a macchiato and was not impressed by the presentation of it .
It did not deliver to expectations .
All in all they seem to be doing well and do not have much competition this far east .
Not really the cafe 's fault though !
After rushing to our room to get some rest before heading to dinner , it became obvious that the bathroom had not been cleaned from the previous guest .
I needed a few extra things such as ranch and hot peppers she was really friendly ( i have been to other places where they get annoyed if you ask for other things ) she had no problem getting them for me .
Jambalya= cajun stew , usually good but not very accessible or common ( at least not in az ) burrito= kinda good , some people love them , i think they are usually too big and unwieldy ... just give me some tacos or an enchilda
Not bad , and you get a lot of bang for your buck .
At the same time , it was not as overwhelming to me as a chipotle burrito .
I happen to be there while she was there and i did not see any of this behavior towards her ?
I think the salon is doing the right thing by taking all its clients in consideration when it asks you to make sure your child respect the other clients and do not run around in the salon disrupting the other clients !
It 's a place of business where people are paying for a professional service not a playground .
I am letting all my friends know about this salon and i can not wait to come back for my next appointment !
Give them a try you will not be disappointed !!!
Have not had it in awhile but their hoagies are sooo good !
The inside of the restaurant / bar is pretty cool too , never had an issue when i went there
You will not be disappointed !
So a german , an indian and a chicagoan walk into an italian restaurant ... no joke , true story .
Not only spice things up but extremely flavorful .
I chose the osso buco ... fall - of - the - bone goodness , no knife needed .
I never order anything else here , but then why would i need to ?
This will no doubt become a regular stop of mine .
No choice for dessert , got the creme brulee and it was just perfect .
Now , i am not an expert but , i have taken a few bbq and cooking classes and my favorite thing to cook is steak .
What i received was not wagyu grade beef .
It was also very chewy and that 's how i know it was not wagyu .
The steak i got from edge was not that .
Everything else is pretty nice but , for the regular prices they are charging , i will not come back .
First time here and not a fan .
Well to be honest i will not be back .
The food is great - not the cheapest - but that 's typical when you get fresh local food .
Not a great feeling when you are barefooted .
They advertise .99 cent taco 's on tuesday but they are actually $ 1.29 ea. not a huge difference and still a good deal ; but it becomes a bigger issue when you find this out after placing an order for the office and , upon arriving to pick it up , the price is on average $ 2 more per person .
Reading previous reviews seems to show i am not the only one who has had issues with the prices listed on their website not being honored when you actually go to pay .
Taco 's were fair for the tuesday price , ( would not ever recommend them at the $ 3 they normally are ) dry and a bit bland , no pico but the salsa is good .
Y' all do not know good eatin ' notil you stopped at jamburritos !
I do not , i do not , order fried catfish in restaurants outside of certain states in the south .
It just does not happen .
I am bringing my mom to the truck , i bet she has not cooked hush puppies since i was a kid .
And do not forget that there 's also beans and all the fixins of a burrito .
If you do not like spicy , do not get the hot sauce on yours .
When would could not finish it even better :)
I do not normally review places but i downloaded the app just to report what a terrible experience my family had here .
I went to the register with a coupon which was from the money mailer and they had taped something to the register stating they will not take them .
I told him about the rotten fruit so that other kids would not eat it and he did not seem to care .
I will never be coming back and i hope this review helps save someone else the same trouble .
We are not picky or ones to complain but this was too much not to say something .
Well they can do celiac safe poutine which is great ; however , the staff did not seem entirely confident in that which made me uneasy .
I would say that if you have had real poutine in qc this is not comparable .
Too much gravy , and not very good gravy .
Not enough fries or cheese .
I guess no one makes poutine like chez ashton , if only there was one in calgary .
I have been looking for a local chinese food restaurant that did not serve " glop " with sodium ( panda express - ish ) .
This is exactly what it looks like - a no frills , good service , freshly prepared delicious food restaurant .
No hot dishes of food sitting over sterno or on a steam table drying out and loaded with salt .
The shrimp lo-mein had plenty of shrimp in it , was not greasy and was very flavorful .
We continued on with a few more starters , beef tartare , a family favorite and the spicy shrimp which has a kick to it but even my girlfriend who can not eat spicy food enjoys it !
Dropped my car off at approximately 11:15 and did not have it returned until 1:50 , even after being told " 10 - 15 more minutes " two separate times .
Never coming here again , i suggest you do not either .
Not worth the $ 200 dollars i paid to them .
Man i hope i got my oil changed did not seem like it .
I can not stress this enough , best italian restaurant !
Do not come here expecting anything more refined than denny's and you will be a happy camper like me .
The prices ai not cheap .
I expected the aura to be more standoff - ish but the waitresses did not mind that we took our time to order .
The free egg roll and the crab rangoon with no crab in it was the best part .
We ordered a lot and it was not expensive , but definitely will not be going back again .
My first experience with a technician at md nail spa was not satisfying at all !!!
I will not let one bad apple spoil the bunch !!
" that 's not saying much at all ! "
I thought the idea of chicken + andouille sausage in a wrap would not work , but i was proven wrong bite after bite .
I have not bought from a food truck in years , and i think i am gon na follow this one around for a while .
They offer a few taste treats you do not see at the other chinese buffets like bacon wrapped shrimp , stuffed chicken , steak kabobs , polish sausage grilled and bok choy all of which were real good .
I have to start out by saying this hotel is very nice , the rooms were nice , location was awesome but .... yes there is a but , the breakfast buffy is terribly handled and you have this huge line only to find out i waited in line for pancakes and did not have too , could have slithered up and asked for them instead of waiting in the omlet lines for 20 mins and the wife ordered an omlet and it was wrong .
I am not sure what odor they were trying to cover up but i do not really want to know at this point .
The staff are not friendly , it 's just a place to grab a poutine and leave because the staff make you feel so uncomfortable .
I do not normally go for wings but my boyfriend loves this stuff !
Lol , i was a tad hesitant to go but once i got there i was pleased with the food , it was good , you get what you pay for , the staff was alright , we had a big party but no one came to check up on us which was odd to me , because we needed a lot of refills and napkins , someone only came when we had to send someone to get a server for our bill .
I do not like the décor , very farm - y .
I liked the atmosphere , made me feel pumped up even though i do not watch any sports haha , i would come back here again but i would not recommend it to anyone .
I would have taken a picture but it smelled so good that i could not wait to dig in .
I also asked for no onions or tomatoes in the gauc , and they came with it anyway , but whatever .
I have been here a lot in the past few months and they have never left me disappointed .
The rooms are cozy and the beds are one of my favorites , i never fail to sleep well here .
I love that they are suite - type rooms so i can close a door if the atrium area is being noisy ( which it generally never is ) . the wifi is fast , the breakfast is fresh and delicious .
Overall , not a bad place to stay for the night !
Smaller in size to most wings places and the flavors does not stand out too much to me as most were bland and uninteresting .
I can not eat food that spicy but even i was ashamed that they called some of them spicy as i did not even get a kick from it .
Like there was no spice at all .
Service was on point this evening despite it being all you can eat wing night - we never were left to wait long for a drink , attention of food .
You walk in and are no longer surrounded by flashy lights and slot dings .
And then i wanted to get water for a friend and they do not serve tap water , only fiji .
It was not too crowded and we got a seat at the high top with a set of cards against humanity on the table .
I for one am glad i did not listen to the reviews comparing it to places hundreds of kilometers away .
I will be returning , no question .
There is no doubt that edge steakhouse serves excellent food .
Management did not seem to mind either - encouraging some of the most shit faced clientele to have more wine , etc. sat next to a guy that looked exactly like eric stoltz and asked about the happenings in the city .
He could not give me a clear answer and was a bit of an asshole .
Very lack luster reception at check in , even as a diamond member they could not seem to care less .
I forwarded pictures of roaches in the bathroom and faulty fire alarms to the management but it did not seem to bother them too much .
Will not ever stay here again .
Mosh pit crew routinely use dirty rags , forget to vacuum trunks , miss door jambs , do not apply dressing to tires , dash , etc when paid , do not shake out mats , leave dirt and oil on lower parts of rocker panels that the brushes miss , and generally have to be asked to provide the services for which one paid .
At least once a vehicle was not buffed as agreed upon and paid for , and another time a vehicle was not hand waxed .
The rice had great flavoring and the chicken was tender - but most of all the side of hot sauce was damn tasty , can not say i have had anything like it !
It 's nowhere near the best poutine you have had ( unless you have never left calgary ) and way better than the worst .
Overall i was very impressed can not wait to come back .
Not a chance !
To my surprise , we did not have to wait to be seated .
I was not impressed , however , it tasted ok especially when dipped in honey mustard .
The sandwich was really good and i thoroughly enjoyed the fries although they did not come with any sort of dipping sauce ( and i was not going to dip them in ketchup ) which was a slight disappointment .
Never ate here before and i am always up for trying new places we were greeted immediately and promptly seated .
They accidentally made my chicken wrap plain grilled without buffalo sauce ... but i am not one to fuss even though the waitress offered to fix it for me .
We were there for about 2 hours and most of that time was hanging out and waiting on the kids as it was not a busy time .
The food was cold old and gross , i am definitely not going back
Never had bad service or a bad slice .
Small , probably a good place to get a drink before dinner , but definitely not for a big group .
Friendly staff , clean environment and reasonably priced beverages ( ex . $ 1.25 for water & canned soda , $ 1.75 for san pellegrino ) food is as good as other locations , i just wish it was open a bit later ( to 10 pm during the week . ) well executed panko tofu bao : not greasy , toppings and condiments did not overpower and bao was soft and fresh .
Complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund .
Worst mexican food i ever had this place is going on my never again list .
This place is small , but it does not appear to ever be crowded , and the small crowd that was there seemed to turn over frequently .
Why have i not tried this sooner ?
When i went it was not too crowded ( 11:30 ish ) but i believe lines form around 12:30 until 2 .
This is incredibly filling ... i was not able to finish the entire box .
The wait staff was ok , but i was not overly impressed .
It is tough to judge on only one visit , but i do not like to have an empty drink cup for as long as we had .
Overall , we did not leave hungry and i would order everything we did again .
I do not live in the area , i am house sitting near by , but would definitely recommend this place !
We sat at the bar and the bartender was just leaning over the edge of the bar not even paying attention to us .
He did let us sample a few beers after i asked , but he did not seem to like his job as he was not very engaging .
We ordered our drinks and did not hear from him after that .
Let me just add that the place was not packed and the staff looked bored .
Do not miss out !
Do not settle .
I do not even really care for cauliflower and i loved this soup !
This was the worst experience i have had with barros and sadly i will not return .
It looks delicious can not wait to try it triangle bar and grill is mostly a take out order place for sandwiches and hoagies
Chicken , beef , and pork dishes are not hot .
I am not very picky when it comes to the restaurants i eat at ; there is something i can generally find good to eat .
I regretted not being adventurous enough to try their more adventurous creations like mucho italiano or the notorious p.i.g. ( r.i.p. piggie smalls ) the scenery of the joint was slightly overwhelming , for a small space there certainly was a lot of swag on the walls .
In truth i am actually rating this place as three and a half stars , but something tells me i will be asked to come back to this place again , and something tells me i would not put up a fight either .
I had called earlier to see what the cover was , and they said $ 40 ; when we got there however , we learned that was not the entire picture .
Even though they do not run that special anymore , dan is always kind enough to offer me a discount on prices that are already lowered compared to other places .
If you are looking for a quality business , that uses the newest products , keeps up with the trends in nails , and just an all around great place do not go anywhere but md nail .
Do not stay at this hotel it is dangerous and the night security is inadequate .
If you are a woman traveling alone and / or with your family , do not stay here !
After waiting for security to handle the issue , it never stopped .
I asked for a new room and was told that there was not anyone to bring me a key .
The night manager started shouting at me and even told me that my room was not his issue .
It was obvious that they were not going to secure the situation next door and i was not going to get a key , so i walked downstairs and asked for a refund .
The icing on the cake ... not 1 time did someone say , " i am sorry that this happened to you . "
What 's not to like ?
If you do not know what i mean , check out the big cheese poutinerie and find out for yourself ... if you dare .
I am not giving a 1 star because i do not want to be an a#@$ .
No brunches on weekdays !
Sorry but if the server was not so nice i would told them off .
We did not know many of the beers that they have listed , they have 30 something on tap , just as many in bottles / cans and another 30 + wines .
The north park lounge will not blow your mind , but it 's consistent and decent food .
I have never had great service here , but it 's typically at least acceptable .
It 's not overwhelmingly spicy , but it still packs a punch .
Otherwise , i would not get anything exotic here , but the standard menu fare is just fine .
My only complaint is you can not really eat " healthy " here if you so chose .
I have never had an issue with the hotel staff , they have always been friendly and helpful .
The hotel is currently under renovations ( june 2016 ) which it desperately needs , however i just stayed in a " renovated room " and it seems that the room was put together by construction workers that had no attention to detail .
Also they have not replaced all the furniture yet so the main room is mismatched .
The bathroom tile was very dirty looking with bits of hair / fuzzy in the corners and just looked like overall it needed a good scrubbing despite being recently " renovated " overall a decent place to stay and i can not wait to see the renovations completed .
I called ahead to make sure there was not still a lot of construction going on because i did not want to be disappointed .
The front desk staff assured me there was not .
I was not able to make it to the complimentary happy hour either day i was there , but i do like the new bar set up .
There are not many hot items to choose from , and like many other buffets , have several varieties of chicken / shrimp that all taste the same .
They are really just there to police staff and charge extra if you grab a dinner item , not all of which were explicitly marked .
I probably will not come back .
Nothing fancy , but generally filling and not bad .
This place started out well when it opened .. but they start doing what all other new buffett places do , by starting to " cut back " by not preparing fresh food as often , and restocking less often , especially for their " costlier " items .
I have never had such a terrible car wash ... all they did was vacuum the inside .
No one wiped down anything inside and they let the sun dry the outside .
If you truly did this you would see my wife and i pulling up with 3 employees standing doing nothing and no one approached or directed me .
I asked for one $ 10 and two $ 5's ... she gave me one $ 10 one $ 5 and five $ 1's was not what i asked for and she did not bother explaining or counting my money back to me .
My wife and i got in and the inside was not even remotely close to being wiped down .
No taste and the pieces were way too big and full of stringy gristle .
When i picked up my car , the specific places we spoke about when i purchased the package were not even slightly improved .
When i spoke to the same sales man he backtracked and stated that he did not guarantee the success of their work .
However , very disappointed there is no smoking section .
Not fair .
The cook did not even take time to slice the flavorless heap of meat that sat sadly on my iceberg .
This place is frequented by lots of locals i can not figure out why ......
Is there a gold membership we do not know about ????
I personally have not eaten at chico 's tacos , but my co-worker , who sits right next me , just did .
My other co-worker did not fare nearly as well .
Yeah , with what i have experienced , and just second hand , i do not think i will be taking my business there anytime soon .
I was with 3 other people and no one else had a complaint .
I would not cut this place off my list yet
Then after we are seated and waiting she tells ya she can not help us !
No thank you ma'am .
I will never be back .
Thanks but no thanks .
It ' s a pretty upscale place that does not get too crowded .
The location is ok but does not have anything in walking distance , except for a run down shopping center across the street .
I orders some of the spicy hot and sour soup today for the wife since she is not feeling well with the sore throat and all .
The hot and sour soup did offer some comfort and the spiciness added some kick to clear things up when you are not feeling well .
No real , " i like this " punch in any of the food and on the greasy side just a little bit .
Not great , not awesome , just good enough and it 's new owners from the people i last dealt with 3 years ago .
My girlfriends and i were in dire need of some appetizers , and we happened to stumble past caramel bar & lounge ( and by stumble i do not mean in a drunken stupor , we were not at that phase yet ) .
We were then told that they are not serving food as it was 9:17 , just minutes after they stop cooking .
I finished the water pretty quickly ... in a gulp practically , since there was not much to begin with .
At this point we are thinking : a ) if fiji is not worth $ 10 , neither is your faucet water b ) if you had bellagio water , why did not you bring that the first time ?!
Explaining that we were not going to accept a substitute for water that they had thrown away at our expense , she gets her manager who comes by , drops off a new bottle of fiji water without saying a word and just leaves .
No apology , nothing !
Almost hate to say it , but a tip was not left at this place .
I know it 's vegas , but that should not sacrifice good service and informing your customers of their options .
Then again , i can not imagine that the person who runs this place knows how to read .
Do not worry , this place is paying them plenty of royalties .
Playing pool here is mostly an exercise in trying not to step on other players and swearing at the oddly built tables .
The waitresses try their best , but this place is so poorly run that i can not imagine working here is a lot of fun .
Good luck finding a server if you are in the pool area ; they have some strange " you can not order drinks at the bar " policy which leaves you hunting down the last person who acknowledged your existence .
I know what neon tastes like now , and it is not good my friends .
What i enjoyed most was this place had the beef that was great tasting .. not touch and chewy like other chinese places .
I especially liked the very fast service ... no idle chit chat like " how 's your day akhil " " omg i love your sweater ! "
Like c amon becky , i do not have time for that .
And i do not even own any sweaters .
It was nice in there , there were chairs to sit on , it was not over crowded or too loud .
Did not know it came w/ it like a typical fortune cookie would be . well anyways , i enjoyed the wontons .
However , quantity does not justify for the quality .
It does not taste like the other pad sew ewe that i have at other thai restaurant .
Oh but wait , this is more of a chinese take out , not thai ... hmm ... i probably will not be coming back .
The driver did not speak english and had no clue what i was saying to him on the phone .
It 's been 90 mins and the food has still not arrived .
Never again .
I never heard about this place , but brendan and i were hungry and in the area , so i checked yelp , saw this place and off we we nt .
I can not wait to come back here for some battleships the next time we have a get together at the house - you can not beat the price for the quality you get here .
We will not be back any time soon .
Location : not very familiar with charlotte
I had no idea what the location of this property was like .
Had i know i probably would not have given it a chance .
The neighborhood is not much better , it 's pretty much " the hood " .
The selection of color is great and the location is not too crowded would definitely come back ! =]
How insane i have never reviewed this place .
When i was asked to partake of course i did not refuse .
I devoured my portion of that sandwich as though i 'd never eaten before .
Will not return !
I am giving this place 3 stars only because i can not do 2.5 .
For $ 175 i expected to not get into a car that was mostly done and it took 2 hours .
The steering wheel was never wiped off with the armor all or whatever they are using and it was obvious it needs to be cleaned .
I did not realize they were still wet .
The back hatch of my suv was never wiped off - lots of dirty spots .
I will not be going back there any time soon .
They did an ok job but it probably was only worth about $ 100 not $ 175 .
There was also not a scent in the car except chemicals from whatever they use to clean off the inside and the leather cleaner .
Trish gives a good leg massage , she cut my big toe nail on an angle & it looks odd , i do not think that was intentional .
There were 3 customers talking loudly on their cell phones during most of my pedicure , not very relaxing .
There should be a no phone zone when other customers are trying to relax .
That really made me uncomfortable , no one should touch anyone 's purse .
I can not say enough about the fine staff , decor and rooms .
Only downside for me was no tub , but only a large shower .
Three quick elevators so no waiting .
My idea is to do one without soup because laowai ( gringos ) do not really know what to do with takeout soup .
We did not go for food this time , but from the times i have been here before i recommend going with any of their wing sauce .
I have not found a bad one yet .
As i have come to expect from the hilton family of hotels , this embassy suites was no exception .
I was pleased with our stay and would recommend the location to anyone visiting the area ( if you do not mind a lightrail or car ride into the city as it 's a ways out from downtown ) .
There was no bacon in either meal ; there was no sausage ; there was no meat in either meal !!
We are not not happy ! we called the waffle house immediately & they offered no explanation or remedy ; told us to go online & complain .
We are not not happy ! we called the waffle house immediately & they offered no explanation or remedy ; told us to go online & complain .
I had not had catfish ( scratch that , good catfish ) in quite sometime .
There is no wrong way to have chef michael brown 's catfish .
If they do not have the catfish , i usually go for a chicken jamburrito with rice , andouille sausage , pepper jack cheese , and lettuce .
Lastly , can not forget to mention the hushpuppies .
I consider myself a foodie , but i eat these little deep - fried puffs so fast that i do not take anytime to figure out what is in them .
I know for sure though , they are not like any hushpuppies you have had before ( oh so good ) .
The hot sauce is not hot so i am guessing mild is really mild .
Tables are not even an arms length away .
Was going to order more but could not justify paying $ 17 for 10 shrimps .
However , the service was so incredibly poor -- but when gratuity is automatically built in i suppose there 's no urgency with a larger party .
It was not a game night or event night so assumed it would be fairly quiet .
Asked if we could sit in one of them empty ones and we were told no , we can not seat you for at least 45 minutes .
Does not make sense .
Will not be going back here again .
I was not expecting much from a bar / restaurant , but was hoping for a better meal .
Probably will not return because of the disappointing experience .
Without knowing about the place or checking the hours they are open , you may not even realize it s there .
No frills , no fancy décor .
This place does not have anything except sandwiches and a few sides - no wings , no chicken tenders , no fries , no salads , and no appetizers .
I was fully prepared for a sunday cheat meal ( as i do not often eat sandwiches anyway ) .
Bobby went to order a captain and coke and we were told " we are more of a shot and beer bar .. we do not have any ice right now " lol which was funny and perfectly fine - we both settled for beers .
There is an atm , but it was not working while we were there so bobby had to run down the street and withdraw money while i waited for the food .
He was shocked that we had both finished our 13 " halves ( please ...... we did not come here to mess around ) .
It was honestly more than enough to take home for another meal , but i could not stop !!!!!!!
Remote did not have batteries in it so i called the front desk and they were very short with me and said maintenance would be up shortly to give me batteries .
Needless to say i was not very impressed with him .
Mistakes happen , but they were not even apologetic .
We will not come back .
Overall , not very impressed .
Not sure if that 's a good thing .
Service is always friendly too and when you order in person you never have to wait too long .
I also like their buddah 's delight as well if you are not a meat - eater .
Food was very good , decent prices but i felt like i was bothering the waitress with wanting food containers , refills and she was not very friendly .
I did not this time .
Usually barros is very consistent with their taste and quality , this last time we went it was not as good .
The pizza was not cut very well and the lack of the toppings were all put towards the middle
This is not a typical pasta / pizzeria joint ( not to knock pasta / pizzeria joints ) .
If you are on the pool table side and you do not play in any of their pool leagues , you are lucky if you can even find a server .
I will never come back here .
Visited on good friday for lunch and it was not packed to the tits like other days ( like their ayce wings on wednesdays .
We were there not for a pig out this time .
I was never a wing person but these are excellently done .
Not tooooo saucy like many places .
I can not wait to visit those little plastic chicks and hens again
It 's been hard to find a home for my spa and nail needs but have not stopped coming to either locations since my first visit .
Services & hospitality are never less than outstanding .
To my knowledge , he had not approached my car , which was now in the car wash .
He told me not to worry , if i had " glass coverage " on my car , because they could fix the chip and call in the problem to the " glass center , " who would take over from there .
What this poor woman i am certain did not understand is that the " glass center , " in addition to getting all of her personal information , was going to make a claim on her comprehensive coverage .
Anyone who drives a car knows that a chip does not always turn into a crack .
Do not fall for this !
Btw , my windshield did not have a chip , as examined later by me and my husband .
I wanted to intervene when i was observing what was happening to the elderly woman , but i did not want anything " mysterious " to happen to my car before i got out of that place .
Just do not expect to sit and eat .
So that means : no prime rib-eye .... no new york ... no sirloin ... no prime rib ... no portherhouse !
So that means : no prime rib-eye .... no new york ... no sirloin ... no prime rib ... no portherhouse !
( see menu pics ) did i mention that this restaurant is in the westgate , which is not much more than a time - share masquerading as a casino ?
One should never use the words " westgate " and " wagyu " in the same sentence ; that 's what i call culinary cognitive dissonance .
Overall my review has not changed in terms of the coffee and overall feel .
The most incredible craft beer , 37 continuously rotating , not to mention the wine too .
Do not let the beards throw you off ladies , the mgr is certainly knowledgeable of his wine & bartenders that remember your name .
The restaurant itself is tiny , so do not bring a huge group .
As a herbivore , my choices were not entirely limited and the staff was willing to make accomodations .
The only problem i had was that not all of the dishes came out piping hot .
I do not have a job that is rough on my hands and nails , so i really feel like the fact that my polish chipped says a lot about the service .
2 days ago i noticed a small chip in the polish on my right thumb , but it was so small it did not bother me that much .
This morning the gel polish on my left thumb cracked and not 10 minutes later the piece fell off .
I do not know where to begin .
I am kicking myself for not reading the reviews before checking in .
I have never had a bad experience with embassy suites and trusted the name ... never again .
As soon as we drove up i felt uneasy ... the local area was not very inviting .
The hotel was dirty / dusty and not well maintained .
The furniture , elevators , hallways , etc was just ugh ... the blanket in our room had not been washed and had a really bad odor .
We asked for a new blanket and the girl that delivered it to us had a nasty attitude and asked " what 's wrong with the one you got " . my husband told her to smell it ... she responded " no i will not be doing that " then handed him the new blanket and walked away .
The breakfast was not good .... at all .
They did not keep the dining area clean .
Never ever ever again will i stay here when i come to charlotte .
And never again will i stay in another hotel blindly due to the name alone .
Do not let the unconventional locale fool you ... definitely a must - stop whenever in the 7th st & mcdowell vicinity .
Go for any of the asada and pollo plates and nachos ... you will not be disappointed !
Decent hotel , but restaurant and room service are not customer friendly .
They have over 125 craft beers , can not go wrong there !
Ok , the last time i went in there were a couple of big differences : - the store hours have shifted much earlier than before , some nights closing as early as 5 pm ( although this is to accommodate opening early for breakfast now ) - all the regular staff behind the counter are gone ... the replacements are friendly and efficient enough , but so far it 's just not the same .
As long as the food stays tasty i will continue to come back , but i just hope that they do not move the closing time any earlier during the week !
I did not say anything , but actions spoke louder than words and i left no tip .
I decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so i we nt home with an open mind , hoping to find a treasure .
I do not mind cabbage but that is not what i ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies .
I will never be going back .
They did not control the situation awful experience .
Never have we had this problem .
When we got our pizza tonight it was not cut .
Service was very poor , the workers had an " i do not care " attitude , giving off a bad vibe .
It 's worth a shot if you like poutine , but i will not be returning .
The portions are smaller , service is slower and it is not the same by any means .
I used to love the shrimp pad thai , but it 's not even close to what it was .
There are only a few booths for patrons to sit down and dine in , but now there is a hand written sign on the walls , " clean up your plates before you leave " should not you be happy people are dining in your place of business ?
It only takes a few seconds to bus a persons plates , but there are not even plates used , they are those cheap cheap cheap dollar store styrofoam plates , low budget , low quality .... it used to be good here , not anymore .

Entered there for early lunch and not very hungry which is not a good sign for lunch place reviews .
Not impressed .
Took 20 + minutes to get food , and then the orders were not completed ( hash browns were not done right , waffle came out way later than the rest of the food ) .
Not impressed .
Service was fast but not that friendly .
We came here because the club " the bank " was not opened yet .
Do not ever waste your time here !!
Walked in sat & waited 10 mins no one greeted no coffee nothing .
It was sunday morning 8:30 and not busy .
The place was dirty floor was sticky and tables not clean .
We left as we arrived receiving nothing not even a greeting or water .
As we departed the were laughing and happy to not work .
And the prices are very reasonable , which is something you can not find too often in toronto .
My husband ordered poutine , which would not be my number one choice but it extremely tasty .
This is not my first time here as i have been here multiple times with family and friends .
Most of the waiters are pretty much never present when needed and when they appear , they are pretty hesitant .
I have not actually had a ' great ' service from the 5 - 6 times which i have came before .
Every time i come here , i will always order the honey garlic chicken wings and will never get bored of it , even if i got another order !
The size of the wings are not small wings , so for what you are paying is pretty worth it in my opinion !
I have heard good things about the meatball hoagie , also , just have not tried it personally .
And do not take your frustration of having to carry cash out on the guys and gals making your delicious hoagies ; it 's not their fault you do not plan ahead .
Parking is not hard , unless you come early on a sunday .
The food was the best chinese takeout i have had since i have moved to nv , however not even close to what i have had in ny .
The only thing that really bothers me about this place is that it does not serve dumplings !!!!!!!
It has pot stickers but no dumplings ... and no , they are not the same thing .
Do not come here when it 's not busy !
They did not even have someone behind the counter doing the mongolian bbq ... :(
I probably would not come back since this could be more of a place to grab a few drinks .
I do not really want to pay club drink prices at a lounge .
Since this was one of the further cafes i had to trek to , i was glad my efforts were not wasted when i planned to study there .
Originally , i was planning on trying their pear creme tea because it was something i have never heard of before .
The dirty chai latte i ordered with a double shot espresso was not as sweet as other chai lattes i was used to but , it was not bitter where i had to get out of my way to add any sugar .
Not very busy so not sure what the problem is , expecaly on weekend prices .
Obviously this is not the most authentic mexican place you could go to eat at , but it definitely is good .
This is the kind of place i would love to have gone after a night of debauchery , but unfortunately i do not think this place is open late .
The peas were not over cooked and mushy , and the chicken was real - and the cheese curds were appropriately melty .
It was not gourmet , but there is a special spot in my heart for a cheap pile of poutine .
At this north hills location there is often a fairly long wait on weekends , but of course you can grab a drink from the bar while you wait - which makes the wait not so bad .
I have never had unfriendly or bad service here and the food is always solid , although it is also fairly average .
However , i have never had anything come out cold or not the way i wanted it .
Their french onion soup is amazing and the lounge fried and burgers are really good - juicy , hot and never dry .
Other menu items like their salads and other non-burger sandwiches are just ok and slightly underwhelming ... ive had the grilled chicken salad with the fries and the buffalo chicken salad - they are just average for me - it s usually just a lot of lettuce with few toppings ( chicken included ) - i like a lot of " stuff " in my salads and if i am eating a large dinner salad out , i want it to have a good lettuce to " stuff " ratio , which these often do not .
I am not from the north hills , nor am i from pittsburgh originally .
I ordered around 4:40 pm and i did not get my order until 6 pm .
When i got my order , the whole bag was soaked with liquid because the containers were were faced vertical , not flat down like you 'd normal place containers .
Not sure if the driver was speeding and turned corners fast but everything was soaked .
We found a bottle cap in our drink , waitress apologized and said manager would come ... guess what after 30 minutes no one .
It s obvious they do not care about their clients or cleanliness .
Would never come back .
The only thing i did not like was the establishment was not as clean as it should be , the floor did not look like it had not been swept in a lil while , and the bathroom was disgusting !
Went here on new years day and the food was pretty good but i have also been here on a weekday when it s not so crowded and was not pleased with the food .
Poutine is really a montreal thing / do not think they have it down in calgary like they do in montreal .
A couple things i did not like , but it 's a buffet ... you just leave it on the plate .
If you are in the mood for a chinese buffet , you can not go wrong at this place .
I will never go back .
Never again !
It was $ 11 total ( $ 9 for the catfish bowl and $ 2 for the hushpuppies ) and i definitely will not finish it .
Anyone who gives these guys a bad review is a crabby snob ... do not listen to them .
I dug into the fries after my first bite of the bao , and it was all soft ... no crispiness .
Now , my mentality is : you can not mess up a good fry .
When i arrived the guy had no record of my appt .
He also had no idea what the groupon was .
They had not wiped the vinyl .
Did not vacuum the carpeting .
It was not .
They did not speak english so i went in to talk to the cashier .
Have not heard anything .
Never should have taken my car there .
Salsa had no flavor at all !!
So please do not listen to want anybody else has to say about this place .
It 's not very spacious , but it 's a great place to go with your friends ... especially if you want to have some fun , but not go to a club .
We called to the front desk to have us moved , when we got to our new room it was not as bad as the first but i could tell it was not good .
When we got back that afternoon it did not seem like anything was done .
I asked the man if he opened the vents up and cleaned them and he said no so i asked him to take the vents off so i could show him what was in there .
I asked how often they clean the vents and he said " they are supposed to clean them once a year " but it is obvious they do not .
Do not stay here unless you want to breath in mold !
Will not be ordering again .
Do not let the fancy - shmancy atrium distract you !
Seeing that many kids in there , i opted not even to dip my toe in -- you know how kids are in swimming pools !
Food is made when ordered and they use real eggs not the powder stuff .
I wonder if having a lazy eye is a job requirement at waffle house ) ..... no need for a menu ... i know .... i always know ..... i want the cheese egg special that comes with raison toast , apple butter and yummy ass hashbrowns ( be careful in some states it comes with nasty ass grits ) ....... sometimes i get a double order of eggs ...... and a diet coke ofcourse .....
Then i watch as the even uglier sweaty cooks go to work on my breakfast ... my mouth waters ... not even the stench of the fat truck driver staring a my tits next to me .... can stop my excitement ... my tongue waits to lick the plate ... greesy cheesy goodness .... no need to have any class here .... as i look around at another truck driver picking his nose in the corner .....

Flavours range from " no heat " to " inferno " so there is something for everyone .
You do not get ayce beverages .
If it s your first time , ayce might not be the best choice given the single flavour option .
They were both in the mild category but i would have moved them to the " no heat " category .
I m not a wimp when it comes to wings but find no two restaurants rate their sauce the same so we played it safe ( this time ) .
The first round were breaded , the second round was not .
I personally prefer no breading but the sauce does not cling to the meat as well without it .
Not sure but i enjoyed them all the same .
I do not think i need to reiterate what others have said about the amazing food , organic ingredients , and many many children .
1 : i do not understand why they continue to take a name for the order but then never call the name .
I would not mention it if it was not consistent .
It 's like their dishwasher does not do a good job .
And on one occasion , the staff member that brought our food out actually gave us two dirty napkins ( you know , like you wiped your fingers on them but never unfolded or crumpled them up ? )
I am not a crazy germophobe , it 's not something i would normally notice , but it 's happened enough times that i thought it was worth mentioning .
I would have thought this meant the seats , but apparently it did not , it meant the dashboard and the display console area ( steering wheel also ) pretty much the dashboard the of car .
So none of my seats were clean and the door also had some oily fingerprints on it , they did not clean the door .
A couple other things is nobody seemed like they were on the same page , i asked the lady in side what the leather treatment meant and she said " i do not know , ask the guy out there " then i asked if there was a menu for a description and she said no .
If your customers are not happy , make up for it !
If you were to bring people back that did not feel satisfied and you made up for it , they would rate you higher and you would also have a higher retention rate .
Very expensive . the chicken wings were not cooked properly and it just not worth the hype .
In response to marc r.s response : first off i do not know what my truck being a 90's has to do with anything , because as i watched your in experienced careless employees spray directly onto my distributer and everywhere else that any other experienced detailer would have known not spray .
Does not matter if my vehicle is a 1990 or 2017 .
Also , that is a complete lie that i was advised about the waiver , this is exactly what i was told that i was initialing , that my vehicle had no check engine light on , and it did not !
Another complete lie , brian was not the one told me of the condition of my vehicle , the only reason i knew was because i watched them mess up our vehicle so i personally went out and checked .
It is funny you say any pre-existing conditions on our vehicle would have caused this , yet i had no problems driving it 30 miles one way to your location and 2 days prior passed emissions with flying colors .
The only reason our car is not running is the lack of training and experience by your employees .
Had they had the proper training or cared about the customers car this would have not happened .
Thank you for ruining our vehicle and if your yelp reviews are a representation of how you run your business you probably will not be in business long .
No stars , just negative !
Do not recommend !
Went with a running vehicle , now it will not start !
I absolutely do not recommend ever taking your car to tnt off 91st and northern .
All about making a buck , i mean who care s if your vehicle will not start after the service they did , 3 days later and here we are .
Never again !
He saw us standing by him and did not acknowledge us for a good while .
You will not regret it .
Do not forget the dessert !
Even when i pulled out my calculator to prove it to him , he still would not acknowledge it and continued to give attitude .
It was our first time there , but will definitely never come back or recommend to friends , train your servers to work on their customer service skills .
Been here twice and there has never been too many people .
Best cajun food in town , not just from a truck .
Phoenix does not have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so i was amazed at food truck friday to find jamburrito .
I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice ... not in one sitting because the portions are very filling .
We got seated and then patiently waited for someone to take our order and no one came so we had to ask to order .
No one asked us if we would like another drink or brought more water when we were out .
The place was busy but being a small restaurant not unmanageable .
This may be a " chain type " store , but this is not your run of the mill pizza .
You will not be disappointed ... give barrio's a try , they are worth it !
Okay ..... the pork was not bbq it was raw , warmed meat .... the chicken was chewy looking and undercooked , the shrimp looked warmed as well .
I did not even eat it .
I am allergic to crab and i hope they did not cook it in the same oil ... my husband ordered the veggie with tofu meal ... it s called the buddha delight .
I am reporting them to action 13 news or something because honestly i do not think they are up to code .
Do not know what you want ?
It 's not too downtown - hipster and did i mention the selection ??
Had the following dishes i will not go into much detail rather i am just going to explain what was enjoyed salmon belly crudo spicy crispy shrimp cauliflower soup sunchoke ravioli john dory beef wellington .
I personally can not but even then it s not a bad deal .
They have plenty of flavours so it s understandable that there will be plenty of flavours you might not enjoy and plenty that you might .
That being said , they are definitely not the best wings around but the variety alone makes up for it in my opinion .
There was no fan in the bathroom and the room was laid out kinda odd with multiple entrances .
No problem .
This is the 3rd time in a row now that i have gotten my van back only to find that they did not vacuum my smaller mats or bother to move any of them aside to vacuum under them .
The third time in a row they did not spray the air freshener that comes with my package or wipe out the cup holders .
Of course , management is always like , " please let us know & we will fix it ! " but i do not have the time or patience to do that every single time i take my car to have it washed .
No thanks .
I honestly had not considered the potential of creolexian until now .
I am fairly convinced jamburrito can do no wrong .
The lobby was very attractive , the staff was extremely helpful , and the food ( especially omaha steak house -- some of the best salmon ever , no lie ) was awesome .
Not a big deal during the day , but it 's a different story at night .
It was very busy , which is not a surprise .
He was not familiar with the travelzoo offer so he got his manager to come to the table to explain how things would work .
Both of them could not be nicer .
No utensils even after we got our food , trash on top of the trash .
Also the bathroom sink was not working so could not really wash my hands .
This last time no one would take my car to do the maintenance .
No one ever came so i left .
We were ushered in and informed there was " no cover charge " for us and that tables were reserved for bottle service only .
Long story short , customer service is not very good ... but they did a good job on my car ...
The place has gotten to be dirty , less friendly and most of all it does not have very good food .
We have made a decision not to visit this place any more based on our last 5 visits it so .
Not sure how loud or busy this place gets during a weekday hh or friday evening , but it was very chill on sunday .
I probably order from ld every weekend .. always fast , fresh and delicious .. pad thai and chef 's hong kong noodles are fantastic .. when i am visiting my daughter the first idea is " let 's order lil dumpling .. " you will not be disappointed .
The decour is kind of old but do not let that scare you , food is fantastic and the service is a+.
I am not really impressed with banh mi boys .
Decided to give them another go and tried the kimchi fries recently and thought it was not too bad but nothing to rave over .
It was not hot enough for me but the kimchi added a unexpected spiciness to it that i did like .
Overall , my opinion has not really changed .
Luckily i do not live too close to this restaurant otherwise i 'd start looking like a bao :d
Get two because you will be sorry you did not when you are down to your last bite .
I tend to pre order on ritual because sometimes i can not find parking nearby and need to do a quick hop off hop on kinda deal .
I can not think of anything negative or suggestions for improvement either .
Will no longer recommend this place .
The food 's not terrible but the problem is when you order a meat dish such as mongolian beef you get about 5 pieces of beef and then they mask the rest of it with the onions and bell pepper so you think you are getting a big meal .
This small lounge is a great place to chill and grab drinks if you are not in the mood for a club .
There are very few bike parking options and only street parking , so they should look at installing a bike rack ( maybe not possible , but as a bike i 'd really appreciate it ! )
They were not busy , so the lady actually brought me my sandwich , but the lady who prepared my coffee left it at the bar , which i found odd especially because she never told me and i did not notice it for some time , which resulted in a lukewarm brew .
The tastes were decent and they had a good selection , but the preparations were not the freshest and the prices were steep .
Not sure if i will be back .
I do not enjoy writing bad reviews , but this place was just horrible .
Alas , we had to look no further than our front door step as ' the big cheese ' looked so promising .
My boyfriend took the first bite ( sneaky ) and gushed ' wow , that 's hot ' and not hot as in temperature hot .
They were burnt ( both me and my boyfriend had several black fries in our ' poutine ' , and if they were not blackened they were the bits of fries that no one wants to eat anyway - obviously been sitting in the botton of the deep fryer for 10 years .
For those with little patience ( which i completely understand having just wasted three hours of my life at edge steakhouse ) : do not eat here !
The steak is great , as you would expect for any $ 70 + steak , most everything else is good but not mind blowing .
They did have a few other large parties come in , but they were not full , and this is frickin vegas .
If you can not handle it when it 's busy literally stay out of the kitchen , and the dining room too .
Truffle fries were not as good as the ones i had two days ago at umami burger .
Dessert ( 7layer chocolate cake ) was good , no more .
My water glass did not get refilled for the last 50 minutes i sat there !!!
Of course , he did not tell us that until he brought the bills .
I only kept my mouth shut to not cause a scene with business associates .
@wackywings #yelpgta #chickenwings #aycewings surprised that i have not reviewed this place .
But this girl ai not that trashy .
So that sharing thing is not happening .
You can only imagine no air conditioning on the hottest week of the year thus far in sc !
So many people have told me how amazing the hoagies are here and i can not believe it took me this long to finally give it a try !
Triangle is not a fancy establishment but i totally appreciate that .
You can not start a tab , so we had to up three times to pay for our coffees , then our breakfast and finally some jam and a dessert .
When the server dropped off our food , she did not say a word .
They do not offer any alternatives to bacon ( e.g. , sausage , sliced tomatoes , etc. ) and do not poach eggs .
It did not come with any sides .
The consensus was that everything tasted okay / good but we will not be going back .
Texas toast blackened catfish sandwich that day , they did not have anymore fried catfish .
I almost said nevermind , but i am so glad i did not .
It was a while ago so i can not remember everything on it , but their cajun sauce i definitely remember .
I have not had catfish seasoned and fried this well since her .
A better job could not have been done here .
I am not a frequent food truck customer , so i am not sure what an average wait time should be .
However , i did not mind the wait because of the kind of food they were pumping out of there .
I do not mind .
Also by the time i got my beer it had no head on it -- criminal .
Even after having to come find her to get my beer the first time , she never returned to see if i wanted another drink .
She also never returned to see if we wanted food , even though we had asked for menus .
I can not believe my boyfriend tipped her .
After five minutes with no service we were going to leave and eat somewhere else , but we managed to get a server who was really good / quick and that made the experience a touch more positive .
( blonde girl , smart and friendly . ) management was either off that night , or they need to seriously kick some ass , if mine is not the only comment on here about the disastrously non-existent service .
You can not beat 4.75 for pizza and unlimited drinks .
Would not bother returning .
I have not been there in a few years .
I am just not a fan of chinese food anymore because i dislike panda express too .
My husband and i shared it and was to go try another place after this so did not want to be too full ( but we ended up pretty full anyways lol ) .
Granted i do not know what real canadian poutine tastes like , but i have had poutine elsewhere which was much better .
Does not even look like they cleaned my leather seats as there 's dog hair still on them too .
Never going back and i suggest anyone else finds another place to wash their car or do detail work .
I will never eat pizza hut again after tasting barro's .
If it was not for the uye last night i probably would have never stepped foot into wacky wings .
I enjoyed all of the flavours except the buttermilk dill ... not a fan of dairy flavours on chicken .
The wings were not small in size and the flavouring were great !
Can not come here without having the lounge fries .
I have been to the other locations and love the laid back vibe , great service and extensive beer / cider / wine menu ... and luckily , this location is no different .
Chico's is within easy biking distance from my house , so we end up going here when we are starving and not wanting to drive any place .
One complaint - can not we get some actually spicy salsa ?
Lots of choices and the people are so polite , do not take advantage of that .
Even if you are richer , or higher on the social scale , treat the people here with respect no matter what .
1st thing i usually check in any restaurant is the bathroom sadly this one was horrid urinal was about to fall off the wall and looks like it has not been cleaned in years maybe .
Only problem is place is so popular it 's rare that it 's not packed .
You can not go wrong here
Love the food ..... never an issue .
The wine , not great .
The food was delicious - it really was - i am not the biggest fan of italian restaurants only because meat and cheese and pasta together , tend to work :)
They do not replace items as much as i think they should so i find that some of the food taste lets just say not so fresh .
I would also suggest only going on the weekend or when they are busy because they do not replace the food at all on the weekdays when it s not busy .
No explanation from managers , no concern from workers .
When i got out of the wash i immediately pulled over to make sure there was not any damage to my car .
Luckily there was not , but this was the most unprofessional place i have ever been .
Beware and do not use this place
I would not recommend the tacos or the calamari banh mi , but the grilled pork banh mi is another great option .
I have not had lunch or dinner there .
Do not get their carne asada burrito from the lunch / dinner menu .
" got two dollars ? " not only did he ask every table , he systematically asked every person personally at each table .
Management did not even blink an eye , they allowed this smelly hobo to harrass everyone in the place .
This review does not mean a thing because this place is in the heart of business district , and working people will grab a bite to eat without checking reviews .
But i feel better knowing i will never go back there again , and hopefully will prevent people from being disappointed and harrassed by smelly bums during their lunch break .
Oh , and they do not let hardcore drinkers lay their head down on the bar for a quick nap any more either .
I do not know why anyone buys a sandwich ring from a supermarket when for half the cost you can have a better quality sandwich that 's even bigger .
Even my wife , who is such a non-foodie she never cares where we go to eat or what we eat , is jazzed if i offer to grab a battleship before i head home from work .
And that trip adds 15 miles to my commute home so it 's not a visit of convenience .
I hope they never change .
I am not eating there for atmosphere .
I will not be back .
Having been here before , regardless of the fact that their food by no means is standout , we figured we 'd give their dumplings a shot as they were the closest place we could think of that had dumplings .
This is an order which by no means should take a long time as most of it just involved boiling the preprepared meals .
I never had anticipated waiting that long as my previous experiences there were never this busy nor hectic .
The hot and sour soup was alright considering there 's really not many options out in the henderson area .
They simply were way too understaffed and did not have the decency of forewarning their diners that there would be an incredibly long wait .
This is not a place i would recommend if you are looking for a nice meal that you will be at least satisfied with what you paid for .
Chicken was super hard ( old most likely ) and dark , could not eat it .
They have a wide selection of great craft beer on tap -- i got an ipa , but i will have to try the mystery / sample tray next time as there were quite a few i had never heard of .
We missed happy hour ( all the way to 8 pm , so we did not really have an excuse ) by a few minutes , but the bartender still hooked us up - i would give five stars just for that !
Not bad for a lounge .
The booming music is a bit deceptive and made me want to dance a bit in my seat , but it 's not a club , so that might not have been well received .
It was a good first stop and i 'd probably go back if i am in vegas again and can not figure out where i feel like going .
Might be back to try some other poutine , but will not be soon , and will not be often .
This place is disgusting the food is horrible do not waste your money .
They do not have a variety and what they do have it 's under cook poorly made
Very tasty breakfast sandwich and cappuccino , but at $ 12 for the small portion with only two bits of melon as a side , i will not be coming here often , which is unfortunate because the vibe and ingredients are great .
I did not bother to tell him and ate it anyway .
This is a beer and wine bar only so keep that in mind -- no cocktails .
They have a few small plates like this but no real food menu .
Would not come back again , but would recommend it to someone looking for just drinks , not food .
They have gluten free options for both mains and dessert that are not a compromise .
We love it but we do not take fancy people there .
Do not be lured in by the $ 1.29 tacos , go somewhere else .
My 3 tacos came out and i did not quite know what i was looking at .
The shredded beef was mushy , no flavor .
Chicken texture was ok , but no flavor .
Mushy as hell , no flavor at all .....
My issues are the layout is a bit odd and you can not see the draft list completely from anywhere at the bar .
We had 4 people at the bar and you had to get up and walk over to anyone who was not right next to you to be heard .
I will never go back .
The room is amazing , we stayed on the second floor so our view was not all that amazing but the room was so win / win .
There 's a restaurant / bar across the street called the locker room and it 's worth the walk over especially if you just touched down and do not want to go anywhere right away .
I promise you will not regret it !!
Yes , they are kids doing what kids do best but this is a hotel not their home .
I personally thought it was unsafe cause eventually they was not in their parents eyesight , i think most of the parents were in the room whole the kids roam the hotel .
Today , we have crazy people so letting them run around the hotel and having other people pretty much watch them is not a good idea cause for one they did not come to babysit .
Room service does not really replenish towels like that .
This place does not have a good reputation but i was in a hurry .
This was no problem on the phone but now it was .
Since i would not pay for the full detailing he would have to charge another twenty dollars because of the pee .
The handwritten slip he gave me did not match the receipt .
Your employee who answered the phone did so with no respect and a all around poor attitude .
The car was not cleaned as promised inside or out .
You do not understand my complaint ?
I went to get a car wash and the started selling me things that i did not even want but they gave me a good deal on transmission flush , oil change , and headlights cleaning .
When i went to pick up my car nothing was done the three step buffing was not done i do not even think they did the oil change and the transmission flush .
I told the representative which did not have any customer service he told me well you can not have your keys without paying the $ 200 .
No manager was on duty .
Do n't go here do n't waste your money !
You may not find your favorite cut of meet , but you will find quality .
They mail me a coupon with there name and address on it and then do not want to take it .
I say , it does not have an expiration date on it .
Ok she says with total attitude , next time we will not take it .
I say ok , next time do not mail out coupons with no expiration date and next time i will just go to red dragon .
For those that love poutine do yourself a favour and do not eat here .
( it s not hard to deep fry potatoes and order curds in from quebec ) and that is to make a great gravy and wow do they ever miss .
My friend tried one with the peppercorn gravy which was also - not so good .
I was stoked to go , but will not go back .
I do not like it one bit !!
And i am honestly pretty attractive so i was extra pissed at this bc it would have never happened back home in chicago .
Just a note .... the delicious gnocchi is not substantial in the halibut dish so i suggest ordering a side dish as well .
Not the typical chinesse restraunt you are greeted and taken care by a very very cheery staff that make you feel at home .
I had a breakfast burrito from here a while back and did not really care for it , so i was hesitant to give them another shot .
I can not believe this thing is only $ 7 .
I had not eaten breakfast and was starving .
Not only did it fill me up , but it kept me full until dinner .
The only thing i did not like is it was a little too messy .
This is not the best waffle house in the area .
When we got our food it was not comparable to other waffle house restaurants .
My friend got her hash browns first ( which were not as good as other locations ) then 5 minutes later i got my biscuits and gravy .
We would not go to this one again .
Pros : - a wide variety of wing flavours ( different sauces , seasonings and spices ) - large location with large tv 's for great game day watching - wednesdays is all you can eat and you can try different flavours throughout your stay cons : - all you can eat wednesdays are always packed with people and you could be waiting for a table for hours - waitresses are not the most welcoming .
Went to check this place out on a friday night around 830 , sort of busy , got seated , started getting food and noticed half of these trays were empty , i asked 2 employees if they were going to put more food out since they did not close until 1030 they both said yes , 20 min later , nothing .
I asked to speak to a manager and so she came and i asked if they were planning on putting more food out she stated that we would have to ask her specifically to put food out and i said i heard 2 other customers ask for more food , she smiled and said no one has asked me , so she then proceeds to asks what " items " i would like more of and i pointed out 3 trays , and 35 minutes later she only had 1 out , we then left , very dissatisfied and paid $ 60 for 2 adults and 3 children .
Never again .
If you do not like this place , go back to scottsdale !
I swear it 's like the size of my room , not exagerrating at all .
Old men hit on me , me no likey .
No tip for them .
Grrrr , took 30 mins to get drinks so we double - fisted since we did not want to wait another 30 mins to get more drinks .
When i come back to vegas , you will not find me here .
Except it was not a mere grinder ...
After not having had a battleship in 7 or so years , i found that it s quality had not wavered .
But unlike most italian restaurants in north york this place does not have pizza , they have couple pastas and some mains .
It is a short menu with not too many choices , but enough for you to think about what you want before you order .
Our server highly recommended the lasagna and it did not disappoint us .
No apology before hurrying away .
I tried nachos first and i do not know how you screw up nachos but they did .
I asked the bartender for a pizza , she could see that i barely ate the nachos , but she did not ask if anything was wrong .
The braised short ribs were delicious but the root vegetables that it was served with were not good at all .
We did not even have time for dessert and had already been there for 2 hours .
I did not think much of this , since other buffets do this , until we watched as other families after us were kindly greeted and quickly taken to their tables .
The food was better than we expected , especially the sushi , but it would have been much better had the staff not treated us as if we were some kids , up to no good , who would run out of the restaurant without paying .
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a family or simply anyone who looks over the age of 21 since they will not provide good service if they think you will run out on the bill , which is why they will make only you pay before you can even sit down .
They are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me , i can never eat more than two ( which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks , but who can beat $ 3 for lunch with leftovers ? ) .
The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken , the steak just is not very flavorful , i definitely would not recommend them .
I have never tried the beef , which come on a crisp taco shell .
I tend to prefer soft tacos over hard tacos , so i have not really been interested in trying the beef .
I would not really recommend coming to chico 's unless its for the dollar tacos .
It 's on me that i did not inspect my car before i drove off , but i do not feel i should have to do that .
Of course the serving size is generous , i usually make it a point to not finish the plate , it 's so big .
But what makes these better then most is first the cheese , love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on .
The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that does not hit a spot , but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind !
Staff here has always been nice , i have never had an order go wrong , never had an issue on quality or consistency .
This happens to insure that the contents do not spill out of the tortilla !
It all tastes very authentic , and i love that i can easily make it vegan since they do not add any secrets into their food .
I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream , and they have never once slipped up on this !
I can never get enough .
Although i hate strip malls , i am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid .
A chinese place that does not suck in henderson , and they offer thai food too !
With a house full of hungry people wanting chinese food and not wanting another lame experience i turned to yelp !
35 . sweet and sour chicken - premium chicken , great flavor , no skimpy food here .
General tso 's chicken - my wife puts me to shame when it comes to being a critic and when she says it does not suck and she smiles from ear to ear ... yeah , this one made my house happy let me tell ya . 8 . pot sticker - omg .
These ai not the crappy potstickers other places try and stick you with .
This ai not the cream cheese wontons that other places call crab rangoon .
This is the good stuff . 9 . chicken teriyaki on a stick - good , enjoyable , will order again , but not my personal favorite .
If you can not find it go to walgreens and use their driveup pharmacy lanes .
4 stars ... do not want to jinx them with a 5 , i will save that last star for a review of their thai offerings .
You will not be disappointed .
Not overpriced - they fare with other buffets in the county .
You will not be disappointed .
There was sooo much food neatly wrapped up in the oversize tortilla ( burrito ) that i could not wait to dig in .
Some of the dry seasonings are okay , but the taste never seems to be consistent so i stick to my one flavour .
The service is alright , never horrible but also never great .
We love the embassy suites and this one was no exception .
Although the atrium is under construction , the room was great , all new furniture , amazing bed with great pillows , etc ... but the room was not the best part .
Markus tate , the front desk staff member who checked us in last night and was still around this morning when we headed out , overheard me suggest to my wife that we take an uber to the airport since one of the hotel shuttles was not running .
I do not know how long markus has worked at the embassy suites , or if he is already in a management role , but he should be put into a management training program or into a management role because he truly set the bar in terms of outstanding customer service .
My boyfriend and i started coming to this place a few months back and now we just can not stay away !
We are never disappointed and always leave feeling full .
You are also a fool if you do not get the kimchi fries ... a fool i tell you .
( i am not sure why , but the more tattoos the sandwich maker has , the better the hoagie tastes . ) yeah , the neighborhood leaves a lot to be desired .
Not even close .
Had take out but i will say the fries were soggy and definitely not the best poutine i have had
Okay , i admit that i have never eaten here before 2:00 am and in any sort of clear mind , but that does not take away from the greatness of the big cheese .
I am not an aficionado , but i can tell that the cheese ' curds ' may not be official , however it still makes a good meal and snack .
They have a condiment station with extra spices and what not to make it the way you like .
If you do not like salty stuff might not enjoy it as much parking is hard to find since it 's at 17th ave the serving look small but it 's enough eat for the regular size they put lots of meat in it too which is good .
There were not many options for a picky 4 year old at food truck friday this week , but jamburritos delivered .
I can not say much about the waffle because ... well , i could not eat it .
Anyone else would probably appreciate the bacon , but i do not eat pork .
Minus one star because the menu did not specify bacon was on the dish i ordered and because a cheese crisp should never be $ 5 ( even though it was pretty big ) .
I am not sure a business could be run more poorly than this place .
Do not fall for the new owner / new management signs , seem to do this quite often and the workers / service never changes .
How can a steak cost $ 70 and not even be waygu or kobe .
We are not poor or cheap people , but we will not be going to the steakhouse anymore .
So if you want any of those things do not come here .
And then of course i paid for my car wash after shooing him off and did not receive a receipt .
I have had my car for many years and i never pushed in my mirrors anytime i have ever had a car wash and i think that he should have asked for permission before he went and pushing my mirrors .
Let 's just say i will not be going back .
If she is not she should be fired or have a formal complaint with the labor commission .
It is a not thier strength when you compare it the the pork belly or real confit which is biased in duck fat for three hours .
For the first , we were actually lucky enough to be staying in the bellagio ( do not even ask me how that happened , but it was divine ! ) .
We ended up leaving soon after because we wanted to dance ( they were playing some excellent 80s music in here , but there just was not enough room to shake it ) - but who knows what other fun we could have had at caramel ?
The drink prices are pretty steep - i paid $ 23 pre-tip for a glass of wine and a vodka / tonic - but there 's no cover to get in , so that 's a big plus .
Most of which are made in the premises ... not bad .
Personally i would not come out of my way to come here .
Unless a few of us decided to come out , guess the place is just too far away if you are not a local .
The location is perfect , not much businesses around so parking spots is accessible .
Although my service took 2 hours for pedicure + gel manicure and not busy at all .
I do not like to mess with my poutine .
I got the traditional , nothing fancy no gimmicks .
Honestly some of the tastiest sandwiches in the city at prices you can not beat .
Standard sandwiches are served on a long baguette , nice and crisp bread with fresh veggies and delicious meats no matter what you choose .
Unfortunately i had not read the poor service experience someone else had also encountered beforehand .
Maybe it was my grungy look that put them off , but this is not the way to treat a customer .
Never mind i asked it for here and waited for my drink .
I will not be back .
I wanted to give them the whole customer is always right speech but alas it would be lost here as i am not their customer and i am sure there are plenty of places that will take my money .
Yummy who does not love pizza ?!?
What 's sad is that sometimes it 's delicious , but other times it 's not .
I hope they find their weak link and take care of it because we love having them so close for nights when i do not feel like cooking or do not have time .
I absolutely can not stand that plastic bagged lettuce smell .
Husband and i had the basic some pizza and wings nothing too exciting calm location not a lot of people which was good because the wait was short .
I am not too keen on chinese food buffets even though i love chinese food .
Extreme wash car still dirt and they could not put the antenna back on .
There is plenty of seating so no worries there .
I would not hesitate coming back here for more when i have that chinese food craving !
You can never go wrong with a pork banh mi sandwich and of course top it off with the kimchi fries .
The staff seemed sweet but they were not very customer service oriented .
I will never eat here again .
I should preclude this review by saying i am not really a fan of poutine .
The box amazingly did not get soaked through with all that was in there .
Good waffles , i guess they should have since that 's what their name is .... lol asked for crispy bacon but not as the way i like it .
Did not need the pasta .
There is not anything special about it .
We easily found parking ( although it was not necessarily close but this allowed us to burn off some calories haha ) we were promptly seated and had a great server named adam .
What 's great is if your not eating all you can eat the rest of the table is still allowed to do so unlike some other wing joints in the gta .
The conveniently located wings joint is a must try if you have not done so already !!!!
Since i was a child , wor wonton soup has been a requirement any time i am not feeling well .
I arrived to pick up the food a few minutes before it was ready - and was surprised to see spring rolls in the order which i had not asked for .
I have never felt welcomed by the staff .
With all of great cafés in the area , this one is not worth your time or money .
The veggie one was reasonable but not particularly tasty .
Finally after about 25 minutes of waiting , i asked one of the girls behind the counter what was going on , and she never gave me a clear answer - just mumbled something to the cooks and all of a sudden my food magically appeared .
If i had not opened my mouth , i 'd probably still be waiting for my food .
After all that , they were not even anything major to write home about - the soft taco shells tasted a little raw , and the fillings were decent , but again , nothing to brag about .
It did not seem that they were short staffed , but with such a fast and busy lunch crowd , i expected better .
Do not think i 'd go out of my way to come back anytime soon .
The trucks are parked close to my school , so we got there quickly , and there was tons of parking , and no lines to wait in .
When we arrived , there was such a variety , i was not sure what to pick .
I chose to go to jamburritos and did not regret my choice .
I will return and this time , my choice will not be difficult ; i will go to jamburritos !
Best spot in phoenix , you are an idiot if you do not drop in : ) great atmosphere with a stellar beer and wine selection .
I like spice so i was a bit disappointed that the habanero sauce was not spicy and the amount of sauce they had put on the wings did not cover the entirety of the wings .
What 's not to love !?
If you can not finish your first batch , you can take the rest home .
After that , there 's no take - homes .
So ... not that hot .
There really was not anything " mexican " about that bowl , except that they added some shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream to the top .
I liked this a lot , but next time i 'd ask for no sour cream .
There are often a lot of kids around , so if you do not like having kids around , this probably is not the place for you .
They let parents get hammered in front of their kids but do not allow any uptempo music .
Would never come here or recommend to any friends or family .
I hope the atrium gets redone to looks similar to what it was before and does not try to go modern like the ayrsley location .
My biggest issue was that the wifi did not work and they could not really figure out why , and i was connected to some national tech support .
I did not have the time so i just went to bed .
No , they do not even offer wings .
I am sorry to say that it was not all i 'd hoped for .
Not cool .
I suggested few locations , not including 7 numbers , however my friend told me that it is a great place , and it is definitely worth it , particularly the family share meal .
Finding the restaurant is not a problem , and as for parking goes , one can park on the side streets behind the restaurant .
The noise level was average , and this place is definitely for a date , as i think one can not hear another .
The price for this is $ 34 per person , not including gratuities of course .
We told the server that i am vegetarian , and he assured me that there is no need to worry , as most of the dishes are vegetarian .
To start we had the calamari , of course i did not touch this , the pepperoni ( no not meat - roasted red peppers with arugula and goat cheese ) and the caprese .
It did not take long for this to come , and my taste buds sure had a memorable feeling .
I guess you really can not mess up the above , either way , it was tasty .
The lasagne , i did not have , as it was made with ground veal .
I have never had pasta like this before in my life , and i can definitely vouch for it .
Last but not least , the secondi .
It looked like the traditional eggplant parmigiana , but it was not .
If someone who is reading this does not like the aftertaste of egg in their mouth , or rather noticing the huge taste , this dish is definitely not for you .
Heck , even the pasta you could not taste the egg flavour to it .
Go in you will not be disappointed .
The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore .
Was not offensive .
I will not be back .
I can not wait to try the rest of their menu !
Yea it 's ok ... not bad , not good ... ok .
$ 12.95 for dinner on friday prob cuz they had crab legs , which looked small we did not try them , and they had shrimp and fish .
The sushi display was nice and the size of the sushi was not as a big roll like a californian rolls elsewhere , it was a perfect size for sushi in my taste .
The vegetables was great , it was not too soft or overcooked .
Ps : no cash back ( incase you wonder ; ) )
Their gf pizza is not good and very expensive .
I would not recommend the gluten free pizza .
Not our ideal pizza , not our favorite pizza but it 's good enough for when on the run .
Only got a car wash but i do not plan on going anywhere else !
The only thing is they do not serve liquor .
I am usually not a beer person but the atmosphere here is just awesome .
Their hours are great because they are open late and never rush you out or close early .
Honestly it sucked and i feel like i got ripped off - not to mention all the apologies and feeling like a horrible host to my friends .
I called back and explained , but they seemed like high school phone girls who do not understand i can care less about getting a discount on my next purchase because i am not going to order this ever again .
I have had celery before , but celery in a plain brown bag ( with no container just a dirty ragged brown bag ) is a first for me .
As much as this placed made me nauseated and they can not take the horrid taste out of my mouth they did reach a new low for me in terms of pizza / service .
No please avoid .
Do not order the horrible milkshakes .
If you are miserable work somewhere where you do not have to deal with living people .
Was not that great .
I would definitely not go back .
I would have given this place negative stars , since i can not they get one star .
We had not even made an attempt to get dessert , so my patience was running really thin with her .
Myself or my family will never visit this overpriced dump again .
Spending your hard earned money in establishments where your presence appears to be more of a nuisance is asinine , that is the reason they can sit on an spicy egg roll because i will never dine here again .
Did not know if it was just our tolerance / ability to consumption large volumes of alc but the 80oz disappeared sooner than we thought .
Apparently , the waitress in - charge of our table was a noob but that should not be an excuse .
For someone that is particular ; i can not find one negative about this hotel .
I did not know what to expect but this place delivered .
The pool , fitness center , cooked to order breakfast , two room suites and much more is no false advertisement .
We did not get an opportunity to enjoy the complimentary drinks and reception but i saw it being set up and it looked pretty awesome .
Would be nice to have a table to sit at - all tables were not bussed and there was a big spill in the floor with a sign that was not attended to for 15 min .
Too bad , because any table that was not filled with - dishes was not clean / wiped off - filled w crumbs or grease . :(
I did my research before writing this review to see if there was a connection between the two businesses but there does not seem to be .
There 's only one thing different here : the poutine is not as good .
My first trip here was in early june , not long after they opened .
The fries were soggy and the gravy was not hot enough to melt the cheese .
The fries were better and the cheese melted but it still did not taste that great .
I 'd probably give the poutine here a solid three stars , but never anything more .
I ordered the steam bun with panko crusted tofu ( it was very flavourful ) as well as the jicama&papaya slaw , i loved the spicy dressing ( but if your not into spice , alone would have tasted good too ) .
I can not wait to try the kalbi beef and grilled chicken next ...
I am not sure why there are so many comments about how the food is not mind blowing .
The seating is spaced out so that you do not feel like you are intruding on your neighbour 's conversation .
I did not feel like i had just been parachuted into hipsterville or the land of toddlers . would certainly make a return trip .
Not worth staying at all , id rather go to hyatt or renaissance just next door next time im here .
And yes , all of that fit , i just had to pile it high , but they do not care , which is why i love it !
I really can not give enough love to whining pig .
Ordered the all star special with a pecan waffle no toast .
I took some food out at this location many years ago and it was not memorable and i never went back .
Well not here at little dumplings , not only is there a very very generous amount , but they are pretty darn tasty too !
The chef back there knows what his is doing , this is not not a panda place , no no not at all .
The restaurant is not fancy , you can dine in , but it s very casual .
Not only that , for a dish that listed beef as the first or second ingredient , there was none .
Asked for vegetarian nachos ... no meat .
No problem i thought just take them back and he will make it right .
Not very nice .
No one was wearing hair net 's and some employs were not even wearing gloves wall handeling food .
I was quite surprised to find my car still had not come through and there were no cars or people there .
3 guys started working on my car , then one got in and drove off , i was shocked , he took it to go through again , but did not bother saying anything to me .
I asked how i knew i would not have to wait as long for the same service and she said she would let them know to get me through quickly .
I explained the story to him and he said well we can do it , but it will not be fast , we are busy today .
I could tell there were a lot of people there today and i was not expecting it to be 10 minutes or anything , but the fact that i had already waited 30 minutes the day before and that the manger had promised quick service should have meant that they would try and get me in and out as quickly as possible .
Instead he told me right off the bat that it would not be quick .
I called back and they said barbara was not in today , so i decided to write a review instead .
I waited and waited and waited for 2 hours until i had no more patience .
So i walk in ask what 's taking so long and i am accompanied back to my car to explain that it 's so hard to clean up dog hair and they could not have finished any faster .
He also talked down to me saying that i should not have asked for a time estimate from the cashier and i should have gone to him .
I am not going to lie i was mad but okay , i get it , it was a mess , so i take my keys and pull out .
I will never come back to this carwash that can not even handle cleaning a car .
Ten minutes later he was back asking me , no telling me that i have to leave .
There was no talking to him , he was on a mission to have me leave .
When we walked in we were not greeted .
This was my first and only visit to a waffle house , so i had no idea what to expect .
Inside of car was not wiped down at all still dust all over dashboard ... it looked like they did try to wipe out cup holders but left sitting water or cleaner still inside .
I can honestly say that i will not go to another nail shop !
You will not be disappointed .
The sushi was okay , but not exceptional .
No shrimp sauce on a sushi bar ?
Then there 's the cost .... dinner was over $ 24 for my husband and myself , and we did not even have drinks , just water .
We will not be back .
I am not usually a sandwich person but was told that this was a must try in pittsburgh .
It did not disappoint at all because i inhaled it like it was nothing .
I can not say enough great things about this restaurant .
I went to an event a couple weekends back where this truck was working , but it was not as great as when i have previously had their food .
Still good , but not as good .
Not too bad overall though !
I liked the rice and coconut shrimp , waiters were friendly and no wait to sit down
I love waffle house even when i am not drunk and it 's been many years since i was in college .
When we were at the airport , they did not care very much that we were outside freezing .
Second issue was that we requested a 7 am wake up call so we do not miss our early morning flight , and one was never given to us .
And while this is not the hotel 's fault , we had kids either next to us or above us that were jumping up and down off the bed and laughing at full strength around midnight for about 2 hours .
No ... it is a warm bed and a roof for the night and that is it .
It never has and based on that experience alone will never be a good place for a car wash .
Ordered the hamburger with hash browms , they do not have fries .
There was no fork to eat the hash browns , no napkins , and no ketchup .
He explained about the restaurant and how we came at the perfect time as the extraordinary ( my words not his , lol ) chef steve had just created a new spring menu .
Next course was the english pea soup with morel mushrooms , mind you i am not a fan of mushrooms but i had to try it , and was i surprised as to how amazing it was !
The lobster mac & cheese had the right amount of cheese and lobster , not too much of either , so yummy !!!
My boyfriend has the john dory , a fish i have never tried before , but was it absolutely delicious !!!!
We wrapped up the meal with the vanilla bean creme brulle , which i have never really been a fan of at other restaurants , chef steve has officially changed my mind on that , at least at the edge steakhouse anyways !
All light and not filling so you could enjoy the rest of the meal .
Next up gazpacho with king crab , now i am not much a fan of gazpacho but wow !
I am spoiled now , between the perfection of the temperature of the meat and the foie gras paired with the wellington i will not be able to enjoy it anywhere else !!!
I had never been to a waffle house .
One complaint is the waffle was not that hot and cooled off .
I have not had poutine in well over fifteen years , so i decided that i should order the traditional poutine rather than venture outside of the box on my first visit .
The kalbi beef is decent quality and not full of fat .
We went the night before 4th of july at around midnight and it was not very crowded .
The music was spot on , and while it was loud , it was not loud enough where we could not carry on a conversation .
When i opened up the box , i thought that they gave me the wrong meal because whatever that food was , it was not pad see ewe .
There was no sauce like the traditional pad see ewe has , and no large flat noodles either .
I called them to ask for a refund because they did not give me pad see ewe , and instead of apologizing and giving me a refund , the manager argued with me and told me that 's the way that they make pad see ewe , and that i can not get my money back , only a credit for my next order .
If you want real thai food , do not go here !
Look , it 's by no means " chicago - style " pizza , but hey , it 's excellent pizza .
Never a wait , interesting toppings for the walk up slices .
I did not know it was mostly a take out place but once i was there decided to give it a try anyhow .
I do not buy it .
I made the mistake not to snag a table / reserve it by putting my bag down , and someone took my table after i 'd paid for my food !
This is not as much of a problem if it 's not busy .
No server came to greet us for a good 15 min and it was not until we flagged someone down that they realized we were there .
The sweet potato fries were mediocre so i would not get them again overall the food was good so i would not mind going again on a game night .
But if you want steller service , well this is not the place to go to .
I was able to do late check out with no hassle ( ended up not needing it ) .
I was not acknowledged as a hilton honors member and the latin lady doing the checking in was very dismissive , constantly checking her phone and almost rude .
She did not tell me about the happy hour , had to ask where my room and elevators were located .
But overall her lack of customer service did not dampen my stay there !
I have ever had and i am not a real mexican fan .
It 's not a pretty part of the city and odd to find a place so cute and well stocked at lazy daisy .
I was really touched about how they took time to explain everything they had on their menu that i did not understand and also ensure our vegan member of the party was aware of all their vegan friendly options .
I am not sure i 'd want to head here into the evening because while the art on the wall by local artisans lend to the urban - hip feel , the cash for gold type places across the street do not have the same je ne c'est quoi .
The staff there is decent , they were not overly helpful but not downright rude either .
I was a little put off the first time i went there because their credit card machine was down and so they asked to write down my card information and charge me the following day ( but in the end that 's exactly what they did and i did not have any issues with it ) .
Again a little overpriced for what i got but they were not terrible .
We returned to wacky wings after saying we would not go back ...
We have only gone here to celebrate someones birthday we would not go here to just have dinner .. both parties we have gone to have had a separate little party area which is nice because it s private .. so this place is one star .
Such as no forks and knifes , meals taking forever to get out ( they ended up just canceling their order ) bringing out fish and taking 40 min to bring tartar sauce ...
Looked like no name kd made poorly .. the noodles were clumped together cheese in clumps .. just gross .. came with side of sweet potato fries , and by side i mean 5 fries ... the dessert there s no choice unless you pay extra .. it s a pre packaged cookie in a bag .. again gross ..

The response we got was " it s in the back of restaurant near the kitchen " so now we have our one year old all packed up and we have to mission back threw a busy bar .. no thanks forget it .
Totally not worth 70 $.
No taste .
But on a beautiful spring afternoon , it 's not a bad thing .
There is nothing worse than a burrito that has too much of one ingredient or not enough of another ..
I never really understood the importance of ambiance correlating with the taste of the food .
That night though we could not stop talking about this place .
Do not order to go here .
I have not been to the triangle for more than 20 years , but have told my husband about it many times ( the place i used to go in college with friends late at night that had amazing hoagies named after ships - destroyers , battleship , etc. ) .
He had never been there and never heard of the triangle .
I just hope i do not have to wait another 20 years for my next one .
I really was not tasting anything that i would associate with jambalaya , and thought the chicken may have been a little undercooked .
The only thing he tried that i would not was the clams .
Seafood at a buffet place has always been a no no in my book .
Some steaming trays were left empty , they did not refill food .
You will not be disappointing .
25.00 for a two minutes wash , definitely felt taken for the lack of effort ... the wash was worth about 5.00 ... do not waste your money on it ...
The name did not spark confidence and we feared the worst from looking up yelp reviews but overall was not too terrible .
Both glasses arrived with no head .
He also ordered risotto which i did taste ... it was rubbish do not waste your money .
Overall , i was fed but i do not see us returning .
& i still could not finish my 1 / 2 .
My hubs is a glutton for punishment out of his love for it 's flavor & orderted the burrito again at food truck friday & could not demolish it alone & he 's not a pansy .
Final verdict : not going back .
A co-worker and i were not in the mood for subway , mcdonald 's , or einstein 's , so we decided to try chico 's tacos - a place i 'd driven by many times but had not tried before .
The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells , but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried .
I will not be back , especially when there 's a filibertos just down the road .
One thing i do not like about dark places , unless it is at night in a romantic restaurant , is that it is difficult to see your food properly , especially if you would like to be able to see it if it is cooked properly , or if the kitchen crew may have personally customized your food without your knowledge .
I had originally ordered the smoked meat poutine , but no smoked meat was available .
The fries and gravy was not hot though , so my cheese curds did not even warm through , let alone melt .
Other than the non-melted curds , the maple was too strong in sweetness , the salty gravy could not even properly balance the two out into a savoury / sweet dish .
She even did not care about the patrons behind us to take their orders either .
The poutine did come out quickly though ( probably because the food was not cooked to order ) .
Mostly likely will not be back .
These employees were kind , and did not seem bothered at all that we were there .
Not to mention the healthy serving of veggies chopped up in big chunks and spread around the chicken .
The pork friend rice however was not my favorite .
I will not be ordering that again .
Not exactly professional or appetizing .
I might not dine in again though as the experience turned out to be a little confusing .
They also carry turner 's tea , and you really can not eat a triangle hoagie without having turner 's to wash it down with .
Plus during lent they might run out of fish , and you do not want to be without that delicious crispy fish .
No matter what , it 's worth the wait !
Prices are not cheap but the atmosphere is always friendly and lively and the wing options are great .
Little dumpling ought to invest in a louder vent or something to block out noises that are not conducive to the customer enjoying their meal .
I have no urgency to return .
Let 's face it , if you can not at least make a classic poutine well then there 's no point trying to make it fancier .
I would not even bother mentioning the cheese if the gravy was better .
Here 's the scoop : + friendly front desk staff + super huge corner suite ( separate living room area with small kitchenette and dishwasher ! ) + good smellin ' bathroom soaps + super comfy bed + plentiful parking + beautiful + close to major freeway + tasty breakfast ( free ! ) not that cheap continental stuff either .
It could be that one of their wings they served me was undercooked , but i will never know .
All in all cool spot if your looking to kick back and enjoy some drinks with no cover charge .
The bellagio 's hotel lounge does not disappoint .
At most italian restaurants , i just order pasta , because the meat does not really interest me that much , i love my carbs , and especially because usually the pasta is more than enough to fill me up - especially if i want any appetizers or desserts .
We squeezed the lemon slice it came with over it but i kind of wish we did not because the coating on the calamari was the kind that wilts as soon as it hits liquid .
The rapini linguini was beautifully garlicky and olive oily , and the tomatoes in it were magically not acidic .
I need to re-emphasize how rich and almost heavy the pastas are - the portions are smaller , which is perfect , but if anyone 's squeamish about seeing a puddle of oil at the bottom of their plate , this pasta is not for them !
The meats were good but not as impressive as the pastas .
We saved the flourless chocolate cake for home because we did not want to skip it but were too full to have it right away .
After the hand wash there were still so many spots left uncleaned , the drying aspect was not complete either as i could clearly see all the water spots and dirt still on my car .
Lol i will not come here again if my life depended on it .
Went with a group of three , and the others could not even eat a plate .
Would not recommend .
Did not care for the traditional poutine .
Not enough cheese , too much gravy .
I agree that chico 's is not exactly high end ; however , if you are craving quick , simple mexican flare that is not from a scary drive - thru and will not break the bank then this place is it .
It 's made with crisp , fresh , bright green romaine lettuce ( no iceberg ! ) , black beans , a small scoop of their spanish rice and the tastiest grilled , shaved , spicy chicken breast ( no scary bits ) .
It 's made with crisp , fresh , bright green romaine lettuce ( no iceberg ! ) , black beans , a small scoop of their spanish rice and the tastiest grilled , shaved , spicy chicken breast ( no scary bits ) .
You will not be sorry .
Stick with the salad and bean burrito , you will not be sorry .
This place is close and convenient , though it is not always quick .
The lemon chicken is basically chicken katsu with a side of bright - yellow " lemon " sauce for dipping ... not too appealing .
Daiya does not cost that much .
They do not nickle and dime you here .
Had to give a licence and credit card to get a pool table ( understandable ) but did not see a server for roughly 10 minutes .
Did not think about ordering food seeing as the drink orders had taken waaaaayyyy too long .
Would not go back !
I also do not understand the bad reviews !
No complaints ever about the orange chicken , fried rice , or kung pao chicken .
All the veggies are cooked through yet never mushy .
The food did not have much flavor , it was definitely left out for a few hours ..... would not recommend at all .... save your money folks

When you arrive at 12:30 pm and the buffet ends at 1 pm , you do not expect much .
I usually do not venture out too much while travelling on business alone and opt for room service .
A real old school kind of barman that you really do not find much anymore , anywhere !
Music is pretty good , and the dj is not against taking requests .
If you have an hour to kill and do not feel like paying 20 bucks to get into one of vegas ' crazy nightclubs have a drink here .
Not a ton of flavor .
All in all ok for a " i do not wan na cook " kind of night .
First off , i am not a fan of peas in particular ... but that day i decoded to try things for a change and also ordered the asparagus as a side .
( never tried asparagus in my entire life ! ) as the order came , it all smelt simply delicious and the flavour unimaginable as compared to anything i have ever tasted .
Can not wait to come back .
Even the tortilla was not cooked all the way .
It was horrible and i will not ever be back .
Coffee was also good - no cream however .
As for the food , i doubt there s much , if anything that is not good to order .
I have tried a range of their food from the lounge fries , cheese steaks , burgers , fish sandwiches , and wraps , and have never been disappointed .
Now i am not a huge salad fan because i love sinking my teeth into some type of meat , my mother and sister always enjoy them and rarely order anything else .
I tried pork sandwich with kimchi fries , honestly nothing special do not know why the ratings are so high .
Do not believe the hype .
I had heard good things and the experience did not disappoint .
The chips were not the best and i think flatbread or pita would go better with the dip , but i still really enjoyed it .
It was an above average burger , but did not live up to the " best in the burgh " claim on their website and menu .
The meat blends just did not seem to be a great combination , too lean a ratio possibly .
I usually bring my mini video cam whenever i go out and could not even use it in here .
4 . not enough bartenders ..
Although the one guy was fast , it was not good enough to get to everyone on time .
And he gave me the price and never collected my money to give me my change back , so instead of waiting forever , i just left him the money with a tip larger than i wanted to give him .
Listen up guy , not everyone will be as honest as me and leave you your mula !
They do not hold up the line to make it look more busy .
2 . no cover !! yes !!
A " nice " bar/ lounge ( i am not including dive bars ) in las vegas that 's free to get into ??
It was not typical of any club music you heard .
It 's the same dough , but the thin does not overwhelm the flavor profile like the thicker hand tossed does .
I would recommend trying it out , but i would not say it fully satisfies my craving for a good traditional montreal poutine .
Not that i have anything against franchises , it 's just nice to have some variety and competition .
It 's a chinese buffet so please do not expect elegant steakhouse quality food .
You can not beat the price and they have sushi and hibachi as well .
The seafood never looks all that appetizing , but i usually stick to chicken anyways .
The booths are not the most comfortable , but so what .
Our server ( unfortunately we can not remember the name ! ) was one of the best .
Do not go here !!
Not only did they not clean out the trash or get the dirt off the door but they left my car running with the drivers door wide open after they were done .
We will never go here again !!
I do not go to pittsburgh that often , but when i do there is always a stop at the npl. this place has an extensive menu ( including lounge fries ) , access to every game through one of it 's plethora of tvs , a decent sized bar , and a wheel of prizes that you get to spin on your birthday .
Not many other options in the area and you can tell .
Went today and got an over - fried breaded piece of thin fish on an oversized not - fresh bun .
Draft beer was not very cold .
Will likely not be returning to npl for a long time .
For takeout , i 'd put them in my top 5 . my sandwich was hot and fairly neat in the takeout container , everything that was supposed to be crisp was , and i was not disappointed .
Our glasses were never empty ; they were always filled by our wonderful waitress and busboy whom , were very nice !
Still good , not great , but good .
Found this place here on yelp , and could not be happier !
No written orders were kept in front of the cooks , it was all by memory .
The manager made things right but still this place is not okay !
If you are looking for something fast and not special it is the place to go !
The staff is not the greatest ( not very friendly ) .
I would be more inclined to go when there is a game on all the tvs , and for drinks not food .
The atmosphere was not that of the french laundry or joel rubochon in paris , but it truly felt like home .
Somewhere you are not afraid to have an extra glass of wine , eat your entire basket of bread or order more than one pasta .
Going back recently was an amazing experience because i no longer have to wait in line for hours to eat her delicious food .
Mama will not be an individual who will in a james beard award , but instead she focuses on food that seems almost philanthropic in a way .
I ordered the dill and sweet thai wings and although the sauce was not bad , the wings were small and not cooked very well , the chicken was too slimy , no crispness .
Do not think i am coming back to this place for wings , but my friends burger looked pretty good .
This is a nice little place in the bellagio -- which i would not have stopped in had i not gotten a 2 for 1 drink coupon from a pretty girl out front of the casino .
It 's quite dark in here -- to where you almost can not see the menu .
One thing that struck me was the attitude from the waitress when we ordered a shot of patron and a glass of water ... to which she responded " um , we do not serve tap water . ' fine and dandy , until we get the half pint bottle of fiji that cost $ 5 .
In a bottle , even , with no glass offered .
Be forwarned ... sometimes a two for one drink coupon does not mean you will come out ahead !
We went on a sunday night 1-15-2012 for my wifes birthday and i will not likely go back .
I had been there twice for lunch and it was not bad , however my experience last night was horrible .
Most everything i tasted was bland and no egg foo young .
What chinese food buffet does not have that item as a staple food on their menu .
As i said before , the food was mostly pretty bland and even the hot and spicy dishes were not very spicy at all .
Too top it off , not looking at the prices before i sat down , two meals and one ice tea , $ 28.08 which was ridiculous for the quality of food we ate .
Taco bell or subway would have been a much better choice , or lin 's which has never been disappointing .
Never again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I recommend any wings flavour you can not get elsewhere and if you stick to basic and familiar flavours then you are wasting your foodie experience .
Take out experience this was not only a very awkward experience but also annoying !
This is definitely not an establishment primed for dining in , and if you must try for yourself , i would strongly recommend to download their menu and call ahead .
Not a word to the little girl !!!
I would love to say the food was fantastic and it was well worth it but unfortunately the wor won ton soup was extremely salty and consisted of 4 wontons , 2 shrimp , 2 snap peas , a few slices of pork and no veggies !!!
The veggie egg rolls were not cooked internally and our rice container was maybe 3 / 4 full ...
So not only was the food sub par , next to awful ... but the customer service is non-existent and you become an instant babysitter for the establishment without any reward .
I was in arizona for 2 days and ate there pizza for 2 days lol i could not resist ...
Never going back .
The first time i went to caramel was this past trip to vegas last week , and i do not know what took me so long to go !
I did not have any food , but the menu selection looks very good .
Food , grease , and smudges of " i do not know what " were all over both of them .
We ordered decaf and had to wait for it to brew ( not really a big deal , but you pay $ 2.20 per cup , then get to enjoy it for half of your meal ) .
No hash - browns .
I ordered hash - browns , not grits .
The waitress was very nice , but i do not think she had been properly trained .
I do not spend a lot of time in this area but i have been working nearby for about half a month now and this has quickly become a morning staple .
I do not think i have ever given one star to a place i have never stayed at before .
We were a little disappointed not to be going home that night but were at least happy they put us up in a nice hotel ... .... or so we thought .
We saw other hotel shuttles come by twice and still no embassy suites , so i called to find out where the were .
We finally got to embassy suites and were not greeted by anyone .
There were two employees standing at the front casually chatting with each other and not bothering to acknowledge our presence .
I clarified with her that they had rooms available , just not one that the airline had paid for .
When she came back , she instructed me that she called the hotel down the street and they had vacancy , and that we would need to stay at the ramada inn down the street instead ( see separate review . ) we had to ask for a ride from the shuttle driver there and luckily he had not left for the airport yet .
Went for the first time today and it will not be the last time .
So when we walk to the booth we want to sit the lady does not set our silverware down she drops it down , i almost wanted to leave at that point but we were both hungry and did not want to find somewhere else to eat .
The staff here have never been to friendly .
I came here to get a hand car wash on my brand new truck and for $ 35 it was not good .
I will not return and do not recommend coming here at all .
Disappointed that it was not good either .
The food is not great quality , but when you can catch it right when it comes out from the kitchen it is fairly good .
We did not feel like waiting for our boyfriends to get into the bank nor did they want to pay the cover , so we decided to go to caramel .
Not very crowded for a saturday night after 11 .
No line or cover .
Not too bad , there were 5 of us and with 3 of the coupons , drinks came out to about $ 50 not including tip .
( not my cup o' tea ! )
I did not care for the music , but my friends and i were pretty buss and dancing anyway .
Not sure why we did not sit down but we just hung out by the bar all night .
I am not one to hang out on the strip but once in a great while , i will venture out there for good reason .
If you want great honest home style italian food you will do no better than seven numbers .
Everything rosa does is done with love and the key to success is the simplicity . calamari is light crisp and the best you will eat , the sexy duck is like a happy duck who just can not wait to be eaten .
Let momma rosa and the fantastic staff at seven numbers take care of you for a night you will not forget .
A few negatives .... do not put my order on a dirty tray .... 2:13 pm 12 dirty tables ... hire more people or train staff to clean tables in between customers ... lastly please do not reach on the inside of the cup with your fingers .... common sense food handling skills ... hope the mgr takes note and makes changes ... this will not prevent me from coming back but will note changes .

Pricing is also not bad ; dinner for 2 with a can of pop is around $ 25 .
My nails have never looked better !
By the looks of it i thought it would be a fast food style mexican restaurant similar to el pollo loco or something like that so my expectations were not high .
Now i can not stop thinking about fish tacos .
On top of that , the chicken did not taste so good .
The only thing that is still the same is the front staff taking the order but what good is that if the food is not anymore .
I have lived in vegas my whole life and never found a shop that compares to this md nails u rock
I will not be going back .
I took it to a mechanic who said there was no gasketing .
At first he thought maybe the bolt was not tightened enough , said that can happen .
Not the case though .
So i decided no more oil changes from there .
The back seats and hatch back were never vaccummed , or if they were , not very thoroughly .
The passenger rearview mirror was moved ( normally they did not do that ) .
I take it to a car wash so that i do not have that problem , because i do if i do it myself .
Not this time .
I did not want to drive all the way back there as i was heading northwest for the rest of my errands that day .
While true that their pricing may be slightly higher than other businesses in the area , they did not seem unreasonable considering the ingredients are sourced locally ( including bread from local artisal bakeries ) .
No matter the quality of the food or reputation of the establishment customer service have to be better than everything else .
Very tasty breakfast sandwich and cappuccino , but at $ 12 total and a small portion with only two bits of melon on the side , i will not be coming here often -- which is unfortunate because the vibe and ingredients are great and there is nowhere else in the area that does a sit down breakfast aside from the dingy joint across the street .
This area should be affordable for young families , not straight into full tourist - price gentrification .
The restaurant do not take reservations for parties under 6 so we were lucky to get a table since the place is not too big .
I do not care how busy anything else is , i do not see myself coming back .
20 minutes later we had our table ( no complaints ) the food was excellent as always , unfortuantly they decided to change one of the flavors on my favorite wings , which resulted in the wings not being hot enough .
No this is not a michelin star restaurant , it 's an all night diner .
I hesitate to post this review for fear the deals will not continue for my next journey here .
Sorry , i could not hear you over the jacuzzi bubbles 8 )
Then take out orders are never ready as planned .
They definitely did not disappoint .
A fantastic way to feed a lot of people , and i can not wait to return !
Wackys loses a star for me solely because out of the 5 - 6 times i have been there service has been so - so and never consistent .
I did not really like the taste , it was not very hot & the consistency was strange .
The guy that cooks ( i am pretty sure he 's the only guy there and is there every time ) is always on point with everything and is a great multitasker from what i saw so no wonder my food is always fast .
The one word of wisdom i have is , do not order lounge fries to go .
The bone marrow flat bread was very different but in a good way i can not quite describe .
Literally my only disappointment was that the salmon belly crudo was not on the menu at the moment ( i really wanted to try it ha )
Called back and got their " full " voice mail finally got through and when i said the order was not complete the call dropped twice .
I have been saying for a few years now , that this corner just needs a ' starbucks ' to turn it around and clean it up a little ... do not get me wrong , i love little indian , but the venues on this corner usually leave much to be desired .
I stopped by this morning and had a mocha and toast with my two fav spreads ( 'pb&n ' as i like to call it - peanut butter & nutella ) and it did not disappoint .
Reading her fb page , you get a sense of how much personal passion has been put into this biz , and being there in person proves that 's not just a bunch of publicity .
I do not really know what it was called , but i call it a beast because it is huge .
Atmosphere was not for me , definetly a neighborhood hang out .
If u do not care about dust , no reception area and top dollar then stay here .
Do not go during a big sports game .
They told us they had no menus left , we had to write our orders and bring it to the front .
Waited for an hour , no waitress has come by .
No food , no drinks .
We do not have one in california and i have not had any in years .
My only experience with this place will be a one and done kind of story , so i can not speak to what other yelpers are speaking of with the service and cleanliness .
Waffle house , i can not give you five stars for awesomeness , but you deserve at least a couple stars for being open 24 hours and feeding a hungry girl with a late night craving of waffles and eggs .
Do not expect haute cuisine .... but you will be happy with the cheap eats and friendly service .
The wait staff are jackasses , but at least you do not need to deal with them too much .
I just was not that into the complimentary baked puffs of dough that served as a bread product and resembled yorkshire pudding .
If it was 6 oz. , my filet was a large 6 . sides were no less inviting : a magnificent truffle mac n cheese graced by demi glace , a large array of assorted varieties of sauteed mushrooms , and a large baked potato adorned with butter , chives , and bacon .
But a meal of this magnitude would not be complete without a memorable dessert !
This was my first time eating breakfast here and it was not all that .
Or , better yet , cooked my own breakfast at home but i was " paying it forward " by treating someone who needed a " real " meal and not mcdonald 's dollar menu .
What 's not to love ?
Mind you , the poutine is delicious , but if you just look into the box ..... just not attractive nor appetizing at all .
No doubt .
Not too thick , not too watery .
Their sampler platters are not in big portions so skip on those .
It 's no pf chang but it not the worst i have had .
The second time we did not even bother .
They would be much better off to just lower the price of the room and not even offer the breakfast .
I was expecting a wait since it 's new years day but i never expect or appreciate the attitude .
I did not make you get this job or come in today ma'am .
Have been a few times and never had a problem , staff are always great !
The place was nice in appearance waiter taking drinks was very rude and was never attended to order food i just walked out this was last night i was going to have dinner with a friend from new york i felt like everyone else in the room was being attended exept me waited like 30 min no waiter or waitress even went to take my order i do not recommend this place there 's better places else where in vegas
No cover , no crazy lines , no wall to wall crowds .
This place could be packed over the weekend and do not open late .
The service is good and the price is not too high .
I must have been expecting alot out of the flavors for the food here but it did not really hit the spot .
For some reason , i could not get the most out of the flavor from the pork belly .
Maybe i was not that hungry as it was already around 9 pm so maybe that 's why my tastebuds could not enjoy my order .
Exceptional ... no other way to say it .
My only regret is not writing this review immediately ; i wish i could name the individuals who served us .
Waitress did not know my table was hers , but apologized and gave me coffee on the house .
I ordered my food mildly spicy and the restaurant provides choice for not spicy , mild , medium and hot .
I am not a big spicy food eater , so the mild spicy was just the right amount for me .
Some other items my friends ordered include ( in no particular order ) kimchi fries , tofu fries , vegetable bao and fish bao .
Never equal drums to wing pieces .
Sorry can not order here anymore .
Very disappointing based on other baskets i have seen come out .. wings simple , guess not .
I do not know why i keep going here .
I was sitting at a table with 11 other people , and we did not get enough food .
Honestly , i do not know what kind of cows they get , but these burgers are not to be trifled with .
Give it a try , you will not be sorry .
I will definitely not be coming back to china city .
2 . steak kabobs were not only tough as shoe leather , but cold .
Not " cold " as in intentionally chilled beef ... but cold as in " our warmer is broken and this kabob was ( over ) cooked four hours ago and has been sitting out since then " .
3 . most food either was not labeled or was mis-labeled .
6 . food not well - stocked .
Polish sausage was crisp on the outside , juicy on the inside and served at proper temperature ; and the little fried dough , sugary dessert things ... like little doughnuts .. those were amazingly warm and light and not as greasy as some people make them .
If you are in the area and in dire need of chinese buffet , go to lin 's at 75th ave and mcdowell ... i have stopped going there since they have not been taking care of the place ( bathrooms all destroyed and graffiti'd ... food quality is not as good as it once was ) ... but i would choose lin 's every time over china city .
However they were a little on the pricey side but good was delish , the crab legs however were not coming out fast enough people were standing around the buffet food waiting to get the crab legs .
I would go back just when it 's not as crowded .
There was no acknowledgement , rather the other customers leaving at the same time recieved warm goodbyes .
Maybe because we are teenagers , but i did not feel good for being treated differently for the way i look , or i am just exaggerating ?
The room has just the right colors and lighting to have you feeling fine .. and last but not least , there 's a ridiculous amount of craft beer to choose from .
If the sprawling beer list is overwhelming do not worry , the tender has got you .
Grab your favorite beer or one you have never heard of , and challenge your friends to trivial pursuit - or hungry hippos .
( it s more fun than facebook ) this is a can not miss place for beer drinkers born before 1980 .
It 's been fun watching this place grow and become successful , and it is not by luck .
I am not a night owl , but this place is open pretty late ( 11 pm ) .
They truly do care about your experience here and not just making money .
Did i mention that they call in staff when they do not want customers to be waiting a long time ?
To state the obvious , i am not very happy about it !
I will never let them touch my interior ever again .
Just i thought the server was not that good in terms of understanding our order .
I did not eat all of the bread , but i ate all of the fish and pups .
I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever ( a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water ) ... when i complained .. of course no one spoke english .
The salad was very fresh and even the ranch was legit - not the stuff you get at the store , but the richer , home made stuff .
5 . pizza arrived very hot , salad was perfect temp ( not frozen ) .
During all you can eat , she will not come after the first order .
I noticed this and complained and the waitress was stubborn and did not want to take it back .
She obviously ended up getting no tip .
If you go there go for the atmosphere and do not bother bringing extra cash forol the tip , the service is brutal and they do not deserve anything .
The weitress spent about half an hour trying to convince us not to get it ( likely since she needs to do more work ) .
After everyone had one , they were fine , the wings were not as hot as they all made them seem .
We were told the tables were also reserved for 11:30 pm that night so we could not sit there unless we order bottled service and then would have to leave by 11:30 .
All of a sudden , the server came up and said in a snarky voice " you can not sit there " .
You better know what to order because if you are unsure and can not order immediately , the server will get upset and stick their nose up at you ( with a little phhhh ) no joke .
Glad they did not let us get the bottle service even though we were going to when we first arrived ( at approx $ 400 / bottle no less ) .
P.p.s. i would have rated 0 stars , but it was not possible .
Not any more .
We will not be back .
Not tasty .
Ranch dip taste too sour like rotten , fried dumpling meat taste like mixed meat , most dishes taste bland or does not seem like food ..
Nothing else to say just not worth it to spend money for
No uppity bs here .
We carried out pizza from here on my visit to arizona , so i can not speak to dining in the restaurant .
The toppings were fairly fresh , not canned like a lot of places .
I will not be back here again .
I came to check in after driving 7 hours , and they said they could not process the card on file and did not have an authorization form .
I am shocked he would be placed in a management role as he had absolutely no managerial skills at all .
If you have a problem , say a prayer that markus is not the one working .
I was not really fond of catfish until i tried jamburrito's way of serving it .
I had a veggie poutine from this place , did not hate it , did not love it .
This food was not good .
Just not good .
It had a weird sour taste to it , not that it had gone bad , just not good food .
We will not be returning .
It is not fabulous , but we are always satisfied .
Not happy at all .
Not this time .
It actually was not crazy spicy as i 'd anticipated , which made it even more enjoyable .
No lie , they were generous with the catfish and the jambalaya had some awesome sausage too .
I was definitely in pain due to fullness even though i shared it with eric , but i just could not stop eating it !
Can not wait to try other items on the menu but it will be hard not getting the catfish burrito again !
I do not care what anyone else says i love this place !
They are very generous with their portions , they load up on the curd cheese ( which is vital ) and do not cheap out on the gravy , or whatever sauce is on your poutine .
The place is small but there 's loads to do along 17th so why not just take it to go ?
We were not rushed through our meal we had time between courses to drink and talk .
The mains - thank god we had room because they were no complaints .
Have not been here for a few years .
Hotel food , from omaha steakhouse , was heavy and outdated for my taste and there were not other options within walking distance .
I was not a guest of this hotel , i was here to assist my sister in decorating the hotel room for a bachelorette party .
The agent was very friendly , but it left me wondering why there would only be one person at the desk or why there was not a call center where the calls could be routed .
This is the reason why i would never pay to stay here .
I would not take my chances there .
The coffee is smooth , bold and not burnt .
We were surprised when we asked the waitress ( who was super nice ) what was good , she said , " not the waffles . "
It was not that great , but it was not expensive at all , so we got what we paid for .
When i call in to place an order i never have to wait on hold , they take my order quickly and are always polite and helpful .
I am surprised that i have not reviewed this place before as i have been here at least 8 times in the last two years .
That being said , some of the touchscreen elements on the wheel of fortune machine were not working and my son says he lost out on 50 tickets because the " l " was not working when he pressed on it .
This is the first time in my life that i have been in a wing place and not had wings .
I will be back , but not on my own volition .
No reservation , we got a table around 7 pm and the place soon filled .
Hostesses were rude and lacked any welcoming presence , they seated a larger party that came in after us with no real excuse .
Manager took the chicken parm off the bill but offered no real apology or explaination .
Will not be back anytime soon .
My only slight complaint is that there is not a lit - up sign outside the bar .
Not as good as everyone says it is .
I would not be so harsh but folks , let 's wake up as a whole and demand no msg , it 's a simple enough thing and i suppose we should not support places that use it .
Do n't smother your choice in the parmesan cheese at the table either - parmesan cheese is 1 % straight msg by weight .
But that 's no reason to turn a blind eye , keep consuming , and " hope " everything will be ok .
Should be fine to eat here as long as the request " no msg " is made .
Can not be replicated since only their hands know the consistency , their nose the correct aroma etc .
The fries were not bad : not great but not terrible like i have heard in the past .
However , i could not stomach the peppercorn sauce - not sure what about it but i am all about the traditional gravy , apparently .
So , while my first visit was not amazing , i will be back to try again as it 's not totally their fault that my choice was bad .
This was really the best dinner we have had in a long time we had decided to try something new and we were not story the fish of the day was cooked to perfection and you know it mouthwatering sauce the environment was like a real italian place
One member of our group complained about too much " italian seasoning " taste , but the rest of us yelled him down - can not please everyone .
This place sucks they went though all my stuff after i asked them not to they broke a peace to my rear mirror and did not say anything till i asked about it and did not want to fix it they did not vacuum and spilled some cleaner that stained my carpet i had to leave to get my son from school i called all day trying to speak to a manager the girl that picked up the phone was nice about it after the 4th time calling she took my info and said the manager will call me as soon as he can well he never did so i called back they where really unprofessional about everything i will never go back
I know i said i would not come here again because of what happened last time , lol .. but i did !
Actually i came here twice in the past before without reviewing and no sign of that rude waitress what so ever !!
I am assuming she got fired , i would not doubt it .
I enjoyed it , my friend did not care for them but i did and i recommend them .
The food is always fresh and never appears or tastes as not .
The fruit and desert is always fresh and never " funky " .
The reason i will not give 5 stars is due to the attitude of a couple of attendants .
My only complaint was that some of the wait - staff did not pay attention when i gave my order and i sometimes had to ask for my check .
Lots of rare brews at a good price also so yeah check this place out if you have not been
Never at the end of lunch or dinner .
I have not been treated this rudely in a long time .
I used to dig wh ... but this last time we we nt sunday in phoenix - just was not impressed .
It was still not what i wanted but i ate a couple bites in the middle .
My sausage was just sitting there waiting for pick up so they were not even hot .
Argh. my guests eggs were cold , cheese was not even melted in the grits so he did not even eat his bfast & we had a 5 hour drive not happy .
Come on guys let 's get it together do not slack .
Now there are slackers ( i heard the younger kid / cook telling one girl all of her errors while calling out orders and she use said " whatever same thing " no you did not say pull two sausage .
There is not a wh on the west coast / cali or vegas so when i do find one i want it to be great !
Stoned and hung - over staff do not care what they are serving you .
I paid $ 10 for a soupy watery poutine that was not edible .
Not appetizing at all and wasted my money .
Should not this be a housekeeping checklist item ???
It is no wonder this is the cheapest hilton property in charlotte .
Food was very good for the most part , the pasta dishes were a bit bland , but nothing some of their hot chili oil can not fix .
They had transformed the gone - but - not - lamented bistro burger by partitioning off most of it ( soon to be an italian joint ) , and creating a very intimate , relaxing space .
A nice preparation , but it helps if you like foie gras , which i have decided i do not .
( no fault of theirs ) .
A couple of us got the american wagyu rib cap ( divine ) and , since we wanted a bite , forced my poor brother - in - law to order the japanese wagyu at almost $ 90 for a small steak and nothin ' else - not even a sprig of parsley .
I tried to encourage babygirl to get one when we returned together , but she loves her filet , so she ordered from the lowly left column ( prime grade - $ 65 for a 12 oz portion ) , and announced that not only was a knife unnecessary , she barely needed a fork .
Most beloved side dishes included the wasabi mashed potatoes ( they come in a trio of flavors , you will just have to man up and eat 'em all ) , asparagus with burrata and balsamic , cauliflower gratin , baked in i - do not - know - what sauce but it was creamy and cheesy and delicious , and the mushrooms , cooked in wine and topped with what must have been goat cheese because it was too good to have been anything else .
The best is the peanut butter kind - it will put hearts in your cheeks like you have never had .
Well , i wish i could give them 4 1 / 2 , and maybe i should have rounded up , but , the lobster bisque was disappointing - very thin and watery and not very flavorful .
The " roasted " vegetables were cut into very small chunks , but did not show evidence of having gone anywhere near an oven .
They were not " al dente " , they were practically raw .
But there should not be any land mines .
Very annoying after i said , no two times .
Never having any reason to go to swissvale though , it took me this long to make it .
It should not take 30 minutes to make food for 10 people , although they were getting call in orders as well .
Not very impressive .
Seriously , do not skip this .
The cake was not too heavy and the crust was not too crispy .
The sauce was not too sweet and had a nice tart .
The modern décor , comfortable atmosphere , attentive staff , and amazing food , you will not be disappointed .
We can not wait to return during our next visit in vegas .
Not recommended .
The place looks big and nice but no attendant ever greeted me .
I got the worst $ 16.99 car wash ever i had to go around and vacuum my own damn car please do not waste your money my niece and nephew could have done a better job in my garage .
I was looked at like i was crazy and the manager said they do not do that because i 'd be leaving with their product uncooked .
I have been to many pizzerias in az , and never encountered this before .
The only difference is they have a wide range of toppings such as aaa beef , chicken , pork and a few more ordinary mix - ups that you would not normally add to your fries .
I brought the poutine up to the counter and saw the look on her face , she was probably hoping that i would not complain .
The place is small and cozy so it 's perfect for a small snack on a cold day , not so much a hot day because it was rather warm so i could not imagine how stuffy it would be on a hot day .
This shack would definitely curb your enthusiasm if you are a poutine lover , not so much for me .
The employees do not set the rules but have to live with them .
It s 2014 and they still do not take credit and or debit cards .
I know my van is a big pain in the ass , especially since i have 4 kids in the back usually ... but come on man , you did not ' even try ... well maybe you tried a little bit when i pay you money to do a job , i want you to try a lot ... like try hard .
The van was mostly clean , but i was still scratching spots of shit off from the outside and was disappointed to see things like back seat cup holders totally ignored ... not worth my time to drive back over and complain about cup holders and nit-pick about birdshit leftovers on my hood ... just not really going to go back , ever.
Did not disappoint .
I can not even find words for how awful the cauliflower was .
It was certainly not fried .
I would not serve this to a senior in a hospital .
Toronto needs to learn a few lessons in good cuisine - do not know how joanne kates can think that this is even palatable food - it was gross and this morning i even feel ill from all that grease .
North park lounge is always a go to when you can not think of anything else , but it 's always pretty decent .
Ok ok , i have to say the best taco 's i am sorry but i can eat this all day no joke add a coke to that please ;]
This joint may not look like much but the food is tasty .
Some of the tastiest italian food in the city ( pastas can not be rivaled by any other restaurant in the area ) great food - good , but not superb staff , although their personalities make up for the potential tardiness on busy nights .
I would gladly give this place another star , but i just can not bring myself .
I usually never drink the sweet cocktails , a simple martini is all i need , but it was my hubby 's first time here , so we decided to try what they had to offer .
I can not remember the name , but it had caramel in it and it was fantastic .
However , after a few drinks , frank ordered a beer , guinness to be exact , and since they did not serve it on tap , he settled for a bottle .
They placed ranch out for the queso and i covered my entire nachos thinking it was queso ... and it was not it was ranch .
There were no veggies in sight .. who puts ranch out with nachos ?!
Please tell me this is not the america we live in ... bring out real queso or do not put out nachos .
Though not pretentious , as the staff here is so warm and welcoming .
Since they serve food from 5 to 9 , there is no smoking during these hours ( newish vegas law ) .
The quality of food was not what was expected from a food truck it easily could have been served in a four star restaurant .
There 's not a waffle house in our area .
If i can editorilize a little bit here , this is soft butter , not the hard butter pellets that have been sitting in the freezer .
You should never have to melt your own butter .
Is not that what waffle house is all about ?
Wife and i waited 10 mins at the end of the bar , a small crowd of about 10 at the other end but we were never even acknowledged by either the guy or the girl behind the bar .
This place is a very interesting spot that can be easily missed if your not paying attention .
Hood came out dirty and they did not even try on the rims .
I do nt remember the name of the product but it was not d&d or opi , i had never heard of it .
I am happy i did not listen to some of the reviews ....
If you like mediocre this is not the place for you .
Let 's start by talking about what i did not have .... carnitas , lengua , cabeza , al pastor .
.... they do not offer any if those !
This is phoenix and you do not offer anything except those 3 for tacos or burritos ?
As for what i did have , the carne asada burrito was not very good .
Do not waste your time here .
If you are hungover , this is not the place for you but if you have friends with kids and they want to join you for brunch , this is the place .
After years of improvements , i now have no issue going in an ordering a battleship on my own .
It 's not the most attractive dining place in pittsburgh , mostly take out , and we have never sat in , always take out .
The super battleship which we have only had once , the battleship is our favorite , the destroyer which we have not tried yet , and my new personal favorite the torpedo .
Sadly , no one we know is there any longer , but ..
After 30 + years we have not tried the cheesesteak , i am looking forward to trying one .
The cafe was full , as we were there right around 12:30 , but we were not able to stay anyways , as the bebe was fussing .
Seemed like a cute place , but will not make a special trip out .
The food was not good .
It was not bad .
He felt the sauce on the pasta did not taste homemade but loved the actual eggplant and meatballs .
Not a bad option for north hills
I came here cause the line at matt 's big breakfast was too long and i was not disappointed by jamburritos !
The hot and sour soup was not only lacking in flavor but also smelt like a dirty foot just walking out of the gym .
The kimchi is not worth coming back to this place ... nothing is worth coming here ...
Will never order coffee there again .
I have been coming here for a few months now and i have never had a bad experience ...
Yuck - this the first time i have ever left a review , and with the food and service combined i am compelled to let others no , do not come here food review - yuck .... how about no stars .
Yuck - this the first time i have ever left a review , and with the food and service combined i am compelled to let others no , do not come here food review - yuck .... how about no stars .
The waitress even asked us as she was taking away all our plates full of food why we did not like it .
Did not offer to discount it out not charge is or anything , just apologized as she handed us the check .
Almost knocked my six year old daughter over because they did not stop to let her by .
I 'd say that 's my favorite , but my kids do not like all that extra jazz , so for them , i just order the pepperoni .
Do yourself a favor and not cook .
It was an art show , i did not know the artist , but i was invited by a couple of friends .
Then i had a cucumber essence which contains cucumber of course , and i can not remember the other ingredients , but there were two slices of cucumber in the glass .
Then my friend had a carameltini , which was green and i thought that was my cucumber drink , but no it was not .
The service was slow but the food was fresh although not very flavorful .
Do not expect an upscale trendy kind of place .
60 beers on tap every kind of drink special you could imagine and happy hour every day from 1 pm to 8 pm. fantastic place to go and not spend half your month salary .
Years ago , when i tried a chicken dish , i really did not like the chicken ( although my friends did ) .
It is not the most amazing pad thai i have ever had in my life , but whenever i get a craving for it , this is where i go ( always take - out ) .
Reliable , not absurdly priced , and friendly owners .
We never watch a game or have a party without a battleship hoagie !!!!
Please do not overcook your fries !
Atmosphere was fantastic ; cozy & comforting , eclectic but not overly so furniture and decor . workable for a romantic date , or a more casual dinner - with - friends , with dripping candles in wine bottles , sitting on crate paper and burlap tablecloths .
Did not drink anything or eat anything , so i can not say anything about the food & drinks , but the service was horrible .
What 's not to like about this place ?
Came to this location after not eating at any of their locations for a while .
The place does get busy since there are not a lot of other good lunch takeout options north of eglinton .
You can not fool , me with your overpriced poutine .
The sauce is like brown water and the cheese curds have no flavor either .
Not what i expected for a hilton property .
Again , i was hoping this was no big deal .
Once again , i was not welcomed as a hilton honors member .
No big deal .
Because i am on the second floor , i 'd prefer to take the stairs to not waste people 's time wanting to get to a higher floor .
I can not even accuately translate into words how sad i truely felt inside the bar .
I even gave away my two free drink tickets because no amount of alcohol was worth staying in that depressing place .
So i went into waffle house to get my sweet tea fix - since i live in arizona good sweet tea like thy make in the south is hard to come by ... if you are looking for genuine southern nitty gritty greasy good ol ' fashion food - search no longer !
Sure the place inside my smell and may not look the cleanest but hey then again all the best places have something wrong with them haha the price is just right !
Short of those circumstances , i would not recommend it to anybody .
Suddenly ordering single drinks - and god forbid 1 bottle of water - was not enough to compete for the waitresses attention .
The drinks are not cheap , which is fine and what you would expect , given the location .
But you 'd also expect the service to be a lot better - and to not have to get up and track your waitress down when you wanted to order something .
Like i said earlier , if you are not willing to spend a grand or two on bottle service , skip this place .
The fries were perfectly cooked ( namely , well , but a little bit gravy - logged , which i like ) , the cheese was a little meltier than i would have liked , but blame that on it being take - away and there 's not much to do about the encased poutine in the ten minutes it took to get back to the office .
There was a hint of a-little - too - strong vinegar that probably comes from the pulled pork , but was not so strong as to adversely affect the overall flavour .
I had made a comment while sitting in walmart parking lot , that i did not see the food truck when i got to the location in peoria .
Not sure if they have free wireless which might be the reason there was lots of seating .
You really can not go wrong with this cozy hangout spot !
Inside not much of a surprise , menu above , counter to order and get food at and tables .
The enchiladas were soft and mushy , likely out of a tray and not made to order .
I may go back to try a burrito but i am in no rush .
You can not go wrong with a battleship or if you are really feeling it , a super battleship .
This is not a place really where you order and sit down to get your grub on .
Do not forget to get a turner 's tea while you are there too !
Not sure how much of a " chain " this place is but i have never heard of it outside of arizona .
We do not ever order domino 's or pizza hut since you can get better quality food here for the same price or less .
I would not call it authentic chinese food , but for the price , it 's well worth a visit .
You dine on plastic utensils , but at least you do not have to worry about baked on food on your utensils or lipstick stains on your tea cup .
You can not beat that !
They stayed open later to service all my needs and i did not feel rushed at all .
The sauce is ok and not too sweet .
First order we learned to order them extra crispy because if not ... the skin is soft and soggy .
This is the first time we ordered online , extra crispy wings and 1 cold cut sandwhich and we were not happy .
Wings were not cooked extra crispy .
I think we will keep to the traditional sauce , we may not order online again and we will pick .
I am fairly new in town and i have tried numerous nail salons to find someone that gives a great pedicure , but i have not had much luck ... until yesterday .
I was greeted by a friendly receptionist , as well as trish , was offered a beverage and was promptly taken back to the pedicure room , which was not only clean and beautiful , but also very tranquil and relaxing .
Can not say how delightfully surprising it was to find all the sausage and big hunks of chicken ... quality + quantity = awesome !!!!
I think i 'd give this place a better rating if they do not pretend to be a private lounge in the middle of the casino .
He let us have the table anyway because it was not packed that night .
Not good .
Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit .
I did not find the service here too great .
No one bothered to come clean it off so it became self - service .
I do not expect to walk into a place and feel like i am at the gap and get a " hi , there !
The outside might not be super impressive to look at , but the inside was beautiful ( as per usual for the embassy suites ) .
The manager 's special is always a nice touch that embassy offers ( though i have not been to many that limit your drinks with tickets ) .
We did not eat at the restaurant located in the hotel , but it looked tasty and it s a good option for travelers who do not want to go far but also do not want fast food .
I have stayed in many embassy for business travel in the past , so i know the protocol , but imagine if this was your first visit to this hotel and did not know where everything was .
When you approach the front desk is it not standard nor customary these days to say hello or how can i help you .
Realize it not the westin , mandarin hotel nor omni .
As for manager reception , it 's great there is no charge for patrons but stale chips and nacho chips - what is up with that ?
We complained but no one seemed to care .
Then when our car finally made it through the wash it was rushed the inside was not cleaned properly .
Do not do that .
I do not recommend any of the tnt carwashes on the west side of town .
We even called the district manager several times yet to this day have not received a call back .
I ordered a waffle and 30 minutes later it was still not ready .
I asked them what is going on with the waffle and they said the waffle irons have not be cleaned in 2 days !
Me and my family were so mad we kinda sorta went off on them and we made them not include the waffle in our bill .
It did not really look like thin crust and it was kind of soggy .
Banh mi boys is a toronto institution , so i will not go into details about what it is .
So not only was it tasty , it was cheap .
It is close to the freeway so even though i do not live very close i will be going back soon .
What 's up with not being able to smoke until 9 ?
I am pregnant and you just do not heel that fast when you are pregnant .
I ended up wearing flip flops to a steak dinner because i could not tolerate my heels .
But if you do not feel like wings , the rest of the menu is quite good too .
Had been to their original downtown location many times and usually you do not expect it to be as good .
The buddhas delight had no tofu in it , and the brown sauce leaked all over the inside of the bag and over the other food .
Not as strong of a dr pepper taste as i was expecting , but still a good flavor .
Wow , did not see this one coming .
Probably will not be back because it 's in the westgate unless it i am back at the convention center .
The one salad dressing they include is never enough , so ask for two , but at $ 7 , this salad is a surprise winner and bargain at the house .
I do nt understand why u would not you would not start a pizza when u realize u at that low .
Also the 3 slices we got we are not even room temperature .
As a vegetarian , i know some people will say i am not knowledgeable enough to review a poutine place ; however , i have lived in montreal & in ottawa , where i have had many authentic plates of this quebec specialty .
I understand they have to refrigerate them here ( unlike quebec & ottawa ) so you will not get the full squeak , but these were still below par even for alberta 2 ) 2 of the 3 times i ate there , some of the fries were overdone to the point of being rock hard .
Will not be back .
There was still no table available that is really worth it .
So as the wine , but of course it is not fine dinning .
We decided not to have dessert , because it was not made in - house like other food .
If we were not here at calgary as a day trip , we are so gon na ry more flavours .
It 's nice going to a place with all sorts of different poutine options , but i can not say that i was impressed with the food .
It is definitely worth checking out with friends , but i am in no rush to head back anytime soon .
Do not let their booming top 40 's music let you think of it as anything else .
Other patrons need not bother coming by .
If you want to have a more dynamic , dance - filled experience , do not go here .
If you have not tried this food truck , do not hesitate , the hype is 100 % warranted !
While it did not knock my socks or wow me , it reminded me of a few things i whip up at home now and again .
It 's not the best breakfast in town , but it 's probably better than you can make at home ... and with none of the cleanup work .
This was simply not my thing .
The disappointing thing was the fries , i could taste that the oil was not fresh and i had much better .
Please note that i am an big fan of poutine , but this was definitely not my style .
It felt unhealthy and did not sit well afterwards .
You can not go wrong .
If you get jordan , tzedenko ( not sure of the spelling ) , or the guy with glasses as your waiter ( i forget his name but he 's also a doll ) they treat you like family .
But turnover seems pretty fast so far , so your wait should not be too long !
The internet is also not free , which always is a - 1 star for me .
To top it off the food was not so good either .
The king crab oscar was not lacking - huge pieces of king crab , asparagus and bearnaise sauce - just enough to be the perfect accompaniment to the 7 oz filet .
I am not a huge fan of viet sandwiches so i do not have them often .
The pulled pork was slightly dry and not saucy enough .
As for the pork belly i could not taste the ' 5 spice ' , in fact there was not much flavor .
The pork belly meat was surprisingly slightly tough , not as tender as i anticipated .
The taco skin was not your typical taco soft shell , but tasted more like a roti kinda style .
Really casual door policy , they were not even paying attention as we walked in , and i never got carded .
Do not under any circumstances order water .
We usually never go out for italian food , because most places do not go beyond pizza and pasta .
At first we were afraid it would not be enough food ...
Maybe not a good first date place because it 's hard to hear each other talk , but definitely has good mood lighting .
The poutine was not as good as i had expected .
Too many fries , not enough cheese curds !
Incredibly salty dish , not sure if it was the fries or the gravy or combination of both but was huge salt overload and so hard to eat .
Unfortunately due to the extremely over salty poutine and the incredibly burnt fries , i will not be back again - it 's a shame as i presumed that a place dedicated to just poutine would at least make an ok product but this was not even edible .
It did not taste that good to me .
They were old and not the cleanest .
Would stay again , but would not be my first choice .
I let dan know of the situation and i asked if he could fix the cracked nail at no cost .
He fixed the cracked nail and he also repainted all my other nails and filed them so that the chips were not so noticeable .
Of course i will not go back to the lady that did my nails the 1st time period
Then i got a glass of wine and the menu , another minutes we nt by ... then i ask for the signature dish of the place : dry age meat , and they did not have any .
Why did not they aware the customers that they do not have the signature dish ?
I ask for some sauce that did not make the table , i had to ask to refill my glass .
Lamb shank - 3.5 / 5 a little bland at my most recent visit but still a good dish calamari - 4 / 5 pretty small portion but fresh pasta 4 / 5 i do not recall which of the 3 choices they have we got but you got could taste the fresh ingredients being used
This is the go - to restaurant in my neighbourhood when i do not feel like cooking .
Great thing is that i do not have to miss those meals anymore ...
No rubbery or mushiness here .
It was nicely seasoned with rosemary and they had the right balance so it did not overpower the duck flavour .
Those individuals had a lot more personable attention but i did not feel left out being a first time customer .
You will not be disappointed .
They were still stuff on the carpet , it was not exactly clean and the corners of the windows were still dirty like the rag missed that part of the window .
My car definitely was cleaner when they were done then when i first brought it in however they did not do a great job .
Terrible chili bad service not worth the walk from the hotel !!!
There service is the worse . i would not step in there if my life depended on it
The cheese curds did not melt at all , and had no flavor .
The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore .
The chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore .
The food is always good and usually the wait is not too bad .
When i emailed the managers about the situation , they did not really accommodate us or fix the problem .
Bottom line , do not think we are going back there .
I love that it has not changed a bit in the two decades i have been going there .
I can not help comparing it to blt steak popovers since that is their signature bread .
Manhattan sirloin good but not great .
Cooked exactly right but not sure why not in love .
Not really any black truffles , tons of sliced mushrooms of other kinds , salty & barely any lobster .
Sent back & did not eat .
Not sure why they would lie when the neighbouring tables had similar orders .
Disgruntled and annoyed that there was not even an apology .
No complains here ..
Great selection of beer and wine , can not beat the happy hour 1:00 to 8:00 every day .
A note for vegetarians - do not be deterred by the menu - they are always great about swapping meat with veggie options !
The final straw for me was when i saw a small group of flies buzzing around next to the window near my table ... at first i did not think anything of it ; i thought they were outside the window .
I shall not come back to this particular waffle house .
I did not eat it .
Will never be back .
Can not go wrong with anything : to date have tried 5 spice pork bun tacos : pulled pork , beef bao : fried chicken everything is good to very good .
First , i could not believe the prices .
This is las vegas , not manhattan or san francisco .
Second , the bouncer carded my 55 year old step - dad and when he said his id was in the room , security would not let him in .
I understand that in the abundance of caution , you have a policy that you card everyone , but should not management give their staff just a little bit of flexibility to use some common sense .
" hmmm , man with bald head and a gray mustache .... who 's old enough to be your dad , why not let this guy in ??!? "
The place would not give us water - period .
No other lounge in the bellagio has this policy .
If you have trouble finding this truck around town , you will have no trouble finding it at food truck fridays .
The wings do not look like your typical wing .
For a high end steakhouse it was not as expensive or crowded as others i have been to in vegas .
I suppose being in a value hotel / casino like the westgate hurts some of it cache , but make no mistake it 's as good as any steakhouse anywhere .
I can not believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers .
Shared the following with hubby ... arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $ 12 - this was the best dish of the evening ( sad is not it ?
That " homemade " sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes ... but it was not that impressive .
Meatballs - big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella , smothered in sauce $ 13 - i did not like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it .
Was not even served hot .
Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if i had known , i would have removed this table long ago ( they attached another small table to one end ) .
Not coming back again .
No one was full and we got wings afterwards .
This piece of shit place does not even answer the phone .
I put a $ 20 bill on the bar to pay for the drinks and am humiliated by the snooty bartender who tells me that 's not enough money .... two 12 oz bottles of bud light = $ 22 plus tip practically empty on sunday night at 9 pm except for a few sweaty golfers .
I guess not many people like jamie like we do .
The restaurant was out of several of their steaks and sides , but we were not informed of this upon being seated so we ended up ordering several items before the server finally told us they had the 3rd steak my husband tried to order and i ended up getting the salmon .
It was not very busy so i am not sure where the confusion was .
I would have had a better experience if our server would have been more attentive and also would have at least let us know up front what they did not have so we knew .
Banh mi boys never disappoints .
It 's by no means gourmet .
Then after we are seated and waiting she tells ya she can not help us !
No thank you ma'am .
I will never be back update :
I do not care if you put up video .
Your staff could ya e told me when i first came in they could not accommodate me .
Not telling me they would then changed their .
The day was may 18 i was getting my husbands truck washed , after sitting there for about an hour and my truck not being completed i was started to get upset .
This is a dark blue truck and it sat in the sun for about a half an hour and was not touched so the water marks were drying .
This stopped him in his tracks , he turns around and said , " cant you read no refunds . " well chompie i actually can read i am college educated .
I hope he can read and all the others that will read this and not go to this car wash .
I have four vehicles and multiple siblings that live in the area that will not go to this car wash .
They are gentle and takes there time and not just try to hurry to finish .
The thin gravy had no flavor but the cheese curds were authentic .
I have not had good pancakes like this in a while .
Ordered 100 wings amongst 4 people , took a bunch home since we could not finish .
She was great at connecting with her customers and did not make it seem hard or awkward at all .
This service we had was pretty good , understood the words that we ordered but not actually getting it right .
We are not picky customers so we did not care that much .
There are almost no tables , no sign to either wait to be seated or to seat yourself , and no reception area whatsoever .
Soups are in sturdy plastic containers and they do not scrimp on size , or give less because they do not have a large enough container .
They do not go cheap in this area , even their napkins are nice and thick good napkins .
Yet you get a lot more not just with volume but where it counts .
When i order a meat dish , there is tons of meat , not filled with oversized chunks of onion or a disproportionate amount of baby corn or bamboo shoot and other filler .
When i order a shrimp soup from other thai places i m usually hoarding the shrimp , saving it because there are only 5 . at little dumpling i am never for more meat or key ingredients like mushrooms .
The beef is usually good , not the poor quality small grey chewy scraps you find at other chinese places .
I m not talking about a morton 's cut , im speaking comparatively .
I have tried many other thai places , and no tom yum kung comes even close to comparing .
And steer clear of their japanese dishes , like teriyaki bowl - i do not know why you would order that from places like this anyways , and if you are that person , you probably do not listen to reviews and tips anyways
If i could give this place no stars , i would .
I have only been to this place twice , but the last time made the final decision to never return .
Never once did i hear my number be called .
That did not sit too well with me especially since they check the numbers before handing out the food .
There was no apologies from anyone .
I did not even want the food by then .
I defintiely will not be returning and i will not recommend anyone to this place .
It 's not like the mexican burrito wraps .
The beef was tasty and they put kimchee on all their tacos so if you do not like kimchee , make sure you tell them not to include them .
We were not that hungry so after 1 of each we were full .
Not sure if they can survive paying the rent in this area at their prices .
Formerly was woodie wood chucks ( i believe ? ) , walking into the restaurant you would not recognize .
All the wings were good however the fries not the best .. not compared to wild wings .
All the wings were good however the fries not the best .. not compared to wild wings .
Not in an annoying fashion , but in a wonderful service fashion .
You just really do not get that anymore .
I can not wait to go back !
Do not miss the calamari , veal sausage and lamb shank .
The just do not take the time to do a nice job .
When paying $ 23.99 you should expect a professional job , which does not happen .
I do not usually stop at food trucks but this is not your grandma 's food truck !
You will not be disappointed .
Not sure as to why there are bad reviews , but also have not been here long enough to know what real poutine should be like .
When i showed up to the restaurant they told me they could not take the coupon because i ordered it online and paid for it .
No where on this coupon says no online orders so i thought i was safe , boy was i fooled .
I would appreciate it when places hand out coupons they would go by what the coupons says and not make up some other criteria on the fly .
If i could give 0 stars i would , do not eat here .
Food was horrible , they could not even properly make rice or lo mein .
My boo and i stopped in for lunch and sat ourselves , but did not realize the table was dirty till we sat .
A lady came over to wipe it and did not acknowledge our existence whatsoever ... super awkward and she looked miserable as all hell .
Lucky this woman was not our server .
I got the bbq chicken appetizer dip as my meal because i had t before at the cranberry location and it was fantastic ... this time tho it was not as delicious .
That did not make sense to me because the spinach artichoke dip comes with the flatbread and it 's the same price ... but whatever .
Even if it was not close to my home i would drive 45 min to get here .
I will not go anywhere else .
Do not cone expecting the world 's best egg drop soup or pants - dropping fried rice .
I will say this , i have not had a bad experience here in the many times i have attended and i will give you a tip ... if you are going on a friday and think you will sit at the bar , be forewarned , you probably will not .
Do not mean to be stereo type , but the illegal immigrants that this place has working on your cars can not even speak a lick of english .
When i asked what the hell was going on , they just gave me their idiocy , by staring at me and saying " no blah blah " , they do not speak english now , have a good day with a smile .
Stopped by for a quick bite and everyone was surprised to see that i have never had banh mi boys before .
I have heard great things and bad things about banh mi boys ( mostly bad things from my viet gang telling me it 's not even close to real banh mi ) the line was a bit long but it moved quickly and there was a large space to wait for your food .
The tofu did not even taste like tofu , the mushroom sauce and lemongrass flavour made it soo delish .
Fries did not feel soggy from the kimchi , and the tofu slices were huge .
No doubt .
If you have not tried one , you need to asap !
Since it was not pre-cut , i tore it in half crosswise , which gave each of us 14 " to chow down on .
The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses , with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables .
The bread was substantial and of good quality , and did not tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub , as lesser quality bread does .
Absolutely can not go wrong with a triangle battleship .
Have never had a bad sub
Chicken tacos were not very good .
Gigantic burrito was not very good .
Probably will not be back again .
I have been to many different nail salons and i have never had a technician who pays such close attention to detail and cares for each client .
It 's not a tiny store , they have couple seats and tables around the restaurant .
This was and is the worst experience that i have had eating out at a chinese restaurant with my family i watch them scrape food into pans to put away with dates on it for tomorrow employees eating out of pans in the rear of the restaurant where we were seated had to basically beg for someone to do a stirfry on the grill because they had all ready cleaned it up for the night items were not replaced with fresh things were hard and rubbery and this would not be a place that i will go back to ever again customer service was crappy worst experience ever what was supposed to been an enjoyable evening with two graduates turned into a crappy night plain and simple do not go there if you expect decent service because you will not get it
Worst nights stay ever due to noisy plumbing all night long , doors banging all night and a noisy toilet that was not properly affixed to floor .
It does not meet expected standards .
My daughter , who would have rather been at mcdonald 's , ordered a plain cheeseburger ( $ 3.25 ) without the hash browns ( they do not serve ff ) , and i ordered something like a philly steak melt ( $ 7.65 ) .
I appreciated that as i did not feel like chewing too much -- my teeth hurt .
The cook felt that i would be missing out if i did not have sautéed mushrooms on my sandwich and suggested it .
Barron 's never disappoints !
Do not know that i 'd want to spend the whole night there .
The service is piss poor and they can not get orders straight .
I asked for cream for my growing cold coffee twice , i got the wrong order of hashbrowns and no syrup for my waffle .
Place was awesome , and the staff she was great and the food came out quick and fast , food was yummy , so do not mine being back and do some shopping and eat some pizza after and wings too .
When walking in the salon was not busy and everyone in the salon had great customer service .
Normally that would not bug me but i felt terribly rushed the entire time and i wish i only paid the $ 25 for the quick pedicure since that 's what i received .
I really did not like it because she kept drilling her thumb consistently over one area on the top of my foot .
I did not enjoy any part of my pedicure and massage .
I am not trying to be a baby or over - exaggerated i am just very upset that i paid an extra $ 10 for a relaxing spa pedicure and received a rushed pedicure and no legitimate massage .
I could not tolerate how hot the stones or the towels were which sucked because i felt like they did not even feel anything before putting them straight on my skin .
I feel bad leaving this review because everybody was super friendly however i am not satisfied with the care i received especially for the price i paid .
Booths have tv with the nfl ticket so you do not need bar space to catch the game you want to see .
Looks like their sit down dinners are pretty decent too , but have not had them yet .
Place is usually busy but it is big enough where space is not an issue .
I love this restaurant , why not give it five stars !
A few imperfections can not slight the fact that it is always a wonderful time .
I do not usually stop at food trucks but saw this one and was intrigued by the menu .
Does not get better than that .
Barely walked in and the customer service was the worst lady at the front was so rude i had gastric bypass and need to eat off the kids menu she would not honor the card would even look at the card just put her hand in my face that she does not honor it very poor customer service i walked out with all of my children
We 'd never ordered from them before , but looked at their menu and thought their sandwiches looked pretty good .
No problem , they are covering their ass !
But i must say it was not a great first impression !
Never visiting here again !!
I was not in a hurry but apparently my nail tech was despite the empty shop and no customers waiting .
Did not think much of it .
Do n't ask why , idk .
I did not understand the conversation between him and an older lady but he turned and asked did i want gel or regular full set .
All of a sudden " they were busy " and could not fit me in .
I asked within the next 3.5 hours that they are open , there 's no availability ?
I was not planning on coming back or staying but i was just blown away by the blatant unprofessionalism and poor customer service .
So goes without saying , i will never step foot or refer anyone there again .
I had foodies request that i try to check out banh mi boys to do an updated visit and review , since i last said i we nt here before i started this account and had not written anything up .. but people wanted to know what i thought ; i only remembered my last meal being way too dry at a different spot .
My order not only came out quick and super huge ( a lot bigger than i remembered ) , but steaming hot in a fresh , fluffy , soft bread with an incredibly juicy mix of medium sriracha heat and mayo beneath the squid .
Actually also got a drink , label said it was fruit punch but totally tasted like cream soda 100 % hahaha luckily i did not mind it either way , was a refreshing way to wash down the rest of the food .
Worst car wash ever i tried to give them so many chances but they never do a good job .
The girl at the counter at the 17 ave location ignored us and said she does not take the groupon cash only when asked what store does she told me the other store in kensington i asked her where was it and she had no idea :( not impressed by her paying more attention to here text messages than her customers came into the kensington location 207 10 th st nw and was treated way better !!
It was packed when we were there on a sunday night , but not uncomfortable at all .
This proves that the ingredients are very fresh ( which is probably why the food is so tasty ! ) but be careful not to become to attached to certain dishes , as the next day they may be gone .
I am not too big on desserts anywhere , but we ordered everything off the dessert menu , and everything was great .
This is a traditional italian restaurant , and the menu is not huge , but as i said everything we ordered tasted great , and i really liked the atmosphere .
Not only do we always know we will get great drinks , but we also know that trenton will take good care of us with no b.s.
That is no longer my perception .
They do not even have duck sauce for spring or egg rolls .
Additionally the sweet and sour sauce is not thick .
I can not stand places that draws you in with good quality cooking and then take short cuts and distribute lower quality product months later .
The fruit was not even ripe .
No pride in this establishment whatsoever .
Do not eat here folks .
Kids running through the hallways , car alarms going off all night long , staff completely unprofessional and not concerned about guests .
When i procrastinate on scheduling my next gel mani at my regular nail salon , i end up needing to find a place asap when i can not get in with my nail girl .
It 's a cute and clean salon with sweet staff that offers not just loads of gel color selections , but loads of regular polish colors too choose from on their walls of polish .
The gel manicure turned out nice , but the cuticle trimming was not done well .
It was not the best thing i ever ate , but i would definitely get the veggie lo mein again .
They serve food on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils , which i do not mind .
I have never had gels last such a short period of time .
Not sure if it 's their application process or the quality of their products , but sadly i will not be returning now with gels only lasting 2 weeks .
Was unwilling to budge on the price , or correct the work , even though it was clear it had not been done thoroughly .
And when i sent inside , the cashier did not have the coupons available .
Customer service was non-existent , work was shoddy , i will not be returning .
Extremely disappointing , and i will not be recommending it anyone .
We are not buffet lovers , but this place is the exception .
Do not dare wear a cute little outfit because you will smell like sausage , deep fry grease , and stale coffee forever .
I took my jacket off and left my room and came back to the whole hotel room smelling like waffle house , but not in a good maple syrup warmth way .
We stumbled upon this great , little place that played amazing music ( no house music - yes ! ) , a great crowd ( good - looking professionals that do not pull on your arm to talk to you - yes , yes ! ) , and no cover charge or lines to get in ( jackpot ! ) .

Ladies , there is enough space for dancing so that you do not have to get elbowed or felt - up by some questionable men .
Gentlemen , there is plenty of seating available , and - shocking - you do not need the scam that is bottle service to actually sit down .
No real complaints because it was free .
The hotel is far out , so if you are not driving , the options are limited for food and entertainment .
I was not pleased about the fact that there was not free wi - fi .
Because of the proximity from the rest of charlotte , i am not sure if i would stay here again .
Can not wait to try more of the menu .
The poutine was gross .. did not enjoy any part of it .. brewsters poutine is way better , plus they have yummy beer ... try theirs and then compare it to this crap and tell me which is better !!
I thought barros typically had good health / freshness standards but i guess not ...
I did not feel rushed at all .
She also saw me struggle while i was trying to talk on the phone and get my nails done so she gave me earphones to use so i would not struggle anymore .
I had an alternative color picked out if i could not find my color but she found a color and made it work for me .
I found the poutine here to be great , but not outstanding .
Curds : not that great .
They did not have that fresh " squish " to them , although you do not always get that for every single curd .
For poutine i 'd say this is a solid bet , but if you have been to , say , rural quebec and had poutine there , then do not expect this to beat it out .
I have been to the north park lounge in the past , but not at this location .
It was not until my boyfriend and i came here for my birthday this past week that we realized this one did not have games , a little disappointing , but we got over it , it was our own faults for not googling it before coming here .
I did not like how crammed you felt in here though .
Unless you sat at your own booth you are basically sitting side by side other people at other tables , and really can not have your own conversations .
I believe when i went years ago , i had some sort of parmesan crusted chicken and pasta , but did not see anything like that on this menu .
I took two bites of it and did not like it whatsoever .
There was next to no banana peppers in it , and it was 95 % cheese and like 5 % dough .
The food was not anything to brag over , the environment made me sort of claustrophobic .
My honest opinion is that i 'd only come here if invited by someone and definitely not by choice , but maybe to one that has games .
Do not be fooled by the exterior of the westgate .
I guess it 's just not hipster enough for some people .
It 's never really crowded when i stop by on any given afternoon but they certainly have a steady stream of customers coming in for delicious sandwiches .
Did not read any reviews but , my personal opinion is i got excellent service .
My husband and i were around the area and could not decide where to eat . i was in the mood for some variety and also wanted some crab legs so we stopped in .
All the food trays were not full ( not even half full ) and the food looked like they had been sitting there for a while .
Well the crab tray was never full and when it was replenished , they only brought out about a pound at a time .
Let me tell you i was not the only person eyeing the new trays brought out , but i was the farthest from the buffet table .
So i did not get as much as wanted .. just a couple legs .
We will not be going back here but i still was not able to leave china city super buffet behind after i left .
This place is always so dirty and grimy , been there twice and will not be back .
Cajun / mex fusion needed to happen , and the happening could not be in better hands .
Seven bucks gets you a breakfast bowl that 's filling enough to be the whole breakfast ( so you are not stuck blowing $ 20 - $ 25 across multiple trucks to not starve ) , but the portion 's not so huge that you can not justify a pastry from the market stands if one calls out to you .
I am not sure i intend to lick one , but i am ridiculously amused by having one .
Not moved by anything on the menu but the staff were super exellent .
If you are going the bao or taco route , get 2 as they are not enough on their own .
The flavours were also not the greatest .
I will never come here again for wings .
What 's worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance , really bad tasting food , and rude staff ?
I almost never eat at these big chain half - fast food restaurants .
I did not have high expectations , but i thought it would be better than taco bell .
The mushroom soup was good although it was not the most appealing looking dish there could be .
The problem here is i did not order it black and blue -- just blue .
I regretted not getting the truffle fries .
The prices are high and are in line with some of the better steakhouses on the strip which does not make sense .
The meal was ok but the food and the prices do not merit a return visit .
I could care less about drink prices , and do not mind paying a lot for drinks in vegas , but $ 20 was a bit much for a so - so martini with oreo crumbs at the bottom .
Love the bellagio , not wild about caramel .
Twice the have not honored the prices advertised on their menu .
Um , do not you have to change the menu on the wall then to reflect that ?
The food was good , sauces were on the side so the lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork were not soggy and the wonton soup was huge and good .
Decent car wash , can not recommend the oil change .
You have a problem and they will tell you they will get it handled for you and they do not .
They will tell you that owner or someone will call you back and no one will .
Cool place to chill , but did not know if we could get rowdy or buzzed off $ 14 + / drink so headed out elsewhere .
I thought it was like a rubio 's or something ... it just never stood out to me .
No idea it was there for months and months even though i knew there was an einstein 's ( which i have never been to ) .
It did not taste like greasy chemicals à la any - berto's .
I do not eat chinese / thai food the way it is traditionally prepared , i get steamed meat and vegetables with no added flavoring .
A fairly simple dish but it is surprising how many restaurants can not get it right .
I also like that this place packs the food to go in traditional chinese / thai food paper containers and not that irritating styrofoam !
Inside the restaurant was clean but you can not see any part of the kitchen from the order counter so i can not speak for the kitchen or its employees working back there .
I also like how they have a separate kids area so there are not tons of rugrats running around .
This place is not the most fancy , but it was clean and the food seemed to be made with good quality ingredients .
I would mark 3 stars if everything else was not so great due to the noise .
If i ever did come here again it would be with a large group of friends , i would not mind waiting 20 mins for service ... i would be socializing anyway .
And they just drizzle the sauce on the wings ... weird :/ well , i am glad i did not go here for wings :)
Not a single complaint from anyone .
Yelp has never let me down , so i will be giving this place a second chance in the near future .
One star for no cover .
It was our two guy friends first time and they had no idea what to expect .
The food is still good but it s not worth the money .
I made plans with a group of 6 last friday for a saturday night dinner in midtown -- not exactly the best timing .
( it 's not easy booking a large reservation the day before ) .
The wine list by the glass was small and i had a chianti which i would not recommend .
There were some bones in it , but it did not even matter it was so tasty .
Somebody had the linguini i did not try it but she loved it .
I can not give it a rating .
If you are looking for a casual , no fuss , home - cooked italian meal 7 numbers is the place for you .
If you want something a bit fancier with more complex favours , it may not be the best choice .
Tnt is the bomb ( no pun intended ) !
I was impressed that for $ 5 , you not only get to take your car through the main system , but a guy brushes the car before you enter and he cleans the windows by hand when you exit .
Never had a bad experience , thanks raul and the whole crew for taking care of business when i come in for a wash !
I have never had a bad meal here .
You can not go wrong here .
It 's brand new which is amazing in itself , the decor is super cute and the first time i came in , i did not want to leave !
They also have the cutest pedicure room which i have yet to use ( i will wait until summer for my pedicures ! ) but it 's dark so i can not wait to go in there and just fall asleep !
As a vegetarian i was thrilled to try their veggie bowl and i was not disappointed !
Perfectly spicy , but not too hot as to overpower the flavor of the cabbage , beans and rice .
I do not like paying more than $ 15 for a meal and if i do that , i want to be full at the end .
$ 20 at tops , if i am not doing buffet or all you can eat .
This is not my kind of restaurant , not because it has small tasting plates , but because these tasting plates are not in my desired price range .
Also not fried as crispy as i would like it .
Caprese salad ( $ 12.50 ) - i have never paid $ 12.50 for four slices of tomato and three average sized slices of cheese , two or three basil leaves and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil before .
Veal lasagna ( $ 10.75 ) - this was not horrible for the price , but i expected it to be bigger .
Tomato sauce was not overwhelming .
Pork chop ( $ 15 ) - alright in terms of portion , but by no means outstanding .
We were served two things that were not ours , and after we let them know , these two were removed from the table ( i think i might have accidentally breathed on the server 's arm as he put those two dishes on the table , or i may have breathed on those dishes themselves ... sorry to whoever received them after ) .
It was very nice of them to recommend hotel gelato for dessert after we told them we were not interested in cake .
Our table had two candles , and with the olive oil and the vinegar bottles along with the candles , it left not much space for our plates , which we were sharing .
Sure ... if i was not paying .
After a night here standing with a bunch of smokers , i did not smell like smoke , and that 's a testament to the vegas ventilation and the staff 's quick work .
I have not tried the bbq yet .
Not because it looks bad but there 's no covers on the meats & no one standing there to bbq so i am skeptical .
To make matters worse , they will not provide any property damage , or liability insurance information .
Update : 5 days later , no tow truck , no tire , no repairs .
No response .
In a yelp driven rage , he said " i am not fixing your piece of sh** 1996 jeep " and called the police to have me trespassed from the property .
Of course i was not trespassed .
Not likely .
Tnt did not answer the complaint .
I would encourage other customers to pursue damages against tnt if your vehicle was damaged and not repaired .
I have not been to a car wash in years .
I figured why not ... well when it was finished i had to go drive my car because they could not drive a standard .
Then they asked if it was okay , i immediately saw some marks but just let it go since i had a friend with me and she told me she has not been happy with them .
Well , i noticed the antenna was not put back on and there were a bunch of missed spots on the interior as well as the exterior .
The reason i did not mention the issues was because i was just happy that it looked better coming out than it did going in .
The wait was not long , the staff was friendly and they got the wash and wax completed in about half an hour .
I just moved here and i have never had barro 's pizza .
When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out , we noticed some " fried wontons " with our food that i did not order .
I have no idea what was in them , but they were greasy and good !
I got the chicken jamburrito and could not finish the whole thing in one setting .
Outside of the usually pleasant cashier or orser taker , people just look miserable , toss stuff around and generally have no concern for accidental damage to your stuff .
No wax , no buff , just a simple hand wash .
There are no standards , no supervisors spot checking quality .
Located inside of bellagio so of course this is not a jeans and t-shirt place .
All in all , it is a great cozy place to go to , when you want to meet your friends for a drink and chat , before you head out to a loud , noisy bar / club and will not be able to hear what anyone has to say .
I was also disappointed that a proper italian restaurant does not offer beef or salmon carpaccio - usually a staple in a good italian restaurant .
Then we asked for tiramisu and the waitress said that this location does not have it but their other location on danforth does .
We all looked at one another not quite sure what to do with this information ???
One of the best osso bucos i have had ( and i have had many all over the world including in italy ) overall not bad but definitely room for improvement ... prices are very reasonable .
Perfect combo of spicy andouille , eggs , cheese .... and other things that i can not think of .... and yummy salsa .
We have gone many times and the nano and the usb cable have always been left in the middle console and never touched .
The cop said he did see on camera the employee disconnecting the usb cable but could not see on tape where the employee put the cable along with the little nano as the camera was not clear enough to show that .
So since the employee denied having the nano and usb cable they said we were out of luck as they were not sure what happened to the nano and usb cable .
My mp 3 nano 16 gb was missing during cleaning , we saw on the video camera that the one man disconnected it but the police said they could not tell for sure if the guy took it because he was blocking the camera .
The manger then posted he was getting me a new one just for customer care , well it took a week to get it and it does not work in my car .
One the one hand it was nice of them to try , but they got someone elses used one , and i guess my lesson is to not use them anymore , and take everything out of my car at any car wash .
It 's a shame , because i just had my car detailed there about a month ago for 160 dollars , and my wife 's car detailed for 129 dollars , just a few weeks ago . i never had a problem at this car wash until now .
There was no cover for us and we got 2 for 1 drinks that night .
Had my car washed and oil changed there several times and never had a problem .
This was not the case they refused to honor their quote and refused to give me our cars !
And based on all the other reviews i am not surprised .
I can not wait to go back , very edgey and rich environment , dining room was beautiful and bar was sexy !
Some would argue there was no dance floor , but we danced some salsa and no one seemed to mind .
The place is kinda shady , does not accept bills over $ 20 after 2 pm .. lol ...
The ayce wing night on wednesdays , while sounds like a good deal , is not worth the money .
My waitress never checked up on us until we were ready to leave so the ayce pop was beyond pointless .
While the big cheese is no smoke 's poutinerie in quebec , it will do until my next visit out east .
The chips were good , but most of the flavour came from the caramelized onions , not the gravy .
And it had roast beef on it , not actual steak as in a philly .
I would visit again , but probably would not try anything with meat and mushrooms again .
If i was not married i might ask the chef to marry me !
I do not usually eat salad when out as i tend to splurge but i really needed something fresh that day .
My husband loved his steak jamburrito and could not control letting everyone know about it .
This place does not have a good reputation but i was in a hurry .
This was no problem on the phone but now it was .
Since i would not pay for the full detailing he would have to charge another twenty dollars because of the pee .
The handwritten slip he gave me did not match the receipt .
Would not use this service again .
Gave order ask if i could pay with cc over the phone not able to because had to be present with my card when picking up .
Dude tells me stop yelling which i was not i was just telling him to put it in and she will pay .
Called back and asked if he hung up on me and said yea and he will hang up again ... he did .. what an asshole wanted to drive down and handle it in person but not worth my time .
With this type of shit ass attitude business will decline if it has not done so .
If you do not mind a drive go to new york chinese or better yet if you want really great chinese food go to wo fat look them up .
I will never purchase from little dumplings and i will let a lot of people know the new staff sucks ass !!!
P.s. if you had the nerve to say , " me " ... well , i could not even hear you over the pleasant crunching of my jamburritos hushpuppies anyway .
For the price i could not believe all that was complimentary !
But , in a neighbourhood which is so impoverished that it only has a crack problem one day per month , that 's not hard to do .
While i can like the alternative it represents it could not become an absolute favourite of mine simply because its small and cluttered with staff .
The only thing i do not like about chico's is that it 's on the corner of mcdowell and 7th street , which makes turning left out of the parking lot almost impossible .
One of the best hoagies that pittsburgh has to offer is right here so be sure to check this place out if you have not already
Definitely a recommended stop if you are in the area but are not familiar with npl .
I can not believe this place has only 3 stars .
I paired then with pizza sauce and was not disappointed .
I m sorry , it was not good at all , being from montreal and reading my reviews and photos from poutine from there can tell you i have had a few .
I ordered their traditional large poutine , first there was little to no curds on it and not enough gravy to call it a poutine .
The gravy was not traditional poutine gravy it had no flavor no thickness just blah , the fries had a burnt taste or some ( taste ) and not a good one , my son refused to eat any more i tried one more bite but we ended up tossing it out :( .
The waitress was extremely rude , did not want to be there , i had to catch a plane and there were only a couple people i the place .
Took 40 mins to get food , people served after us got fed first , figured it was because we were not regulars .
The food was ok , but not worth 45 min wait for breakfast .
Did not know what to expect coming here , but got ta say i left very full and very happy .
Really they are great and taste like meatballs i have never had before ) , the veal lasagna ( he said it was great ) and lamb chops ( also good feedback ) .
Not only are the prices reasonable but the salon is impecable .
I think the waitress took one look at them and decided since they were under drinking age she would not make much money off them .
They waited 45 mins for a table and then she was very slow in taking their order and when they asked for seconds she made sure that she we nt very slowly so that they would not get much for their money .
By the way , they only give you 5 lousy wings for refills so that you are constantly reordering and they purposely make sure they are slow in serving so that you give up and leave and do not get your moneys worth .
Completely unimpressed and will not go myself or recommend to others .
Do not come here expecting great service .... come here for the food and the pool tables .
If you do not know what i mean then by all means keep eating here .
Clearly the food does not deter the masses who pack this place and olive garden etc .
The service is friendly and the outside patio is nice but i will not return because of the food .
We bought appetizers and did not get them till the food came .
I bought the second hottest one and was not hot at all .
The servers were nice but not efficient .
I can not speak on the oil changes but the reviews seem scary .... what i can comment on is the car wash , i have personally had my car done 3 time for the $ 15 dollar wash and it looks good , it 's what a $ 15 wash is suppose to be .
Certainly it could not match the quality of carnevino or john - georges ... could it ?
Well , i am not ready to say it 's better , but it is definitely on par .
And they were never let back down .
Bottom line : even though i can not get there on foot , and even though it will not contribute to my loyalty programs , i will be adding edge to my list of regular dining spots .
I do not really care to club , but lounges i will do anytime .
Also , happy hour can not be beat .
You can not really go wrong with the food here .
I was not able to stay to get the detail because i had an appointment to make , so i prepaid and came back the following week .
The wash was not even that great , but ?
Two hours later and they had not even pulled it into to get the detail .
It was parked in a sea of cars who also had not been helped .
No one came to notify us how long it would take .
No apology .
( we were not about to wait another two hours for it to get done ) when i called to reschedule my appointment because i could not make it in time for work , the guy said " you are rescheduling again ! ? " he is so lucky i did not flip out on him .
( we were not about to wait another two hours for it to get done ) when i called to reschedule my appointment because i could not make it in time for work , the guy said " you are rescheduling again ! ? " he is so lucky i did not flip out on him .
I calmly explained that i worked downtown and there was no way i would make it in time .
When i showed up the next morning for my 8 am appointment i was not helped until 8:08 .
Needless to say , we will not be back .
I 'd suggest you do not come either .
We get to the elevator and it is trashed and disgusting ( could they not at least kept one of the 3 elevators in decent condition ) ?
We get off on our floor and are greeted with no carpeting , but padding .
It did not stop at repairs either .
Just do not lie to your guests about the rooms . we informed them of our disappointment and the did give us some $ $ off but we will check out early regardless .
On another note , our floor has no carpet when getting off elevator and yet the others do .
Service was not too good , wait time is long especially after the first batch of wings .
But overall pretty enjoyable experience if you do not mind waiting at times !
The manager did not gave keys to the people that was going to detail my car so they had no idea how to clean a manual transmission car .
The car seems like it was never detail !
Do not get me wrong , i brought my scion xb here before and they were awesome ... but now , they do not seem to value customers anymore .
Very upset over the crap we endured last night they would not take a reservation over the phone and then we were informed it was a 90 minute wait with standing room only ... not impressed
It was my second visit , and definately not stellar .
My friend mentioned that he 'd never had such poor service , even in nyc.
When we got home , we found they 'd botched his order ( asked for no onions , and got tonnes of onions ) , but were not about to walk back , and deal with this dude again .
Not going to lie this was not our first choice but with everyone trying the hotel for the first time and to book a party of 13 @ the last minute was not available .
One thing that i found lacking was the service - we were " led " to our table soon after arriving , but it really was not completely clear where we were supposed to sit .
We were given ipad menus which was surprising , and especially surprising when we realized that they did not contain the actual food menu .
Both are great ways to present a menu , but i really do not think they complement each other when used in conjunction .
The calamari was not battered , it had a lovely light flavour to it , and it was cooked to perfection .
No one was at the front and when we walked in , there were about half dozen people drinking .
No music , no service .
All the food is horrible here i gave this place a couple of chances never enjoyed a single thing .
If you do not want to get sick then do not ever go eat here ..... when i finally got my beer from last saturday it was flat and my glass was hot which made my beer warm .
Typically you can not find complex flavors and spices unless you dabble with indian dishes ( curries and such ) .
The burger that i had was not exceptional but ok .
All in all if you r in the area and you have this as an option , you will not loose .
And they serve it with some sort of cheesey sauce that may or may not be illegal in other states .
They also have a strictly enforced dress code starting at 9 . they almost did not let coach in at 5 because he was wearing flip - flops , even though he had a collared shirt .
Great place , not what you initially expect from the outside i must admit .
He explained about the restaurant and how we came at the perfect time as the extraordinary ( my words not his , lol ) chef steve had just created a new spring menu .
Next course was the english pea soup with morel mushrooms , mind you i am not a fan of mushrooms but i had to try it , and was i surprised as to how amazing it was !
The lobster mac & cheese had the right amount of cheese and lobster , not too much of either , so yummy !!!
My boyfriend has the john dory , a fish i have never tried before , but was it absolutely delicious !!!!
We wrapped up the meal with the vanilla bean creme brulle , which i have never really been a fan of at other restaurants , chef steve has officially changed my mind on that , at least at the edge steakhouse anyways !
I have not had a disappointing item .
It was so nice not having the only kid in a restaurant .
I did not see only white women either , it was actually a pretty diverse flow of customers from moms with kids , older retirees , young solo hipsters , and all of multiple various ethnicities .
No organization what 's 6/10/18 called in my order and was given a 30 minuet pickup time , prior to hanging up he changed my time to 45 minuets .
65 dollar steak and they do not know how to cook
If not i suggest the panda express next door .
Either way , this is the best cajun food i have had -- i am no expert though -- my taste buds were in love .
I asked the server twice for ice , but she did not bring it .
The restaurant was not busy at all .
Unfortunately , the lasagne was very greasy , and i could not finish it .
I do not know if i would come back to this restaurant because there are soooo many restaurants in the city .
I do not consider myself a great cook .
My boyfriend never had a pedicure so i wanted my boyfriend to have a good experience and decided to come here .
The crab legs were just ok ; definitely not fresh , but not terrible .
It was a little loud , but not obnoxious .
You can not beat the prices for the amount of food on the plate and there 's enough of a selection for the kids to enjoy something too .
I have not seen many places offering little savory foods .
Which is why i never reviewed them previously because every visit is different .
The latter has not happened in a while .
There was also no layering of cheese which made the second half very boring .
When i asked if the mac & cheese poutine was worth a try the server told us that it depended on the cook that day ... i guess she was honest , but not really what i was expecting to hear .
Not sure exactly what music they were playing but it hurt my head !
I will not be going back again , nor will i try any other big cheese locations .
Feeling sad that this did not impress given my love for great poutine ;(
Hey i know there is always someone passing out some kind of card ( s ) in the hotels or strip , you never know it could be !
I am not big on writing reviews , but nothing motivates me more to do so then getting a severe case of diarrhea after a highly anticipated first visit .
I thought the taste was okay , but my gf thought it was way too salty and could not eat more than two bites .
I am sure you do not want the health inspector breathing down your neck .
Still no apology since my visit on may 17th , so this review will stick .
However , we tried their thai menu tonight , and they have no business offering this menu .
Only knocked down 1 star because i assumed that on a thursday night this club would be a little more poppin ' but ..... it was not .... it 's a small lounge with a modern look inside ... it was almost empty , a big group celebrating a birthday and some others .... cover was free which is always a plus , and the reason why i gave it 3 stars is because the music was really good :) all the good new songs were playing and i could not stop shaking my ass .
So now i am $ 250 in the hole and 2 weeks later my carpets still have mold which means i can not drive my vehicle because i have a newborn and mold spores are dangerous .
I have placed numerous tickets online asking for a phone call and i can not get a call back .
You must try it if you never have !!!
Both were really good , but can not say excellent .
Fantastic service and the food was sensational it is pricey so be prepared to spend when coming to this one but in all honesty , you can go to cheaper and wished you never spent the money and save it for a brilliant meal here !
The first weekend they did not bother calling when they were closed so we showed up to a dark office .
- no dancefloor - many lounge chairs & tables - mostly the latest hip - hop , r&b music - free admission i we nt here with my friend on a sunday night .
The music was very danceable , however , without a dancefloor , maybe it was not so danceable afterall .
Caramel is a bar very much more for lounging since it 's not so grand .
I will return here on a night in vegas when i do not want to spend too much money & want to listen to top 40 's hits .
Ironically enough , i did not get the burrito because i have seen my share of korean burritos , indian burritso , etc so i wanted to try something else and plus sometimes the tortilla is just eh and i just like the filling inside a burrito better . :)
The cheese was piled on top of it and i am not sure if it would have matter if there was cheese or not for me because i think the rice , chicken and sausage with the seasoning and sauce is good enough for me !
We have never been to a barro 's pizza and we moved close to this location .
Yep , if you pronounce the a , then i am one of those people who irritates you by not pronouncing it .
It 's a classy joint where you can get away with wearing your cargos and chuck taylors and never hear a word about it .
And , this place satisfies those rare urges of mine when i want to go to a club , but do not want to deal with the usual club hassles .
We came here for our last summerlicious dinner and it definitely did not disappoint .
They had a beer on their menu which i have never seen anywhere else called sweetwater and if you like a nice light beer to have with an appetizer , this is a good pick .
Three of us ordered off the summerlicious menu and the other 2 could not help themselves and ordered off the regular menu .
Two others had lasagna which did not disappoint and i had the orechiette which was so flavourful and delicious .
I know they will not disappoint !
The room was terrific , breakfast was incredible - i stay at plenty of hotels with a continental breakfast , but not too many that will cook to order complimentary .
I did not get to take advantage of it this time , but they also have a manager 's reception every afternoon where you can get free drinks .
I read about people complaining about noise , but i did not hear any .
You might want to request the top floor if you are sensitive to noise based on what others have said , but again i did not have any issues .
Got the hot stone pedi paid extra and did not get a good message .
Told the manager how unhappy i was and it did not seem to faze him .
Will not go back
I really want to be able to give this cute independent eatery 5 stars , but they just can not seem to get the service part of their business together .
I should not have to wait 30 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich and a breakfast biscuit only to have them get my order wrong .
The food is good , but not worth the wait .
The service is not on par though .
Do not be fooled , these steamed buns are quite large , i expected more of a snack size .
I can not wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a battleship .
I stopped by for a $ 5 happy hour sangria and i can not wait to come back !
They do not have a ton of cocktails but there are so many drink options that i can not imagine anyone not finding something they love .
The sangria was very sweet , so if that 's not your thing , go for one of the dozens and dozens of beer options .
Service was friendly and professional : not rushed , but not made to wait either .
First there was construction all over the place and it was not listed on their website .
No dice , the clerk sounded as if it were my fault that i had to move !
Paint chips , water damage , pissed off staff , no assistance with moving .... not what i expected at an embassy .
Paint chips , water damage , pissed off staff , no assistance with moving .... not what i expected at an embassy .
I am being a bit dramatic on the train , but the totality of the problems makes it a place that i can not and will not recommend .
I have came here several times for pedicures and i enjoyed it each time so i decided to try getting my nails done here as well and after a not a good result i debated about coming back but i reached out to them about my experience and the boss called me directly to apologize and to make sure that my nails we are fixed up and up to my standard and wow they did not disappoint .
He set me up with a appointment right away and i could not be happier .
Also i have been to many nails shops and i have never been to one so " fresh " like usually when you step into a nail salon you are overwhelmed by the smell of acetone and nail polish but this one nope no smell it 's was super nice to actually enjoy clean air while getting my nails done hahaah
I do not know why i return to this carwash expecting a better experience .
Do not like the windshield repair sellers at the check - in line and the store is sadly bare inside .
The place inside is clean although the customer service is not all that good .
I am vietnamese and i never really like " banh mi " in toronto .
Fresh hot and never emptied food choices .
5 stars for the grilled pork banh mi ! - these are not your grandfather 's $ 2 banh mi sandwiches , there 's no pate nor tons of mayo , just caramelized grilled pork deliciousness , with sweet pickled veggies and your preferred level of heat .
No , not the kimchi fries - i love kimchi , i love fries , the combination , with all the sauce and pork and everything , is just too busy for me .
Delicious , well balanced , and the soft taco shell is grilled and tasty , and not nearly as annoying as the bland , doughy steamed bao .
Though i can not tell how the oil change is the car wash was fine .
Not that this is acceptable for anyone but based on my travel experience i am aware that this does not meet the standards of the hilton family ...
I like my pizza cooked but not that cooked .
Not for the salty sexy duck leg .
I just can not say enough great things about this place !
Another 10 minutes go by before we get our coffee ... but no water !
Not a hard order .
Her scrambled eggs were not cooked all the way .
When we asked for more coffee she did not come back .
Never coming back and this experience has put me off from any waffle house .
Does not matter we are not going to any one of these places again .
A friend who is a local recommended this place since it 's more of a lounge scene and not an obnoxious nightclub .
Two things - 1 . yes , she knows that these are not typical alkies to mix but we did just read a full article ( with pics and recipes ! ) in the lv magazine about bartenders and their creative elixirs using whiskey and bourbon and 2 .
Rolled his eyes , got on his high and mighty hat and said " people who drink whiskey and bourbon do not mix them with anything " really !?!
Because last time i checked , when i am paying close to $ 20 f* ( * ing dollars for a drink i do not think i asked for judgment from a las vegas bartender .
After he made the drinks he said he had to close out the tab on the 3 drinks , to which we said we still needed 2 more and he just said " well , i have to close out the tab while you guys decide . " gee , i must be the idiot that thought bars make their money off drinks and not forcing people the close out when they are not ready .
I have actually never had this happen before .
Maybe my illustration did not fully justify how rude and arrogant he was but we were completely disgusted .
5 stars for the grilled pork banh mi ! - these are not your grandfather 's banh mi sandwiches , there 's no pate nor mayo , just caramelized grilled pork deliciousness , with sweet pickled veggies and your preferred level of heat .
2 stars for the porkbelly bao - the meat was not as nicely caramelized as one would hope , and the bao is too doughy and bland , and personally just does nt do it for me .
I found this location to be just a half - step behind the yonge & gerrard location , but still great , the wait is not anywhere near as bad , plus there is street parking here , so it s a winner overall .
Too bad i do not have one by my house . :)
I can not figure out how a public place that was remodeled 2 years ago can avoid handicap access ..... shame on mccandless township and the owners of this establishment for your bathrooms .
I have certain places i hit all the time while in vegas , and this usually is not one of them , but we were entertaining my father 's step children while they were in town for business and they did not want to venture to one of my usual spots .
They attempted to charge us cover while walking through the petite door in the front , and i told them who i knew , all of a sudden the red rope opened , my father was surprised i pulled it off ( do not doubt , of course i did , remember i own las vegas ) , and we walked in .
I took a peek at the person 's tab next to me though who actually needed to pay and it was , with no surprise , not inexpensive .
The guests we had were not used to going out in vegas and kinda just did the white boy rock out in the center of the floor , but whatever , it did not look like they were with us anyway so i was not trippin ' too hard .
I need southern accents and trailer trash working in waffle house 's , not phoenix college boys and girls .
I usually never vary from a pecan waffle and a small order of hash brown covered and smothered with an orange juice .
The waffle area was a holy mess of batter ( a good thing ) and the cook was an older lady who did not have much personality , but the waffle and browns hit the spot .
I am not a coffee drinker , so i always feel like a bit of a fraud when talking about cafes ...
I tried one of their scones ( can not remember the flavour ) and it was so - so.
A lot of people waiting for their to go orders and not one person was at the counter at all times , which is understandable .
I mean , i read the reviews coming here but one of my friends was a regular so i thought it would not be that bad , but it was pretty freaking bad .
No dr. pepper bbq and one of the apps .
Do n't even care , i 'm starving right now .
I got the korean bbq x sweet chili thai which was nothing in terms of heat , and i can not really handle my spice , so it really should have been closer to the top of the list .
The poutines / fries were so not worth the price , as you get a handful of fries and a couple teaspoons of toppings .
I am not coming back .
In over 20 years i can not think of a single bad experience with the place , other than the long wait which i will forgive because it 's totally worth it .
I can not believe i am the first to review !
The reason i am writing this review is because when i returned last weekend i was near ready to order something when i saw what the person in front of me got - and my eyes could not comprehend such beauty .
I need to go back very soon ... which my waistline will not appreciate .
The temperature is never level .
Never again .
I have been coming here once in awhile since the opening and have never been disappointed .
Found some grit , hopefully this is a one off as they are normally not gritty .
I am a big fan of the ny style pizza and benny 's does not disappoint and the jumbo slices are so awesome .
The smoothies here were really good too , used a little more mango powder than other places , but that is not a bad thing .
I ordered stir - fried vegetables once and did not enjoy them at all .
I was nervous because i had never had a colonic before , but the therapists were calm and walked me through the whole progress .
Really did not appreciate .
The cashier did not even apologize for her behaviour .
But i never would have known of the bad service people speak of in their reviews because the waitress handling our table was attentive and polite as well .
The rep gave me this look and an attitude like i did not know what i was talking about and pushed for a water treatment for dehydration .
I kept saying i did not think poofy needed it and he again kept pushing it .
Which i 'd like to point out this man is not even the actual vet .
This was something i have never seen him do before in my life , even when he was half dying they year before !
I then ask her about why he kept opening his mouth and told her he was not doing that before they took him in for the water treatment .
If you value your pets life do not bring them here !
I would not even call that person human !
I am not sure i actually got the deep conditioning treatment unless you just consider that putting conditioner in my hair and not letting it sit for any amount of time ... who knows !?!
I feel like they tried to rush me since i was using a coupon ... might be that way with everyone , not sure .
My hair looked good after the blowout , but again felt rushed and that i did not get my entire treatment .
It was friday night around 6:45 and i could not believe it was completely empty !!
Not one person in the restaurant .
I may go back to this restaurant , but will never use that restroom again .
The tables were not cleaned .
I told her while leaving that they should have just told me at 10:20 pm ( when i arrived ) that they are not taking orders .
I have lived here for 6 years and still have not been able to use this range .
The bolani was undercooked and had absolutely no filling in it like none whatsoever .
The barg kabab was also not cooked all the way through that we only found out when we got home and ate some .
Definitely will not be going back .
I might have given it another chance if it was not for that other lady and her recent experience .
They told me if i left some food on my plate the would penalize me by charging me more money on the things i did not eat .
But it was very strict i could not even give my friends a piece of the sushi .
I honestly was not originally intrigued by benny fierro 's because i thought it was a little much to have these massive slices exist and i did not really believe they would be as amazing as they are !
I felt compelled to give it a go and i have zero regrets , aside from not going sooner !
The sauce is not overly sweet and the toppings are all so good !
There is no temptation to grab a beer with your slice and up the bill ten-fold .
He did not have to do that and it really made an impression on us .
Second the lamb chops were not even cooked medium they were medium well and too hard to chew and it s just tasted awful and dry .
Will not be back except for the barg kabab that they have .
Positive : excellent food fast service ( not a lot of rush , promptly seated and order was brought out quickly ) great decor and ambience negative hostess does not speak / understand english very well , result being in lack of communication which can be bad - a few slips ups but negligible
So i recently had food here and from the outside it looks dead and not appealing however as soon as you walk in .
Not to mention - they have a korean beef bbq dish !
I ask how much longer i have to wait for it and i flat out get told i did not order a drink .
The register was not printing receipts so i was about to open my app as proof .
I am almost never in north las vegas , but i had a meeting for work that just happened to be not too far from this starbucks .
Well yes to an extent ... one of the things that was a little frustrating with this particular visit was a few items i ordered ahead of time were not actually available .
With all the money starbucks makes , they have to figure something out in the it department with this application that will not allow customers to order things that are either sold out or out of stock .
Currently that feature is available however not on all items ... other than that little bump in the road this was an okay visit with decent customer service !.
Was blown away by service - which is not a small feat when you were just picking up food !
The only downside for me , and it was a complete personal taste thing , is that i do not like that much cheese on my pizza and prefer slightly thinner crust .
My standards for turkish cuisine are high but even the ingredients in this case were either old or not well chosen .
For those not accustomed to turkish food , this place can still be your introduction .
No " visit fee " added .
She even let me know my baby is super cuddly ( which i know ) but that just shows me they do not just shove my baby into a cage and ignore him .
We decided to go here on a whim , and now we can not stop going back .
Meh ..... it was not horrible but it was not good .
Do not think i will be back .
Service was not bad but was not anything special .
I can not support a business who has such a ridiculous no exception policy .
Who does not love chocolate chip pancakes ?
The food and drinks .... well , it 's starbucks , so it 's no different than any other location .
If i was not looking carefully , i probably just skipped this place .
Not really visual .
If your order was messed up maybe it was someone being trained or you went in to the drive - thru it s going to happen do not cry just inform them they messed up on the order they will be happy to make your order right .
I have tasted afghan food at other places and i have always liked the kebab and rice , so i knew this would be good , i was not wrong !
It tries to be fancy with the chandeliers but it does not work .
This was a great place to have lunch ( it was a weekday , so it was not too loud or crazy ) .
Our waitress shifted sides of the table to take orders because she could not here people those at the other end of the table when ordering or their questions .
I mentioned it to our waitress and she said she would look for some without the cracks but most were cracked but did not leak and she would do her best .
You will not be disappointed .
I did not have high expectations of the food because many people said it sucked but to its defence , it was actually not horrible !
Though the food was your typical brunch items and nothing special , they did not screw anything up !
The waiter did not even know the price of a mimosa !
I was really scared and not to be completely graphic but ya ...
I am glad i went there a 0 expectations because i would hv not gone .
Idk it is not pleasant if you do not love taking a poo .
But there 's no shame in taking care of yourself and it 's a normal human action .
One time , we arrived around 5 on a weekday hoping to get in an early dinner , but was told there would be an hour wait ( for the near - empty restaurant ) because the tables were reserved - even though no one was there or waiting for tables !
Some of the wait staff are polite and at tentative , while others are oblivious and rude ( ex . having to flag them down every time for a tea refill or to take orders , not saying thank you after you have paid and tipped ) .
Unfortunately i was very disappointed because i did not get what i paid for .
My hair did not feel smooth and blown out .
I called the manager and explained what happened and how i was disappointed , not only did i receive an " i am sorry " but he invited me to come back and give him another chance .
At first i rated this place a 1 star but once brice spoke to me and shown true concern and compassion about how the business is ran , i changed it to a 5 star . this place will not disappoint because brice is there to make sure customers leave happy .
I can not think of anything i do not like about this range .
They do not seem to have a whole lot else .
If you do not want to wait for great coffee , you can always hit the gas station !
Can never go wrong with the chapati kabob , order it on your next visit !
The three times i have been there i have not been disappointed , but like most breakfast joints if you do nt like your homefries raw ask for them to be well done .
Just enough to flavor but not drown out the other ingredients !
The fish has always been really fresh ( never had frozen sushi , like i have had at yangs and other places ) , a good ( average ) selection of rolls , sashimi and grilled food but best of all , they serve soft shell crab by the plate !
That 's right people , by the plate , no limits , all you can eat deep fried softshell crab goodness :) prices have come down since wasabi opened up next door , so it 's now your average ayce price of about $ 22 on weekend nights .
I have had to use colonics over the year and while no one loves them - do they ?
The gyro was slightly crispy and the chicken was just right , not dry or overcooked .
Great service , modern decor , fantastic sushi , what 's not to love ?!
Can not wait to come back here again !
Pro-tip : do not be dissuaded by the $ 5ish slice prices , these slices are huge and totally worth it .
We will absolutely not be returning .
Food their entire menu was mediocre , not to mention quite expensive .
They do not have the traditional portions and selection sizes for main courses , but instead have a variety of skewers , which are ridiculously steep in price for what you actually get .
All had about 4 - 5 pieces per skewer , and did not come with any sides .
Some may assume that the price reflect the flavour or quality , but i can assure you that those prices do not justify what is being put on your plate .
Service the service was the worst part of the experience , and the main reason why we will not be coming back to this restaurant ( and possibly the bisha hotel , altogether ) .
All in all , we will not be coming back .
Save your money and experience , especially if you are thinking of going for a special occasion , celebrating it at this restaurant would not be advisable as it might just ruin your day .
So comes the day when she can step out to get her hair done for the baptism , but it must be close enough that she does not waste her time on the drive .
It 's not very easy to find .
It had so much flavour and it was actually spicy , unlike bamiyan 's hot sauce ( which is not even what i would consider mild anymore ) .
I personally would not order it again , but only because there is one spice in there that i can not stand , but it is present in quite a few indian dishes as well .
I could not even finish it all the 2nd day .
We did wait quite a while for the food , but i did not mind , as long as the food was being prepared fresh .
I never expected anyone to pay the deductible or anything along those lines .
The issue was the things that were broken only after i got the car back , and i did not have time to wait for them to fix it that same day .
When i did have time , the service tech that helped me and told me it would be taken care of , did not work there anymore and had not noted the account , and when contacted of course he did not remember .
I am pretty sure that my buttermilk pancakes , potatoe pancakes , eggs , and sausage links were not cooked enough .
Fantastic pizza , altho they cover the toppings in cheese which i do not prefer , but it 's not a big issue .
We live around the corner so it 's convenient for pickup , we have not used the delivery service .
It 's pricier tho , so we do not order here often .
I have never seen pizzas that huge !!!
The sausage is not your typical sausage .
It is sliced and the size of pepperoni and not crumbles .
I wish that they were not sliced so thin .
I have been treated so poorly there and each person just passes the buck even though the general manager and the parts manager who is no longer there stated the car was unsafe to drive .
The owner will not handle this situation .
The manager would not match discount tire 's price and then refused to service me at his dealership over the phone .
I even went as far and recorded all conversations with the general manager , parts manager and the intake person which all agreed that the problem can not be fixed and deemed it a lemon but no one will do anything about it .
It 's unsafe and they will not replace my car or settle with me .
George salman did not behave as a professional that has been in the business .
Both times my tires became flat no warn ing light came on and just the other night the infotainment system went out during my drive home late at night with 2 small boys .
George salman and matt the parts manager stated the car was unsafe and most likely could not be resolved .
I have not ever been treated with such poor customer service like this man treated me with witnesses .
He made it so difficult when i was sold a car that should not have been sold .
He had no idea how to handle the situation and george salman disparaged his own company that he works for .
However , that is not the case with benny 's !
I am finding that there are not a lot of korean food options .
I really had a craving for galbi ( beef shortribs ) and there is not a lunch option - just the dinner size .
The texture was not for me but it was still tasty .
Not for this location but the location in the smith 's on centennial and losee location since they do have a location mark there .
It 's not the staff 's fault , they are actually pretty good and i always wonder how a coffee artist at a starbucks deals with all of us grouchy customers before we had our first cup .
It 's not the actual establishment .
No drive thru , but at least i am in and out .
Hot beverages were missing sleeves , there were not enough straws for cold beverages , and one colleague received a poorly made chai that resembled lemonade and had a terrible taste .
The lines both inside and out at drive - thru are ridiculously long and are not worth the wait .
She has a soothing way about her that does not make me feel embarrassed .
I love their products as well and after her recommendations there are a few i do not want to live without !
( he 's insisting there were walnuts but i do not see such a dish on their menu whilst checking online ) he really enjoyed them , but i did think they were a little too sweet for my taste .
Not only is it right next door to denny's ( say what you will about their food ) but it 's right down the road from gab n eat and barb 's .
The difficult parking lot , that is always full , would definitely sway me to pick gab n eat or barb 's - especially if i was not in the mood for pancakes .
Unfortunately , the flavor of the pizza does not measure up to the size .
The crust was not very crispy .
The tomato sauce did not have much flavor , and the cheese was not as savory as i like .
I am appreciative that the trip is back on , just wish we had not experienced the additional stress .
Lone mountain is not my normal veterinarian so i do not know their hours , which is the reason i called the day before to make sure i knew everything i needed to know for a successful boarding experience for my pup .
Guess what , no one was there .
I used to go to banfield and we were never satisfied with them as they had long waits even though we made appointments & everything seemed overpriced .
There 's no outlet behind the hospital because the smog check blocks it off from the street .
Even though the parking lot is bad , it will not stop me from coming to this hospital .
Not a disappointment .
The only reason i give this a three star and not a 5 star is dr sparks .
I like this place but i do not like dr sparks .
No bedside manor , so to speak .
I do not know what he got or if he got his shots .
So i went here again a few weeks back and realized i was not fair .
You probably will not recognize the name benny fierro 's because each location that they open is given its own specific generic italian mobster last name .
When you walk in the door you are greeted by a really hilarious mixture of bad art motifs ... on one side there is a huge mural or what if i can remember correctly was some kind of crazy animal , i an not sure if the mural is unfinished or just bad .
There is no menu because benny only offers pizza ... which only comes in one size ... which is comically over-sized .... cut in 8 ..... which costs 30 dollars for a cheese pie .
The middle of the pies are so paper thin that the dough can not really hold the toppings so you end up pretty much being forced to eat the pizza with a fork and knife or to fold it in half .
The crust of the pies are super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat ... i almost did not eat the crust , which is usually one of my favorite parts of a pizza .
The cheese distribution on the pie would be perfect if the middle was not as thin , the cheese was evenly distributed and pulled all the way to the edge of the crust .
If they did not insist on having such a puffy crust than they could flatten it a bit and actually have a bottom thick enough to support everything .
I am not sure if they are using shortening , butter , lard or what but it definitely is a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here .
The dough has a somewhat medium density , not too dense but definitely lacking the fermentation to make it nice and bubbly .
I would be super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick but i can not imagine anyone that works there being able to slide a pie that large off of a peel ( or a peel that big even existing ) .
It 's not an offensive amount of garlic i just wish that i could taste the tomatoes more .
In general this pizza is still pretty good by the standards of this city and i will probably continue to eat a slice here once in a while but overall the pizza is not good enough to justify it s own ridiculousness .
Pizza is supposed to be easy , convenient and cheap ... you are not supposed to have to tilt it to fit it in your front door , somewhere along the way benny lemonjello forgot that .
The menu would make it seem they have no interest in selling pizzas to families or businesses , only to drunks .
I got my leased car from here because i was not sure i wanted to commit to mazda for full ownership .
With that said , i am not satisfied with the medical treatment from the veterinarian .
My german shepherd is a very submissive dog to everyone , and i have never had a complaint about him , so i was told that his ear could not be flushed last week or this week because he was resisting treatment .
I did not notice his ears to be wet last time and i even asked if his ears were actually cleaned .
To put it simply , i believe that i have been charged for treatment that was not actually applied and their story is not consistent with charges on my receipt .
So , i get that this is sort of a " concept " joint , with the biggest slices i have ever seen , but i do not care !
The sauce is what i would say is traditional - not sweet or too packed with herbs .
A nice layer is added to the za , deff not overwhelmingly saucy .
Unlike some shops , they do not chuck on a lot .
Bubbled nicely , not too greasy .
I am embarrassed to say i could not finish the whole slice !
This is not my usual veterinary hospital , so i was a bit nervous about experimenting with a new place .
Coming from california , i was not sure if vua could compare to some of the authentic asian food featured in california .
But , not to worry : all the cashiers speak excellent english !
Who does not want starbucks on fridays .
I biked with " newspaper photographer " and was looking for a tasty eat that would not be heavy on my stomach .
Not spicy at all thank goodness !
They are safety conscious and do not mind helping novice shooters - and they do it all with a very friendly , warm , and congenial demeanor .
Seriously i think she needs to find a way of dealing with the stress of her job and not venting it out on every one at the range .
The last time i went , the rifles did not have to be in a case , if yours was not they had a loaner for you to use and it was no problem .
I arrived this time sans case and they lady that took my $ 7.00 said the same thing she said last time " no problem .
If they are having internal communication issues , that 's their problem and i should never be the wiser .
I have been to some of the best japanese spots nearby and this is not one .
Absolutely no pressure from the sales team .
There was no bullshit from the get go , and all parties walked away happy .
But she was a very kind women , and i understand the struggle of a rush on a saturday morning , so i will not hold it against her .
She always talks me through my maintenance plan , never pressures me for services that are not specifically needed and truly looks out for me and what i need .
It is so refreshing to have someone who knows their job , does it exceptionally well , and cares about you as a person not just trying to see how much they can add on for additional services to your vehicle .
Portion size is a lot bigger , i never regret going there all the time .
Never been here before but i would recommend coming here for lunch or a great afternoon meal .
Their prices are reasonable and no long wait times .
First and for most i do not like to be bs'ed .
My salesman never gave me a direct answer he tap dance around the subject .
When i got up there the vehicle windows were not tinted to my liking .
Instead of just saying can not do that for you .
Once i showed him the arizona law on tinting he changed his response to we do not carry that tint .
Then the finance officer had a slight little comment because i would not buy their maintenance package .
I will not recommend or return in the future to this establishment .
You will not be sorry for stopping in !
The soup was not overly salty .
The roti with goat is something i do not see too often in other vietnamese restaurants and every table seemed to order it .
Well i have been here a bunch of times and they never diappoint .
I would never have went in if it was not from a recommendation tbh .
The goat curry and roti is so good , no lie .
The portion is pretty big and even 2 ppl can not finish it .
A slice of cheese was $ 4 and pepperoni was $ 5 , which you can not beat on the south side !
Full of flavor and you will not walk away hungry ...
They also have a good selection of pops to choose from , even some i have never seen before !
The ranch was not very good but amazing pizza !
They had not made our pizzas .
The lady at the counter told us , she thought it was a prank call and did not put the order it .
I am not sure if they would have delivered had we called .
Since sushi kim 's bulgogi is sosososo bad , that really is not saying much .
Korea garden 's bulgogi actually has flavoring , sauce , and is not like eating rubber paper .
The number of side dishes at korean garden is not as plentiful as other korean restaurants that i have been to .
I can not complain about that shortcoming because in pittsburgh , the sample size of korean food is ' 2 ' . the beef short rib is a little thick .
I have only taken the food to - go , so i can not comment on the service .
Gyros , baked flat breads , pizzas , burgers , and all kinds of mediterranean fare do not disappoint .
Calamari was very good , flat bread was good as well , and the chorizo meatballs were not like your regular meatballs .
I did not buy the car from chapman mazda but they helped me in the process .
I can never finish it though .
Let me start off by saying that i do not eat meat .
We found out that they do not have veggie options available on their menu .
So i did not order anything since the person who was putting in the order was not accommodating enough to mention any other options .
We had not established a vet since we moved to the nw side of town , so i turned to yelp for a local recommendation .
I have not eaten dine in here , but went to get take out .
I just do not like the wait for the take out .
However , for me , when it comes to pizza , size matters not .
The service was friendly , the prices were a bit high ( $ 4 - $ 5 a slice ) but considering the size of each slice it 's not that bad .
If you live in brookline , look no further , this is your one stop shop for mediterranean / middle eastern quisine .
The servers might have changed because they were not that bad .
There is a time limit of 1.5 hours and they let you know when it 's " last call " so you do not get left hungry .
Also , no spoilage fees like i have seen in some places in montreal ( which deterred me from going ) not sure if that 's common in toronto .
Worst was that the girl at front who also filled our bath had a total attitude towards my friend and i. it was one of those places that does not understand the reason for a groupon is to try and get customers in your door than provide an excellent experience so they come back .
We even tipped her 20 % and she did not even look either if us in the eye .
It is a perfect combination with the house sauce and you will not be disappointed .
Their not your typical thin ones .
The mobile pickup section has me feeling like a dope for not ordering ahead .
This was a standard place not much was special about it .
No other pizza place in south side , or pittsburgh , compares to benny 's
I know it is not lone mountains fault that the diagnostics place lost it , but really .... this is not acceptable .
I know it is not lone mountains fault that the diagnostics place lost it , but really .... this is not acceptable .
These people seem really knowledgeable but i am not happy with how this experience went and i am not sure that i trust to get any other tests done here .
There was no apology or explanation as to why the order was taking so long .
The servers did not know what the hell they were doing and worst part is the people who ordered after us got their food delivered before us .
Supposedly , they give more importance to the " eat in orders " and give little to no importance to the people doing take out !
Now onto the food , nothing great , not even decent .
There was only 1 person manning the entire restaurant , not that it 's really big , but there were 5 tables at the time , so service was not the greatest either .
Although i did not buy mazda at this dealer , i received excellent service when i took my mazda there for service 10/1/16 .
Apparently , they not only did not do an alignment after rotating the tires , they did not torque the lug nuts enough and one of the wheels could have fallen off !!
Also the fluids that big o tires said they " topped off " were low enough the tech at mazda did not believe they were done !!
One of us ordered two kibbee footballs and did not know that they only got one in one order .
Not to mention the store itself ; i have not seen it in years and they have since fixed it up and added a café .
Friendly , attentive service , and decent quality fish ( for charlotte - not exactly the ideal supply source for sushi grade fish ) .
The food was 4 stars but the service was a 2 . this was not the first time i have had bad service .
If the bacon was not so thick and good i would never go back .
I am not a banh mi expert but i really enjoyed my roasted chicken sandwich and bubble tea .
I think my tea cost more than my sandwich ( cheap sandwich , not expensive tea ) .
I m not sure what patty o is crying about in their 1 star review .
Not happening .
And do not let a range safety catch you doing something fubar .. man they will chew you out !
Ok , the building is small and the parking limited and my order was not made right the first time but gladly redone and so by being starbucks and the service friendly they get the four stars .
We are big and of the sardari kabob meal ( chicken ) and the house special - kandahar kabob ( meat and comes with grilled vegetables ) ordering takeout can be a challenge as it 's busy for them and they never came seem to hear despite yelling into the phone - but the meal is worth it .
When i arrived i was met by an extremely rude woman who declared i did not get a confirmation so i had no appointment .
She did not look to see if there was anything later that day or the next or apologize for the glitz in booking .
When i decline those services , she becomes short and does not want to answer any questions or offer any information .
Her assistant told the clerk not to charge for the exam ( $ 50 ) , but dr. eisenmann insisted .
She 's in it for the money and does not understand customer service .
I will not be going back there anymore .
This review is a bit biased , as i did not have any food .
She assured me that she would get all the records from craig animal hospital and that it would be no problem checking the dogs in quickly and getting out in order to get to the airport on time .
When we arrived on the day of our flight the staff there wanted us to wait around in order for a vet to examine one of our dogs because the shots were not updated .
I explained what jennifer had told me and also of my offer to come in days prior to get this taken care of and they told me they had no idea .
When we came back from our trip we noticed several billing errors one they charge for physical exams on two dogs that were already done at the criag clinic they also gave a dog a rabies shot he did not need which once again was taking care of at the craig clinic apparently no one at lone mountain called over to craig or there was a miscommunicationand we ended up paying extra money for services we did not need .
To date , i have not heard nothing from lone mountain animal clinic .
If u feel sluggish , not yourself , and no joke , have back problems this place will make a huge difference .
Worth every penny and the staff is so nice and so helpful . the location is a bit hidden if u do not know the area , but if u call , the staff is happy to direct you .
My review is for a take - out order , so this is more about the food - not so much the service .
One this that i did not like were the tomatoes .
I could not eat more than 2 slices because it was just that packed .
But the dish was so awful i thanked them quickly and had to run out for plan b meal cuz i just can not stomach the food .
Not only that , but it was sooo hot inside , and the ac was not turned on .
Overall , i had a terrible experience and would not recommend this place .
Food quality is not good .
I found the tuna to be nice and fresh , no fishy smell or taste , and all the sides were just as fresh .
I also felt they gave a really good amount of protein , so much in fact i did not even finish it all and i got the smallest size .
The service was great and never missed a brat , but did not over crowd us at the same time .
Just purchased my first mazda over the weekend and could not feel better about it .
Michael was helpful , fun , professional , and the price we agreed to is the price i paid ; no surprises in the financing office .
I would never ever go back to this place .. the rangers there are on power trips and are extremely rude .... i know safety is important but they abuse that fact and use it to pump up their own egos and take their personal frustrations out on the customers ... my advice go out in the far desert and shoot .
I promise i will not shoot anyone !
So yeah , not everything was traditional or " authentic " greek , but it was all very good and the variety was fun .
Their cheese is amazing and they really pile on the toppings so if you are not used to it or it 's not your thing then try to be minimal with your topping selection .
I learned not to order ground beef on my pizza because it 's just too much but i really enjoy a simple pizza from them because the ingredients are fresh and tasty .
Once i accidentally received this pizza as mine was mixed up with another person 's order but i got ta say it was amazing and i never would have ordered something like this myself , so thank you !
If you thought that was bad , let 's not even begin with the customer service here .
Will never be coming back .
Ordered a mixed grill plate and was not disappointed .
There 's been some changes the last several years but i can not ascertain .
No love for my sandwich at all ( t_t ) i also always get 3 basil drinks ( buy 2 get 1 free ) they are like bubble tea but healthier !
I could not drink it .
We asked what about putting 2 tables together outside and was told " we never do that " .
When is it up to the servers and not the customers ?
This is not the only place to go to downtown .
I was happy to find a place that had healthy food ( not to me tips delicious green food in particular ) open at 9 am .
We were not disappointed .
We could not stop eating it .
My only complaint , and it 's really not that big of a deal , is that i wish they were open a little bit later .
This place is not only a brookline gem , but a pittsburgh gem .
You will not be disappointed .
I have not had a korean food for such a long time since my last visit at sushi kim , which i swear never to go back again .
If you are looking to get a quick bite - then this may not be the ideal place to get one .
Tried this place three times and every time i said i am not coming back .
Falafels were very bland and just not right .
First experience , i said maybe the cooks had a bad day but it can not be that they had a bad day everyday .
It 's really not difficult to make a delicious falafel or chicken sandwich .
Service and staff here are slow and not the friendliest .
Only reason i did not rate it 5 - star was that the ambiance could be better .
Those slices ai not got nothing on the size of a virginia slice .
No joke , it 's enormous .
You 'd think pies this big would not be cooke properly and may be raw / doughy .
Not the case .
The one thing the last time i was there there that was rather annoying especially since it was my birthday was that both my husband and i wasted avocado on our bowls and they did not have anymore prepared on friday night ready for customer and we would have had to wait 10 minutes which lets be be for real by the size of the container it would have been longer then 10 minutes which goes back to why are you not top of your food prep when all your food is raw !
I just prepare myself that they will not have all the yummy stuff i love and when they do it 's a bonus .
But to be truly honest the only issue i have ever had was the avocado and they had it it was just not prepared .
I know my husband is not feeling well if he is considering getting a colonics treatment .
I am usually the one who does all of the crazy things in our household and i could not believe he was beating me to this one but rather glad so that i could hear all about it .
Was not expecting such an eye opening experience , but i did at healing waters .
She is outwardly rude to customers and seems to gain pleasure by being so .... we left a 30 % cash tip for our waitress the other day ... she thought it was her place to advise me that i was " required " to tip on my credit card at minimum of 15 % ... not her place to tell me how much or that a tip was required .
A tip is a courtesy , not a requirement .
She took a 5 star experience and dropped it to a 3 ... had our service been off or the food not as good , she could have lost you good customers .
Do not be fooled by the exterior or neighborhood .
Went to osaka for my birthday this year and i have been twice before i was not impressed but my family told me to go try it again so i took a leap and i am glad i did .
My friends got sushi , i did not so i will not comment on it other than to say they enjoyed it and it was pretty .
Targets are not too badly priced either and the range officers keep it orderly .
No matter how good the food they make , is no way you could finish .
Anyway , i will not back there for sure .
Why is this not a franchise ?
In fact , it 's so good that even if i am not hungry , i will pick up a couple of sandwiches from here whenever i am in the neighbourhood , just so that i can have them for later .
I was not expecting the world coming to this restaurant but our server tamara was exceptional .
We were a large group ( 9 ) of ladies out for our friend 's birthday and not the easiest group to deal with .
Me and my wife have not been out in a while and were so impressed with service and selection !
This place seems to have the best banh mi in ville - marie and is on par with the average ( not exceptional ) places you 'd find in california .
I liked my falafal wrap , but i have to admit it was not the best i have eaten .
I have heard so much about this place and could not wait to try this apparently amazing and fresh pita that seems to be the usp of pitaland , but it was not to be this time .
Do not miss the arabic coffee when you are there .. oh and their dips are all pretty awesome !
The server did not even know how to carry plates or serve
It s so cheap i could not believe my eyes .
I left a tip on the table but the waitress / owner did not see it and loudly told us in front of all the customers that we forgot to leave a tip .
It was embarrassing and they should not have done that .
Even if we did not leave a tip , they should have swallowed that and kept their mouth shut over a tip .
Now , i will never go back to that restaurant over that experience and it 's not worth losing a customer over a tip .
I 'd passed by this place a few times before but have never actually eaten here until this week .
There was a lot more rice than chicken and it just did not look very satisfying .
Taste wise , the curry was all right , but not blow - your - socks - off amazing .
The roti was crispier and less doughy than what i am used to , but it was not bad .
I did not get a chance to try the chicken rice .
I also ordered a three colour drink and it was not terrible but it was not good either .
All in all , this would not be my first choice to eat at , but it would not be my last either .
Ridiculous large 30 " pizza ny style , can not be beat .
Can not wait to go back , again and again !
There 's no reason for me to come back here .
Not many vets will examine a tree frog and even less know as much as dr.
It do not forget to leave room for desert and the delightful tres leches .
I have a favorite sushi spot in town but they do not have the hibachi plate type i love to each ( non- bento ) .
No description about those pieces included from the menu .
The steak and veggies were totally not seasoned .
Just cooked with oil and looked like pepper but no pepper flavor .
No smell of flavoring and quite a bit of water in my plate .
My cat who always stares and begs for food did not want the piece of steak i gave him .
Apparently they do not open until 12:00 .
No one greeted us , and i had to ask if they were open .
The young girl working told us they were not open until 12 .
No welcome and / or have a seat and we will serve you when everything is ready .
We were sitting down the whole time , and not one employee let us know they were ready for us to order .
I was not sure about osaka , but decided to give it a shot one lunch hour about four months ago - i am really glad that i did !
The sushi is fresh and expertly rolled - it does not fall apart .
I usually get the sushi and sashimi bento box , it runs about $ 11 and comes with salad and soup , and more than enough sushi and sashimi - i have never gone away hungry and more than once have been unable to finish it all !
The service is decent , it 's never been bad .
I can not wait to bring my family back who have not been shooting before !
I gave it 4 out of 5 due to the fact their greek fries are just the regular fries topped with cheese with no other seasoning .
No hassle !
Has not changed one bit !
I never felt pressured .
And no english !
If i am not going to the desert i am coming here for sure .
Not only is this place great quantity value for your money ( especially on the super cheap lunch specials ) but the food is high quality and delicious .
The sushi , hibachi , and everything in between are all 10/10 , and there 's nothing on the whole list of appetizers that i have not liked .
Service is fast as well , and as long as the restaurant is not packed and your party is not enormous , you will frequently get your food before you have finished your soup and salad .
My favorite korean place in pittsburgh , the food is delicious , decent service for a korean place ( i.e. korean restuarant are not known for their services ) .
And the staff purposely said was because we did not give tips so i could hear their conversation , hinting for us to give tips .
When we got home .... we realized the chicken was not very fresh and the vegetable dish we order was so tiny in terms of portion .....
I will not let any one else dry my hair :)
I work close by and sometimes when i do not bring my lunch , this is a good option for cheap lunch .
They also have vegetarian sandwich and spring rolls for those who do not eat meat .
We do not have a lot of vietnamese sandwich places in mtl , but this place is fun and has tons of choices ...
No one ever came to ask us how the meal was and it took 15 minutes before we were able to even flag down anyone to get some ketchup for our now - cold fries .
When we asked for the bill , the woman ( presumably the owner ) came to collect the money , never asking us how the meal was and never even bothering to thank us .
No surprise the restaurant was 80 % empty .
I was not crazy about the corned beef hash .
We tried coming here a few times before and could not find a spot .
You can not beat their lunch special for both sushi and hibachi .
Found another vet that would not charge $ 100 for something i did not want and they were happy to see bullwinkle and rocky .
They will say anything to charge for services you do not need !
Did not have a reservation but got seated at the bar while we waited .
The toast was delicious and the cherry tomatoes were not too sour and a good touch .
So looks like these guys will not be the typical fly by night deli that plagues la centreville .
I always order these guys through the livery and i must say there is not one person in my home that has not complemented pizza .
Each piece of sliced must weigh at least 5 lb lol you definitely get your money 's worth from this establishment the very courteous and timely i have never had an issue with it and i know numerous people that order from this company and they are fabulous .
Aiello 's is good , but it s not great .
You will not be disappointed .
Would not recommend this specific location .
Owner would not honor the $ value of an expired groupon & did not tell me until midway through my service .
Definitely not worth the $ .
Style did not hold up through my event & was not even hot or humid
I specifically stated no dealer add - ons and that i will not sign if i see any slipped into the contract last minute .
So , they did not put them in writing but added them to my bill " coverertly " .
The first time i did not notice anything as the crowd and line up was shorter .
Not sure how hard is it for them to get the naan , sauce , drinks and salad dressing .
I mean does not take a rocket scientist to do that .
And the big no - no was when they handled the food with their bare hands and then touched everywhere in the counter and the cash register .
I mentioned several times , please do not place your finger in the food , please use a gloves or tongs , they just ignore it and continue putting their finger into everyone 's food and then use the same finger to touch the cash register and anywhere around the counter .
They have great potential but run by kids who have no idea what they are doing .
Went in today to carry out a couple of orders and this place did not disappoint .
Admittedly , he was dressed a little too casually with a backpack for his camera ( he 's a food blogger ) but i did not think it was bad enough to turn away .
We were told that they " were not accepting walk - ins " by a very rude hostess even though they seated two groups that arrived before and after us who had no reservations .
I have never been turned away from a place like this before , it was very embarrassing and because of this experience , i would never recommend it and would not plan on going back .
Chase not only did not listen to the things that we had spoke .
About like calling me with a price quote with oil change and or things that warrenty did not cover .
My tire needed to be changed because of a nail so he could not do my requested car diagnostics .
Ok well i understand the policy of mazda however i am having a hard time financially and i bought a used tire and brought it with me and because of policy again he said his manager did not .
He then ignored the go way and beyond policy you have and did not even bother to try to make a new appointment .
Which is was not .
I not only did not get my oil changed or the requested diagnostics handled in my vehicle .
I completely felt obsolete and unimportant to not only the second car i purchased with mazda but he did not understand why i was upset .
I left to get the tire hanged but did not return because i have been completely discouraged with this company not only with the service department but your core values !
I do not understand car functions but .
And totally request for more cream ( no extra charge ) .
1 of the 2 main reasons why i would not come back .
Large pino special + poutine ( 1.5/5 ) : the 2nd reason why i would not come back .
How the crust was great and overall for a mom and pop shop they did make good pizza ... but that will not make up for the food poisoning my boyfriend and i paid for after the fact .
I figure it was because pino's was understaffed and with an influx of orders they rushed and did not cook the pizza well enough .
Cost ( 3/5 ) : $ 20 for a large pizza and $ 7 for poutine + tip. not bad .
It 's not a chain , the servings were large and hearty , so i think it was fairly priced .
Do not expect anything fancy .
Can not really ask for more than that .
Overall , besides some kind of food poisoning and horrendous wait time , the pizza was not that special .
It was a nice change from chains like pizza pizza and pizza hut , but not special enough to come back for a second round .
We waited 50 minutes to be seated but we had nothing else to do , so i did not really mind and there were so many people there , i figured it would be worth the wait .
My fiance ordered a tom yum soup with no flavor and my pho tasted like regular broth from a can .
I did not expect good service and was right .
They do not accept credit cards and you have to pay at the front .
Not a place worth trying !
If i am craving poke , i would go here , but not all the time .
I was not at all impressed with this place .
Not 1 single person other than the waiter .
When we told him , he corrected it , but i was not please about that error .
All the dishes were bland , dry , and just not satisfying at all .
While it was not the cornwall pizza i grew up with .
Their location is not really something you will stumble across , so yelp was a big help to draw us there .
Could not tell you about their whole menu .
Staff do not waste any time .
I feel so much cleaner and have not had any more digestive problems since .
I ordered a large 3 topping with wings special and i was so disappointed they did not even start making my wings until i got there 30 + minutes later .
I did not drive out there to get a very cold pizza ; it is really unacceptable they did not have the wings started when while there was traffic they were not busy .
When i got home they actually put too much cheese on ( and i love cheese ) so much so the pizza did not cook properly and the brick of cheese on top fell off when u try to eat it and topping were cold .
The mistake was so bad i really can not justify going out there if they can not serve hot food or get a simple order ready in reasonable time .
I will not be back
Definately the best korean place in pittsburgh i know of ... although that 's not saying much .
Drinks are damn expensive and the food is ok for the price , but there 's not really any other option out here .
Everything about this place is awesome except for one thing - their washrooms are not clean and not maintained well .
If you have spent any amount of time in the adams morgan district of washington , d.c. ( or anywhere in va , really ) then this is not a new concept .
While not my favorite pizza in da ' burgh , it 's a true - blue go - to for late night eats .
It 's usually empty or pretty close to it , but do not let that deter you , it just means less wait !
The only reason i am not giving 5 stars is just because the weekend hours are a little inconvenient , it seems to be closed anytime we try to go to dinner here on a saturday or sunday .
When i first saw the size of a slice of pizza at benny fiero 's , i assumed it was just a gimmick and the pizza would not be very good .
I ordered delivery from bf 's once and the pizza box was so large that i had to angle it to get it to fit through my front door ! for $ 30 - 35 you can feed 4 - 6 people which is not too bad and it 's fun to eat such an enormous slice .
If you have not tried turkish before , try pasha out .
Up until this weekend , i had never even used a shotgun and now here i am the first to review the ben avery shooting range .
My husband recently acquired not one , but two guns - a shotgun and a pistol - much to my dismay .
I had passed by the place a hundred times on my way to the lake but had never stopped .
Earplugs are necessary and noise canceling headphones could not hurt .
We did not end up staying at this area because we had come for clay shooting and i can not say i was disappointed to get out of there .
I can not say this is a new hobby of mine , but i will be back every now and then to freshen up and practice .
Not returning to this place .
One of the guys that works there suggested the beef shawarma but it was not as i expected , the beef was chewy .
Chicken shawarma was good , but you have to buy a side it does not come with fries or anything .
Service was attentive and the waiters never rushed us through our meal .
The bread on the avocado toast could have been slightly toasted a bit more but it was not difficult to cut which was great .
Wife has tried the sushi and was not thrilled but said it was not bad .
Not much to choose in the area so just glad there is one close by to drive to .
Interior is a little bland and never seems busy so we will probably stick to take out .
We do not typically care which vet we see bc they are all nice .
I was bummed out that a few of the lamb dishes were not available , but what we ordered was still very good .
I can not remember the name of all the dishes , but we ordered the zucchini pancake , shepards salad , the turkish style lamb gnocchi and the amazing desert that has ice cream and cheese .
Not as much fun as shopping at whole foods or east end food coop .
The service , however , is not always on par .
I have not frequented it enough to say i am a regular or to justify that the service is always like this ... but when i have gone , they do not seem to be very efficient .
They did not take names for orders , so when it came to picking them up , there was a slight confusion .
It also does not help when the person calling out the order is soft spoken and you could not hear them in the first place .
I have never gone through the drive thru at this location , so i can not vouch or comment on that .
Undercooked falafel , over processed babaganoush , gyro salad oily with no flavor , and terrible service .
Do not miss out this place works as a grocery store and a cafe .. and believe me when i say the have amazing food here ..
I do not think you can go wrong here .
The food is good , not great but good .
They have 3 veggie options but the veggie mantoo and that potato folles bread is never available .
I would never go out of my way to go here .
Although prince sushi does not look like much from the outside , the ( tiny ) interior is very nice if a little cramped .
Our group did not do ayce for lunch ( not sure if it 's available during the week ? ) .
Not expensive and very fresh !
This is a real 5 star review from someone not affiliated with pitaland .
Not only that , the service was impeccable .
We will be back , i will not be surprised if we are here multiple times a week !!!
I tried " beyti kebab " and as the desert " künefe with ice cream " on the top and i can only say that if you have not had that experience , i suggest you to come by and add new tastes into your lives .
They have great lunch and sushi deals during the week as well so it does not break the bank .
I am giving them 5 stars because i loved the crazy salmon roll and my hibachi chicken was not dry .
Good old pizza made almost montreal style never had a bad pizza from there been around forever delivery service is reliable decent sized menu .
Staff were friendly enough very busy kitchen no time to really chat with customers
When they screwed up our order , they did not even make the drinks correctly the second time .
I felt myself tighten but she rubbed my stomach and helped me relax as i filled till i could not take it any more .
I can not wait to go back !.
Try this place out you will not be disappointed .
Even that , the price was not too bad .
Coffee machine needs to be calibrated , different members of the family at different times have experienced " milky " drinks because this location and the one on mlk uses a different setup or needs to service their machines .. we want coffee not hot milk !
Granted , it would be unfair to compare a korean restaurant in pittsburgh with those in these cities , i can not help but be a bit disappointed .
Not much seafood and bland soup base .
Korea garden does the job if i do not have time to cook and am having a serious korean food craving .
Not my go - to choice when it comes to cuisine , but the restaurant we wanted to come to was super full with a long wait , so we came here instead .
Probably not my top pick to come for a meal , but would not mind coming back if no other choices were given .
If it were not for occasional attitudes i have gotten here and there i 'd probably be giving a 5 star review .
I had an issue 2 times ago where i had a deal chicken i had bought just 2 days before ( and clearly not used yet ) but since she was not finding it on her end ( even with my voucher and clearly no appointments since i had bought it ) .
The front desk girl was very rude and insisted she hold a credit card to charge if they did not ' find ' my deal chicken on their end with the only answer for me who had paid for the deal chicken being to check my credit card statement and if they charged me then call & take it up with deal chicken .
Sorry , but in my opinion that 's something they should have been doing as i clearly had paid for the deal chicken and never used it .
Last time i we nt i got a complimentary blow out with a new stylist in training so you absolutely can not beat that .
This is the first gf meal i have had with a " bread - y " component ( pancakes ) that did not make me miss the real thing .
They were better than the not gf kind .
I am a recent convert to the poke life and can not get enough .
This place is tucked away and does not look incredibly exciting , but a total gem . the staff was really friendly and the food was fresh and delicious . this plus the proximity to my house is going to get it into the regular rotation .
They lie take ur money and then when they are wrong do not do anything about it .. let my dog suffer for months because their doctors got no experience !!!
They lie take ur money and then when they are wrong do not do anything about it .. let my dog suffer for months because their doctors got no experience !!!
What ever u do do not ever go there !!!
The salon is gorgeous , and a great idea that they also offer makeup services ... why are not other blow dry bars offering that !
Can not wait to go back and sample more goodies !
I never have to wait & all the stylists are very , very friendly .
I do not understand why some comments say anything negative about the staff ... that must have been " old " staff .
Stylists do not push products on you ... which i love .
I do not have much experience with other sporting clay facilities , but this one has , probably , everything that i would want .
Solid mix of throws and it seems like no two stations are alike .
The service was very bad ; he messed up our order and question us if we have ever made that order ; 2 ) he was not patient , he ignored us and ask us not to wave him . he will come to take our order paper 3 ) ( the third one may not related to him ) he not allowed us to order 6 ice cream for 5 ppls , we were like what ?

Salmon was alright , nothing spectacular and had no sides .
The for 2 portion is actually for one person unless you do not eat much .
It can get busy so do not show up at the dinner hour and expect to sit immediately .
In addition , i had to call for a menu because my baby just fell asleep and i did not want to wake her up .
I actually was not thinking during a cease fire and just walked to the table to put my ear phones down and they were on the loud speaker in less than a second explaining that rule out loud .
They also did it in a way that i was not pointed out and chastised for being the one who messed up .
I guess what i am saying is that you can tell that safety is their number one concern there , but they do it in a manner that does not make you feel uncomfortable .
I think this helps when it comes to safety because the shooter ( especially a beginner ) does not feel all flustered worrying about being pointed out for doing something wrong and can focus on the task at hand , and doing it right .
They even have a 1,000 yard range , but you might want to call them about that one before you go because i did not see anyone over there when we were there .
The place does not look very posh from the outside so a city folk may be hesitant to walk in .
The location is a bit odd but since i was introduced to it by a local , i have been introducing it to plenty of other people who do not even live in the area .
But do not eat with your eyes !
I typically can not finish off a personal calzone and if i do , i am out cold afterwards .
If you are not a sushi person go for the chicken fried rice ( with extra sauce just trust me ; ) .
The service is slower than average and the ambiance is not much to see , but the food is still pretty good .
Can not get enough of this place !
I do not usually wear a ton of makeup - and i usually stick with neutral tones and an " office conservative / natural " look .
I told her i was going to a party , and am open to new styles - so something a bit bolder than normal , but not quite clown - school level was the goal .
I was not unhappy with any aspect , and in the case with the assistant bringing a fresh drink and munchies , i was impressed and felt that went above what was expected .
I do not know what i was expecting , i do not know what could have been differently or better - i really did have a good experience .
But for some reason , i am not tempted to shout from the rooftops that this is the best place ever - or even worth driving to if you do not live in the ne valley .
If i had a hot date at pure sushi ( next door ) , i may make an appointment to go in a couple hours early and get dolled up - but super- savings deal or not , it 's really not worth a 30 minute drive each way .
There is no covering when you sit in their outdoor area so be cautious on sunny days as it can get a little hot .
This would not have been so terrible if the bread was not hard and dry .
You never enjoy coming to a place where you feel like you are inconveniencing the staff .
I took a parcel to eat it next day , but did not feel like it as the taste was okay at best .
I would understand maybe they all got sick or something i am not sure , but they were not of help in trying to reschedule .
They offered me one other day " which i said i could not make because of the short notice " and they then were like well just call and reschedule .
Maybe i am expecting more because i am in customer service , but if it is the companies fault that they can not honor an appointment on such short notice they should go to better lengths to provide service alternatives .
Whether that be making sure i find an appointment that fits my schedule or some sort of fee off of the service for me to come back at a later , more inconvenient time , i am not sure ( that is up to their management ) .
Could not tell you the quality of their service here but the customer service could be better .
There are no servers !
Service : can be improved , cashiers are not really that friendly .
I was not really impressed ...
The coffee they make is great however it never fails that i am on the drive thru for 10 - 15 minutes .
This is not an isolated incident .
I have never been offered one .
As a whole , the sushi was ok , not the best we have had , but ok .
They are absolutely amazing and made in - house so you know you are not only getting freshness but authenticity as well .
They also did not skimp on the other toppings which i appreciated .
First of all the guy taking sandwich orders was not following any particular order as he floated through the line and consequently skipped a few people which in turn lead to confusion at the counter .
We just happened to catch them on a bad day when the electronic system was not running very well ... difficulty with payments and ordering leading to a 35 minute wait .
Not sure all the low ratings .. you will not go wrong with shannon !
Not sure all the low ratings .. you will not go wrong with shannon !
I come here when i really crave some korean food ... but it 's not that good .
They have a karaoke room upstairs for parties which is fun , but it does cost an arm and leg since there is no other asian - karaoke options near the area .
No looking back !
I love japanese food and i know the words ayce does not represent the best of japanese food .
The service i can not fault ...
It was as if the chefs could not keep with up with the orders from the various tables and the restaurant was only at 50 % capacity .
In general , cooked items arrived hot so it was not the front of the house staff being lazy ...
In general , they were not bad .
The sushi was not great .
I can not say i would do it willingly considering there is a new ayce that is getting raves in the northern part of town ( heart sushi ) .
I do not know why i do not come here everyday .
And everything 's reasonably priced ( do not have to shell out too many leaves for my grape leaves ... ) best of all , in the last year they opened a cafe inside .
The gyro , lamb burger , french fries with rosemary dip , flat breads are all excellent and will not disappoint !
Some of the food we ordered never came .
The only that was good was that they had spider rolls which is one of my favorite that most ayce do not have .
That is of course as long as it 's not chipotle from the grayhawk location , because i will be asleep before they finish wrapping the burrito ( they are too slow ) anyhow .
I love my blowouts ... fantastic job girls , even though no one seems to like my weave .
So most of us do not like dealing with car dealerships , and i normally always call the internet department as you seem to get better service and are not subjected to the salesperson who swoops in as you walk from parking your car !!
So not a bad experience !!!
Not only is she a salesperson , she actually is a mazda zealot !!
Not only do they offer it all but the staff is amazing .
My boyfriend was not a fan of the eye makeup but it was fun .
The blonde was not as nice and really made me feel like she did not want me there .
Not impressed .
No need to be , great staff , very professional , most of all clean .
Shawarma no flavor , tabouli full of bulgar filler with almost no parsley .
No bread .
Never again !
They also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well , technically , they are not pepperoni rolls , but pita pepperoni rolls .
I have not brought one , but i sampled one and it tasted good .
So prince sushi did not used to be an ayce and a couple years ago decided to jump on the bandwagon , this is obvious by their location which is at the amc theatres plaza and is small in size with about 15 smaller tables .
I do not think that is fair at all , only sushi place to do this , as far as i know .
That 's like saying if you want 2 pieces of salmon sashimi , you have to eat 2 pieces of tomako ( egg sushi ) x_x it is probably a deterrent for people not to mass order shrimp tempuras , but some people who do not eat raw fish ( allergies / personal preferences ie some of my friends ) like shrimp tempura and do not like fried vegetables ?!?!?
The service was so very warm and hospitable -- we were well attended to , not rushed , and felt as if we were being welcomed into someone 's home .
We came on a weekday , so we did not get to experience the full menu .
The most expensive of approach includes a bunch of tests that may or may not be necessary but usually include a hefty price tag .
When you ask the assistant details about the various tests they usually can not explain them and do not know the difference .
If i was a veterinarian i would know which approach to take instead of having an assistant that is not sure about the differences between the courses of treatment ask me which one i would like to take .
I also noticed there was not much multitasking going on , making one drink at a time type thing .
So if you can not multitask well , and you are playing around , that means people are going to be late getting back to work from their break ( this girl ) .
I can not say it was bad but i would not eat there again .
If they are not busy they will even bring out some amazing appetizers on the house for your table .
The manager , fred , who makes poor judgment decisions , cut into a vehicle that was not authorized , or consented .
The vehicle was not owned by the shop , dealership , or the paid out by the insurance company .
I dropped off a drivable vehicle on 07/2018 and did not receive anything in return .
I did not a payout or anything to accommodate from the shop , or the insurance company .
Your privately owned vehicles will be tampered and further damaged and they will not be returned back to you .
I do not know what it is about this place , but the sushi is amazing .
I would compare the quality with not all you can eat places .
Just do not make the same mistake we did and order everything on the menu .
They will not toast them , though , because apparently they turn off the ovens by then .
The bread , of course , was spongy and cold but did not seem like it 'd hold up as toasted baguette either .
I have never walked out of a blow dry bar feeling uglier than when i walked in .
First , i overheard my stylist , sasha , complaining to the receptionist that she did not know i was her client .
As she never parted my hair , when she dried the few bangs she located , my bangs parted in the middle with half falling left and half falling right , looking absolutely ridiculous .
She did not know and arranged for another stylist to try to fix my bangs , who tried but my bangs were too dry to fix .
I will never go to primp and blow again .
Halibut was dry and not very flavorful .
I get they are busy but should not drinks go out in order ?
Their prices are not any higher and it 's bigger servings than other poke places too .
I am also not a huge fan of toppings under the cheese .
They had me watch a quick safety video , answer a few safety questions and off i went to trap field 7 ... it was not yet daylight so the trap field lights were on ... i shot 100 rounds and as the sun rose there was a natural transition to daylight .
It was 5 dollars and i was expecting a rather big piece , so i did not order two .
I am not sure why i did not exactly like the first time , but i have really liked their pizza since then .
It is a good balance of ingredients and it is not overly greasey , which is a pet peave of mine .
The entire pie is sooo huge i do not think i would ever need that much pizza , but they are great to stop in for a quick bite .
Plus they have really interesting soda's and teas i can not find anywhere else .
It 's not a large space , so i can see it getting really busy on weekends .
We do not live in ajax , so delivery is unfortunately not an option .
Eat in is ok - atmosphere is like a small town diner without boothes - but you go here for the pizza , not the decor .
Well , this was not " most places " .
There was enough of that perfectly cooked , not - yet - disintegrating brisket drowned in an abundance of liquid gold - the curry gravy .
Words can not describe it , you need to have that roti , tear it with your very fingers , dunk it in the curry sauce , and send it straight in your salivating mouth .
Unfortunately their freezer was not working so none of the desserts had ice cream accompanying the dessert and you can not order scoops of ice cream or sorbets . :(
I have to say despite no ice cream , the desserts we ordered tasted great .
The tres leche cake was not too sweet even though it had dulce de leche in here and the cake was very moist .
Busy to the point there was not much room to stand or sit at the bar either !
I can not emphasize enough about how busy this place gets and sometimes booking online is difficult .
Also order their ice cream or sorbets because it 's not your typical flavors you can try elsewhere .
The service was not the best , but the sushi was top notch .
Everything tasted fresh , sushi did not have excessive amount of rice unlike most other ayces places .
No matter how many times i have been there , they do not take into account of regular customers and their needs .
I have even circled around the number of orders that i want but i never end up with it .
I have had a server spill hot tea on my friend and did not really apologize ( just shocked and awed ) .
I have asked if it was possible to make a yam tempura roll seeing since they have all the ingredients but i was quickly denied with no explanation and then walked away .
The servers that have been there longer are not the nicest , but the newer ones are .
I do not go there as often , but it 's always my fall back place to go .
If you read some of my earlier reviews , not only do i love sushi , but i can also be a bit over critical on sushi restaurants .
I typically do not like your local downscale sushi joints .
At first sight , osaka is certainly not eye opening place , but it is certainly a diamond in the rough .
The restaurant was not super busy but it did have a good amount of people there .
All of them not only looked amazing but also tasted out of this world .
I am not a huge fan of cream cheese in my sushi so i was only able to eat a couple pieces of the godfather but it was really good .
Made reservation for lunch although when i got there there was not too many people and there are plenty of tables so really did not need a resrvation .
This place is a good place to host people or come for an occasion but definitely not one for daily turkish eating .
Save yourself ....... do n't buy from here .
They do not care about customer service .
No one answers the phone at this place .
They were unwilling to negotiate at all ...... not even to earn a loyal customer .
It was promised the next business day by 9 a.m. no one would take my call .
I have never been more frustrating in just trying to get a refund for a car they could not deliver ... in fact , they said that mazda did not even manufacture a white cx - 5 with black leather .
We were not let down .
If you order " as is " they understand the numbers and you really can not go wrong .
And their decor is not exactly pleasant but if you are looking for some yummy coconut based curries , you should give this a try .
The shrimp and scallop bento box was covered in mushrooms ( which were not listed on the menu but made up the majority of the dish ... not a happy surprise for someone who despises mushrooms .
At least it was not greasy but the sauce it was in was not quite what it could have been .
We will not be going back .
It is a no frills kind of place but they also seem to do a booming take out business .
You almost have to have the address to find this place because there is no big sign , only a sign on the window .
It can be a little slow inside , but i have never had them make a drink incorrectly !
No managers present to help .
Will never go back .
Their pasha mix , turkish tea and kunefe are my favorites , and service never disappoints .
Not sure what to expect when i arrived ....... but it was a lovely place .
I did not but if i am ever back i wound certainly go here again !
The people were there , friendly , not as much .
And no beverage offered .
Not even water ... some offer champagne .
The place is not small but it is not very big either so expect to line up durring normal dinner hrs , and the inside looks nice .
You can not get the soft shell crab on the lunch menu , if you could i 'd go there for lunch because it would be cheaper .
After declining the service , i paid the high diagnosis fee plus a " supplies " charge that no one could explain .
They just said " the computer adds it in and it can not be removed " .
I feel chapman mazda service just wants their diagnosis fee and does not care about customer retention .
Today when we were there the manager heard our daughter getting upset because there was no more marshmallows on the smores pancakes we ordered for her and our son to share .
They make you feel welcomed , not rushed and the food is on point .
If you get there early in the morning you will have a wait but it is never really long .
We got there at 11 am and the place was not very busy , quite and the food came out very quick .
Was not too crowded ( it was a friday morning ) .
The service is on the slow side as they are pretty understaffed for a restaurant that size , so the waiter forgets things , have to ask for water again and again and all that fluff , can not blame them , they have soo much on their plate , but i can blame the management .
Pasha dinner - is good for two people , they grill the meat perfectly but it does not really have a lot of flavour to it , and the rice that comes with does not go with the grilled meat at all , definitely need some sauce for flavouring .
The seating is not spacious but it 's not pose as a fancy restaurant .
Go for the views but do not expect professional servers beyond what you 'd find in a " 16 year old waiting tables at kelsey 's " as one of my fellow diners commented .
The service - we had to flag our server down multiple times for water refills , to ask for the wine list once starters were done , there was no inquiry as to my friends wine or to even ask if they wanted another glass !
( which they did and we went out after dinner because not enough wine is sheer travesty ) after waiting for eons for our server to come take our dessert orders we said forget it and just paid the bill .
I do not need a ipad to order thank you very much , i will take human interaction .
It was good ... not great .
When i got the wings and noticed they were not breaded , i did not expect much .
I am personally not too big on pho but this place is alright , the portions are large and the food is okay .
I would not mind coming back .
Granted , there are not many good places in pittsburgh for korean food compared to ny , but this will do .
I only come here to get the bulgogi lunch box special ( around $ 8 plus tax and tip ) , which is not a bad deal .
Sometimes , they serve you hot tea for free ( if they do not , you should just ask for it and they will give it to you ) .
They do not really give you that many side dishes though , which is surprising and disappointing ... the service is not bad , it 's usually a cute korean girl running around to serve everyone .
The restaurant is not that big , but it 's not that small either ( like oiishi ) .
I think there is a parking lot , but i have not seen it yet .
Personally , i think oiishi bento has better korean food :p but korea garden is not bad , especially for pittsburgh .
It definitely was not the same family that operated the place before .
I also noticed that not one single solitary person was in there besides me .
This time , no one .
I am thinking possible in the future it will not be greek pita anymore .
I am not usually fond of too many places that make lamb because i think lamb is tough to make .
The lamb burger here tastes very fresh and i had it made medium since i have never been here before but mine came out a little medium rare , which is actually my favorite way of having a burger .
I have not been into a good asian / korean restaurant like this in a ver long time i got number 2 , 14 , and 45
A couple of the poke places i tried did not have tofu so was happy it was an option here .
Was not sure what was vegan and was short on time so just chose the vinaigrette but they had a bunch of other sauces i would want to try .
They serve soft tofu so if you do not like soft tofu out of luck there .
Also like the location , high seating and not too busy .
Pancakes were phenomenal , sourdough toast was great , but the eggs were a bit much ..... not sure why one needs to eat 4 or 6 egg omelette !
Although there seemed to be some initial confusion about my appointment , it was short - lived and ended up being no big deal .
I just told her what my costume was , that i usually do not wear much makeup , and that i was open to her creative styling !
Well , not only was abby very friendly , but she did a great job !
Although that by itself does not warrant 3 stars , only offering 3 plates of banchan does !!!
Anyway , it was not thoroughly disappointing , but it was pricey and we did not even get the full - service banchan that i am used to =( and i am sorry if i sound like a jackass , but coming from la i am sure this restaurant would go bankrupt if it had to compete against more authentic korean places .
I have not been to the place itself .
I also ordered the beef bento box that came with fried rice and dumplings and let me tell you , this was not something i would order again .
Second , the dumplings were soaked and not fresh at all .
Not sure if the place itself is any better than the ordered food , but i do not feel like i will be answering this question any time soon .
We ordered a big bowl of pho and that was just average , it did not have enough flavour for the soup base .
It was not bold enough , considering the fact that thr soup base is one of the most important items in the pho ... all in all , a place i would come back but may not drive out of the way to come ...
No wings , no salads , no gyros , no pasta , unlike all of the other generic pizza places around the city that are completely undistinguishable from one another .
Not the best pizza in the world , but a good slice in a city where they are hard to come by .
I had to take my glasses off , and i am blind as a bat without them so i could not see anything clearly at all .
I have never , ever , in my life had such a good blow dry !!
This ayce restaurant is pretty small so expect to wait on a weekend if you did not make reservations .
However , it 's not a huge selection to choose from compared to sushi 168 .
Also , it was a bit brown on the top which was weird =s ... i ate it anyways and have not gotten sick yet so i guess it 's okay ( y ) .
The unagi rolls did not have enough unagi so you could not really taste it .
The avocado on the green dragon rolls were a bit brown ( refer to my picture ) which did not make it very appealing to take pictures of and put on instagram .
Ps : drinks are not included in the ayce price of $ 22.99 .
Overall , prince sushi is decent and not bad but the colouring of the sashimi and avocado made it seem like the food was not very fresh .
I probably would not choose this as my first choice if i wanted to go for ayce sushi though .
But do not go there for a special occasion or if the furnishings are really important to you .
Now i love my dogs but i am not rich so $ 150 is not easy spending money and i do not have credit cards i can just let $ 150 hang out with interest on .
Now i know luna 's ears have a lot of wax in them but i had a feeling in my gut that ear mites was not at all the problem .
They do give out complimentary pet id cards that have the renew dates for your pet 's vaccinations which is helpful for people who can not remember like myself but honestly , this clinic is not the best in town .
Also , do not bother using the free exam coupon on their website , my printer was broken so i showed it to them off my mobile phone explaining that my printer was broken but that is why i came in and they said " sorry we need a paper version " even though i called them on the phone an hour before my appointment and she said showing it off my phone would save paper and it would be fine !
So do not expect great customer service from the front desk while you are there .
I do not understand why some ratings are low : if you are up for milder vietnamese street food , this is the place to go since the seasoning is less strong than most other banh mi places .
The soy sauce is dosed reasonably , there is no excess of fish sauce and the sour , pickled vegetables are kept to a minimum while the mayo is spread diligently .
It 's only an issue in the mornings and has never been an issue when i come in the afternoon ( different staff ) .
It 's not worth it for me at all even though they were nice enough to dropped the rate when i checked out .
I guess i am not aware how lucky i was until i tried healing water .
They did not try to actually get it off of him .
They did not even tell me that he pee 'd all over his stomach and legs .
So now i e had to give my cat a bath because they can not take a urine sample properly .
I was afraid i was going to have to upgrade to the hot tools to get my hair the way i like it , but it was not necessary .
Now it 's no different than any other starbucks when it comes to great quality , but the drive - thru can become very busy during the day .
I appreciate a staff that lets you know that they will be with you and constantly makes sure you are not forgotten when they do get busy .
Less than a year later it was no longer being honored .
Not to mention the worlds most annoying service advisor nik will try and up sale every service known to man ( not to mention repeat himself over and over and over again until you either buy the service or cut him off ) .
Not to mention it somehow takes them at least an hour to change oil .
The waiter could have brought the teas while we were waiting for the take out we ordered for a family member who could not eat with us in the resturant .
Also , i called after we got home just to let them know how my mom got sick badly of the smell and how she through up after we got home but , the person who answered the phone did not understand what i was saying and transfered me to another person who was not listening what i am tell her and kept asking me if i wanted to make a reservation over and over again !
Do not think we will go back again very disappointed !
I will not be able to resist coming back .
If you are in the mood for hibachi do not come here !!
Waiter was nice but i will not be back .
Been ordering coffee from here since 2005 off and on and ever since their recent renovation the coffee has not tasted the same .
On several occasions i have been told that you can not reserve spots on the rooftop on sunday brunch , but you get turned away at the door due to reservations or sent to the bar , while multiple tables are left empty .
All their sandwiches are good actually , it 's not a hit or miss kind of thing , though i recommend getting the viet ones not the regular " western " sandwiches .
Their sushi is mediocre , i would not go there for sushi for sure .
My family patrons this place often ... for the price you can not go wrong .
Is not that pretty standard ?
The staff member insinuated that it was because i could not afford the procedures , which was not the case .
When she could not take it anymore , she told me that she would get the doctor , and left .
I told him of course i had questions as people should , and that i did not understand how he could take my dog in the back and less than two minutes later have a printed paper with estimates .
I did not realize infections were diagnosed so quickly .
He never once closed the door and argued with me in the doorway .
Is not this why people decided to become vets ?
But i will never , and i mean never go back to dr .
He is a horrible human being that does not deserve to help animals or people .
He clearly does not care about anyone or anything but himself .
He is rude and condescending , and does not deserve my business .
As we all know , pets are family , and i will never let my family come into contact with dr .
* i would also like to point out that my dog left bleeding even though i was advised they would not being doing anything invasive , and the affected area has now gotten worse .
Service was very slow , took 15 min to put drink order in , apps took half an hour and the halloumi was not cooked properly .
The waiter was nice , but not attentive .
Mains were not much better - pasta was under cooked fries were under fried .
Definitely never going back .
One dark and gloomy evening , i peeked into the cage where my lady rats live and i found our fat little fluff ball of a rat sprawled in an unusual and uncomfortable position , like an old lady who 'd fallen and can not get up .
It was not easy for us to find a veterinarian who would take in rodents , as their small size makes them harder to diagnose .
When the vet who took on the case was not scheduled at the location the next day , she still made a trip over just to check in on newt and left a voicemail letting us know how she was doing .
The staff did not seem annoyed or bothered by our calls to check in on her , and they were very upfront with us about our options and the costs associated with them .
So , while i generally do not like going to the vet ( means a sick pet , lots of worry , expenses , etc . )
They just put a new cafe in not too long ago with a large menu .
Here they had corn and pineapple ( not sure if pineapple was fresh pineapple or canned , but did not look appealing to me ) .
The plastic bowl itself was too small so you could not mix everything up .
It 's the only poke bowl place in gilbert right now , so if you feel like poke and do not want to drive , it 's fine .
When ordering , the server never asked how i would like my steak prepared .
We had to ask another server to bring us shrimp sauce and when our server later returned , he wreaked of cigarette smoke ... not cool !
Overall , i was utterly disappointed with this establishment and did not feel it was worth the $ 15 .
Mostly , they seemed to have adjusted something so that my rice did not heat my proteins and is not hard .
I just leased a 2015 mazda 3 . did not think i was going to end leaving with a vehicle ; was not sure they could make a deal since i still had time left on my lease .
They worked out in my favor and i could not be happier .
This is not our first rodeo , leasing a car , so we knew what to expect , and quite frankly were dreading the finance process as it is so long and drawn out .
Not with this guy though , he was fast , informative , and we were out of there in about 10 minutes , my kind of paperwork !
All in all , it was a very painless process and a nice surprise they were able to make me a deal i could not refuse .
If you do not have the information , that 's fine , let me talk to the person that does or just take down my info and find out on your time .
I am not a fan of wasting time or playing games .
No games or disrespect .
My salesman seemed fairly nice and personable but was either not competent and a hindrance to the process or playing stupid games .
Either way , that does not work for me .
Vietnamese pho is on target but their laksa is not singapore style .
The hainanese chicken rice is closer but still not quite the same if you are searching for the authentic singapore version .
I usually get the chicken breast and ground chicken kebab skewer combo and have not been disappointed each time .
I found it unusual that they charge you for your bag if you order a take - out because most restaurants do not charge you for the plastic bag used for the take - out .
First , the good : 1 . good food 2 . good decor now , the bad : 1 . bad / rude service ; no " please " or " thank you " ever .... to the cashier girl , if you do not like working there , get another job ....
First , the good : 1 . good food 2 . good decor now , the bad : 1 . bad / rude service ; no " please " or " thank you " ever .... to the cashier girl , if you do not like working there , get another job ....
2 . ordering process is too slow with hordes of people hanging around the cash register waiting for their food making it difficult just to order and pay for food .... this despite the place not being busy .
Even though no one was ordering food , we had to wait 5 minutes before the cashier took our order .... there is no way i would eat here if it was even remotely busy .

3 . sometimes your meal comes with bread and sometimes it does not .... no consistency .
3 . sometimes your meal comes with bread and sometimes it does not .... no consistency .
Some of my office colleagues will not go there because of these issues .
Can not wait to visit again .
My wait is usually not lengthy .
Not a good korean restaurant comparable with other ones in town .
The lighting , the chairs , etc , it gives off the impression that this is a high class establishment and who does not want to go to a high class establishment ???
Do not ever go to a salon to get your makeup and hair done and the owner would not even get their hair done there .
The water tasted nasty and the sushi was not that great either .
I have been going to this location on several occassions and this is the first time i was charged the additional $ 10 . do not think i will be going back .... dry bar here i come ... it is all inclusive of curling iron and blow dry .
Being the reserved and timid guy that i am , i appreciated the fact that everything was explained so well that i did not have to worry about any unexpected surprises , because in all honesty , the process sounds a bit intimidating at first , but here they treat you as a top priority and adapt very well to any needs you might have or any requests you might make so that your personal experience is as best as possible .
Do not be surprised if you feel a rush of cool water , that 's just the colonic machine doing it s job of keeping a constant flow of water going in and out .
It 's not easy to be completely relaxed during colonics but healing waters made it feel more like a spa treatment , i will definitely be back .
And their customer service manager , danny aaron does not even have the decency to follow up to emails when he requests to " make it right " .
Pretty bland for schwarma , the rice had no flavor either , i was surprised to see asian on the menu , not something i would think would fuse well as cuisines go .
Very friendly staff and the place was clean , i just did not blow my hair back .
They do not skimp on the garlic ( which is a favourite of mine ) .
The inegöt köfte ( turkish meatballs -- which are not ball - shaped at all ) was delicious .
We could not even finish half the meal .
Not even close .
Do not go here !!!
She says it 's not flimsy .
Bulgogi and kalbi too expensive so my family did not even order it ( $ 25 - $ 30 for one ) .
There was not much meat in it but it was worth trying and also a large portion .
They are in the basement so do not miss the entrance !
I will admit , i usually come here after a fun time at jimmy d's or carson 's , but this place has consistently kept me coming back ( even in my not so level headed state of mind , oops ) ! !
The line was crazy long so they just gave me my coffee bcz i waited like 7 min in drv thru my order was for a double - they gave me a single but i am not stressed over a free single
I do not know if he 's the owner or the manager but what i do know is that this man is a fine example of human behavior and i believe he needs recognition and patronage .
However , if you are looking for amazing table service , you are not going to find it here .
This is your typical asian style eatery where your food will come as soon as it 's ready , and often times , if you are not dining solo , people at your table will be watching others eat .
The saving grace is that food usually comes out so quick that the watching is not very long .
The broth is not overly complex in flavour , yet it 's still oddly satisfying ( not sure if this is because i am usually starving around lunch ) , and not overly overly salty .
The surroundings are very un - modern , sparse even hut i can not remove star for that as it seems to add to that neighbourhood independent hand made " pizza place " we all remember as kids .
It 's very thick with enough cheese that you will never want to order extra .
The filling is thick , the sauce home made and tasty buy not dominant .
Very cheesy & thick , so do not get thick crust or extra cheese .
I have to say it was great during a week day morning not much going on .
I do not know what to recommend more highly , their fluffy glorious gyros ( which were the best i have ever had in a city of good gyros ) , their juicy feta lamb burger , their fresh baked pizza flat breads , their home made baba ganooj and hummus , their massive mediterranean grocery supply , or their fresh baked pita's which you can watch coming off a conveyer belt carrying them fresh risen out of the oven !
It has a great central location near 16th and camelback and i can never say no to greek food !
Unfortunately , i had to send the first salad back due to wilted lettuce and dirt on it ( i am not just talking one piece ... about half of the salad was like this ! ) .
All in all , i have other greek favorites in the valley so i may not be back but if you are in the area and craving greek food , greka is worth a try !
She kept me abreast of everything that was going on and since i explained to them i really did not have a lot of money she was very " real " with some of her recommendations dependent of the outcomes .
I only tried two varieties of pizza here and have not explored other menu options .
The crust is on the thin side , but is sturdy and does not fold .
If you do not like cheese , do not bother coming here .
Great pancakess - light and fluffy , not too filling .
The ingredients used are descent quality , but authentic pad thai should not be cooked with tomato sauce .
Quality is good , but the taste is not the best .
Not very authentic vietnamese food .
It 's convenient when you are in a rush or do not feel like getting off .
- does not give enough sauce .
Half the items on the menu are not available .
No kabli palow .
I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back .
No accommodations .
No apologies .
My hair stays clean and perfect so i do not buy any hair products anymore because i only have to come once a week .
In the end i am sure i save money by not having to buy all these expensive hair products .
You either have to fold it in half or hold it with both hands , and that 's pretty much not enough .
They are seasoned with something i could not identify and served with tartar .
And do not ever forget to order the pino sticks !
Nothing was out of this world , which is why i can not give five stars , but i would definitely go back !
The staff is friendly and helpful and they have many things that you can not find anywhere else .
I have had amazing pizza in little italy in downtown toronto and this is not that .
The flavor of the dough was also great and not overpowered by the rest of the pizza .
The cheese could be a bit better quality but you can not argue with the amount that they put on .
Not the best pizza i have ever had but definitely the best pizza in durham .
No need for syrup .
The rice was cold and the kabobs were burned , , never coming here again ... for best afghan food and best customer service go to naan and kabob restaurant ...
I had an omelet with american cheese ( it was a friday in lent , so i can not speak for the meat ) ; they make each omlete with 6 or maybe even 8 eggs , and it fills up the whole plate .
I was not feeling the love from the pancakes or the coffee , however .
The coffee was extremely strong , so that 's fine if you like it that way , but i do not .
There was not really anything wrong with the pancakes , they just were not anything to write home about ; they had a bit of a burnt taste .
Gets parasites , yeast , out i never in a million years would i have believed the build up .
I believe it helped me with my not needing oxegen 24 / 7 .
And a person there told me when he was sick with flu or something he could not shake .
He went in and he felt great after said he could not explain it but weird .
This helped me to be more aware about what my body can digest and what my body can not .
This restaurant is not known for it 's decor , but the food is great !
We also got the hot braised chicken , which is fried ( not too greasy ) and spicy enough to taste the flavor of the chicken .
This treatment is amazing , my hair ( normally takes forever to style ) is silky smooth , looks amazingly healthy and takes about 10 minutes to dry and no ironing needed !!!
However in pittsburgh , do not imagine that the korean restaurants are on par w/ places in other urban centers .
I have not had sushi with all the different little sauces they top the rolls with .
Fresh and well made , not too big , not too small .
I have always liked it here , never had any problems .
There was one vet i did not like there 10 years ago , but , now that s it .
I can not tell you how many times i have been here , my one dog " sugar " had addison 's disease .
I have never had any issues here , and have never really been hauled over the coals with add ons !
And since we opted for the salad to be tossed in the kitchen , we can not really complain about the dressing overload part .
But let me just say that my husband is a real bacon lover and even he proceeded to push extra bacon bits he could not consume to the side of his plate which by the end of our belly - busting meal , created a small tower .
Again , not necessarily a bad thing for those wanting a hefty meal but for us , it was supposed to be lunch .
I can not even begin to describe what this thing looked like .
( please refer to the photos ) i had one slice and could not dare grab another one .
How could it not be with that much goodness ???
My 11 year son was not keen on the idea of having poke for dinner , but after eating here , it completely changed his mind .
There 's no point of a drive thru if you are waiting just as long .
Not many people inside and still saw no one come to the window for a few minutes .
Visit 2 ) passion tea - no classic syrup .
No acknowledgement from the guy " sweeping " 2 ft in front of me .
Girl who made it cops an attitude and says she put a passion tea out 20 mins ago but no one has claimed it ( glares at me ) .
Each time i try it i am reminded why it 's not my favorite place .
Staff - typically running late with no acknowledgement to the customer .
Bright coral lipstick and heavy eyes was not my idea of natural .
Quality seems decent but never holds up a long time after like other places .
It 's not my favorite blow dry bar but if you are patient , have extra time , and not too picky it 's worth the discounted price of a groupon offer .
I started going here when i got a sugar glider and the associated vet near me did not take exotics .
Yes , fees were a little high , but not anymore than to be expected and not higher than i have experienced at other animal hospitals .
Needing to take your furry family member into the animal hospital is never a pleasant experience , but the doctor and the staff made it as comfortable as possible for all of us ( most importantly , millie . )
So do not be surprised if you find this mall a bit deserted on weeknights .
The pho here is not bad and i consider it to be one of the better ones in markham .
I admit , we did not do such a great job of socializing her , so she gets over- excited and anxious at the vet 's office .
While i am not saying , " hey , if you have a nervous , poorly socialized dog , feel free to unleash your demon at this vet 's office " , i am thankful that the staff is so understanding , patient , tolerant and caring of * our * personal demon .
Although we never found out exactly why chelsie had proteuria , dr. munchausen did not immediately prescribe a bunch of drugs or treat chelsie like a medical experiment .
The roti did not have that baked goodness on both sides , only one side was baked .
The flavour and freshness was not there .
Flavour of that dish was not bad .
Can not believe they charge for takeout containers ... and they do not take credit card .
Atmisphere is like a food court - wall is not closed so you can hear everything from the hall outside the restaurant in the mall ... and there happened to be 2 small undisciplined children hooting and hollering .
The naan is not your typical naan , it 's a little harder , smaller and thicker but nonetheless really good .
Service is self - serve ( food court ) and a little slow but i think it 's because they make all their meats fresh to order so we did not mind waiting longer even though i was starved .
My head felt less foggy and clear after my hydrotherapy and i did not go for the whole hour .
Of course the view was nice , but i did not get one of the booths near the window .
The servers was really nice throughout our meal but were not quite that attentive .
Crispy , light and not greasy .
I can not quite tell what the sauce was , but it was a great pair with the octopus .
It was also cooked to a good tenderness level and was not chewy and gummy like .
Roasted lamb cutlets ( $ 45 ) this was bit pricey .. but lamb ai not cheap so , i let it slide .
They will bill you act like it was put on some kind if credit which it 's not .
I understand late fees but interest on bills that are not credit is robbery .
Just do n't give this place your business
Sales : i would never buy a car from them again .
The salesmen lied to us and promised us a rebate we never got .
The sales manager is no better and does not stand behind what his salesmen promise .
My car is always ready when promised and if it is not , she will give me a loaner .
I have known about the richlane plaza for awhile but never really dabbled into the food .
It was not too spicy but another heart warming dish with various spices .
If you love to be pampered this is not the place .
After reading a few not counted posts , i read there is a new owner here , which explains everything .
Not bad .
The other places give miso soup so that sucks they do not offer extras like that .
The bulgogi bento box comes with fried rice but it is not listed on the menu .
My husband is not a fan of it so after it was served we asked for white rice .
The waitress informed us it would be an extra $ 2 . it just did not seem fair since it s not listed but we asked for it anyway .
My bim bim bap was not bad , it was just okay .
We will not be going back .
I would not recommend this place to anyone , check out the competition down the street .
The girls are fine , it 's the manager , i bought a package , and i have never felt more uncomfortable in my life .
I saw her in the mirror having a fit , literally ... i will not go back , funny thing , i called to complain to the owner and i got her on the phone ..... i have not used the entire package , do not want to go back that 's how bad it was .

Too bad that a package purchase means nothing to this place .... i feel sorry for the girls working there , that they have to put up with this women , i do not know how they can relax and do there job with someone managing like this .... funny before entering the door i was telling my husband that i wanted a gift certificate for my birthday , upon walking out i was almost in tears , swearing to never go back ....

I never have to wait too long for a drink when i walk on or use the drive - thru .
The beverages are made the way i order them and i have never had any issues .
We were not disappointed .
It 's not in the best location as it is out of the way , but the pizza is delicious !
Service : not the worst but , definitely could improve a bit .
Few time we have walked in and had to wait few quite a bit before they even say hi to you when the restaurant was not even busy .
The staff was friendly and was not overbearing .
We were a large party of nine , and i can understand its can be challenging but the service was not up to par .
I have worked as a server for three years , and i know what to say and not to say .
Although the super - pulpy orange juice is not my favorite .
The service however , was not .
You certainly will not be receiving any of my money ever again .
I would not even give the bell road mazda service dep not one star , except that s the only choice i have .
They did not have the part in at that time , but pete assured me it was covered under warranty and to let him know when i have the time to bring the car back in .
No big deal , until i drive away and realize the tech broke the left / right toggle switch to adjust the side mirrors , and shoved the driver side vent adjuster clean into the dash somehow .
I did not have another hour & 1 / 2 to wait for them to fix this , so pete assured me they would take care of it at my next visit .
Here it is december , i have a little time to bring it in , and pete no longer works there .
John reached out to pete , who remembers my mom , remembers me , my last visit with the car , but conveniently does not remember the switch being broken , the vent adjuster , or manually adjusting my mirror for me , and did not note my account regarding the part # of the cracked motor mount or tat it was cracked !
So basically , i am being called a liar about their tech breaking the switch , and the motor mount can not be called in until they have the car there , to see which part it is .
So there 's a good chance i will have to sit there only to be told they do not have the part .
Do not expect to be taken care of if they do something wrong .
As adults , most of us learn to take responsibility for what we do wrong , and to do a good job at whatever we do - like noting someone 's account properly ... but not the chapman mazda service dep not .
The rice falls apart too easily when you try to pick each piece up with chop sticks and the crispy cali rolls are not too crisp .
The appetizers were great i just was not impressed with the sushi , which was a bummer ... customer service was good though .
I had this place bookmarked for a cheap spot to eat , and i finally got to try it when i was on my way to the old port and knew food would not be cheap there .
Usually i do not like bahn mi but this place rocks !
If i lived in nyc and had this pizza , i would not return , but pittsburgh 's pizza selection is really wildly low .
Benny 's pizza is not super chewy , it is like what you would get in nyc with a nice crunch and a tender center .
I do not mind that too much , but wish they had one other size .
No wings and other stupid things , thank goodness !
Went shooting at ben avery for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was not bad at all !
We have been using the archery range been out three times now , not been overly crowded the times we have gone .
I have been coming to this range for around 34 years and have never seen anything to suggest this .
I have been a little put off by the management -- not terribly friendly and unprofessional .
No one bothered to call and tell me that my requested stylist was no longer there .
If i purposely make an appointment weeks in advance because i like the way someone does my hair , i expect to be notified if they can not follow through on their end of the deal .
The stylist did a great job and not her fault but i still would have liked the heads up before my appointment so i could cancel if i wanted ( which is why i think they were shady and dishonest about notifying me ) .
I will not be back .
I am not much of the yelp reviewing type -- but , i feel the need to throw some love to primp and blow as the reviews on here are ... rough !
I had a blow - out , scalp massage and make - up. my 4 - stars is only because there was not anyone at reception when i walked in and the stylist did not offer assistance until i asked for help .
They do not have a big restaurant but the service is slow so it makes it harder to overlook .
Obviously i could not tell because the menu is in english and chinese and did not obviously say bun bo hue .
The broth did not retain any of the flavour of tomato that a traditional soup should have .
But if we are saying it 's not bun bo hue the soup is still on the thin side as the flavour of spice is the only thing that you taste .
The oxtail is tough but is sliced thin so that you are not trying to gnaw on a huge tough piece of meat .
My overall impression is that the food is decent but not anything that 's going to impress you or make you come back unless it 's convenient .
Unfortunately this restaurant 's food would not bring me back and the service is what it is .
Definitely never coming back .
You can seriously go to town on a ton of sushi and not pay more than $ 20 if you go during the half price time .
I had a window seat ( we did leave a note on the reservation requesting a window seat , but upon arrival , did not get the seat we requested .
It was not at all full , so we requested the window seat after being seated , in which they accommodated ) .
I did not go out to the deck after , so maybe if i did , my mind would have changed .
Not mind blowing .
Not sure .
There were not really any customers there but we sat down anyway .
Overall , it 's quite overpriced but the food quality is not bad .
We had no clue what to expect .
Thankfully realizing it was not ours .
However , our uber was a little small and we could not even fit the pizza in !
Now the pizza they have is very different than your normal day to day pizza , they do thick crusts , but unlike other pizza joints , they are not stingy with their toppings and cheese .
We decided to try out prince sushi since he 's never tried it before and i have not gone back in over two years .
It was quite empty sunday evening so reservations were not required .
But if you are going in a larger group i suggest calling in because the restaurant is not that big .
We did not even get to order a second round of food haha .
We both liked how they did not skimp out on the stuffing within the maki rolls .
My boyfriend enjoyed his spicy salmon hand roll because it was not stuff with a lot of rice .
Unsure about any of the other food they serve there , as the pho is just so good i do not bother getting anything else .
Only con i can think of , is during summer sometimes , may get a bit warm while eating the delicious hot pho , since the store is open air to the rest of the mall , which does not have that great air conditioning .
I have not fired a gun in probably 20 years .
But bit pricey considering it is not a full service restaurant .
I do not like the fact that not even water is served .
( when the restaurant is almost empty and it was not in the rush hours )
Luckily the food was good - i got the mojo de ajo tofu , and never knew tofu could taste that good .
My sister got the branzino , and although i am not the biggest fan of branzino , i found it quite enjoyable .
However the cost was a lot higher than i would have expected and of course they could not give me a quote or any idea of a price before i went in .
$ 376 to test for a urinary tract infection and i still had to wait for the results because they could not test inhouse .
If it cost $ 376 for the simple test i did not want to know the cost for the more extravagant tests
It s a bit of a drive but they open at 7 am during the summer months so you can be out shooting while it s not 100 .
I guess the worst thing about this place is the morons who can not follow range commands .
My ginger dressing on my ginger salad tasted kind of funny and was not good .
Not only close to home but , the care that everyone from front desk to drs provide my dog is fantastic !
I am from california and unfortunately we do not have this type of place near by our house .
The food is on point it was the 3rd time i came here and the food never change the quality .
My friends and i intended to go for brunch , but kost only offers brunch on weekends , not even on holidays .
Either because the restaurant was not super busy at that time ( 7:15 pm , friday night ) or everything is premade accelerating service speed .
You can always ask for more if you want and we did since one small dish is not quite enough to share between 3 people .
Service was average , basically minimal and did not pay much attention to not only our table but other tables in general .
I can not imagine how much msg they put into that soup !!
If you do not have the ability to make good food without adding so much crap and junk into it , then please do not trick all customers and making their body suffer !
But i would not recommend this place to any of my friends / family and would n't be a choice to come back !
I am thinking no i like foreign hair in my food ) .......... at the end my family finished before i even had my food and i would assume they would want to at the very least pay for my horrible breakfast ....... the answer was no !
And we do not care if your a decent customer who comes in a lot ....... we do not care if you come back ............. to the owner or person who called themselves an owner ...... you suck as a restaraunteur
And we do not care if your a decent customer who comes in a lot ....... we do not care if you come back ............. to the owner or person who called themselves an owner ...... you suck as a restaraunteur
The downtown prices do not fit the east york thornecliffe location .
For those with late - night hunger pains , or interested in an incredibly satisfying greasy blend of cheese , tomato sauce , and crispy bread to really hit the spot , look no further than this welcoming pizza shop .
Things i did not like : - toppings can be low quality e.g. mushrooms that look like they came from a can overall , a great place to grab a hefty , filling slice of pizza !
They will not disappoint , just do not expect anything gourmet .
No creamer on the bar , and they were put out to provide a good customer experience .
No greeting when entering the store , or waiting in line .
Store is not very clean .
When i want good quality sushi and do not want an ayce sushi then i usually go to prince sushi .
I have been here several times and seems to be one of the few restaurants that get filled up in that area of courtney park , while several other surrounding restaurants get literally no customers all day .
I really enjoy the sushi as they do not fall apart and are a good size .
Literally imagine a hole in the wall type place , white walls without any decorations , nothing visually pleasing to look at , but you do not care because you are literally sensory overloaded by the smell of the food from the kitchen upon entering the restaurant .
The decor , atmosphere , and ambiance is great with no screaming kids , overly loud music , or clanging dishes and utensils .
It is a great dish if you want to sample the pides and do not know which one you like .
You can not say that for many restaurants these days !
Never been disappointed .
If you have never been there before , they will make you watch a short safety video , or you can watch it online beforehand .
You are not supposed to touch anything on the tables during breaks , for example .
Do not touch it without permission .
I do not find it mean , it 's just safety measures .
I would not want someone bumping and accidentally firing a weapon that was loaded while i was out changing targets .
It 's outdoors , but the tables are covered so you are not out in the sun the whole time .
They do not allow food out on the range .
When they are not completely swamped , the frappuccino's are made very icy and thick .
Lol bottom line is do not do it to yourself
We go here sometimes when we do not feel like going far .
My feet started to itch from the impulses in the water , but not too bad to be annoying .
I could not get it in .
At first it was just a strange feeling of water going where water should not be .
I was a little sad i did not watch what came out from the beginning .
I prayed i would not die .
I prayed it would not kill me .
I knew what to expect and the pain was not even close to bad .
It 's not too doughy like pizza pizza pizza but not too thin .
The toppings will not slide off like other places .
Not too small or big with a good amount of meat on them .
Only thing i can complain about is that the pizza can not come fast enough !!
I do not know how the elite members can give this place higher than a two star .... the neighborhood and the parking was shady and lacking .
The interior was very bland - no decor and no korean tv shows .
Or no decoration .
There was only four side dishes : not fresh kimchee , kong - na - mul , motion - kimchee , and a fourth that we can not remember .
They were below average , and not very good nor fresh .
So i ordered kim cheegigae - that was disappointing too , not very plentiful and the pork pieces had the bone knuckles .
I guess i can not recommend any place in pittsburgh for a great sit down korean style dinner place yet .
Our doxie had surgery , and the healing process ( stitches ) did not go as well as the surgery .
Dr. white , however , redid our baby 's stitches twice at no extra cost !
I could not believe it , and i will always be grateful to her and her facility for saving or doxie 's life .
Other starbucks either put too much sweetener or not enough .
I got a seaweed salad , which just did not taste right , even though i have had them at osaka before and thought they tasted great in the past .
The chicken was overcooked , the vegetables were overcooked , and not fresh cut , for example the carrots obviously came out of a large can of cut cooked carrots , and tasted like those hard things i remember from school days .
I was a bit skeptical given the lukewarm reviews and the mcrestaurant feel of this place ( it 's like a subway if subway did banh mi ) - also , it 's by all the bars on st .- denis so they are not exactly serving a picky audience -- but decided to give it a go .
Definitely not the best i have had -- but probably one of the better banh mi spots i have go to in north america .
The girl that called sounded very rushed and was not very clear as to why she was canceling .
To this day , i have never heard back from them .
Do not give them your business !
Do not use healing waters !
I could not ask for a better first experience .
But having a range master tell you when you can / can not shoot is a pita so my friends & i always just go to table mesa now .
The waiters are so not nice , polite and understanding !
I was reading through yelp reviews before deciding to drive to ajax from scarborough for pizza and i saw a photo with the comment : " two adults could not even finish a medium 10 " pizza " .
I did not leave a message and called the operator 's extension back thinking it was maybe a mistake .
I called the service department and it rang over and over again with no option for a voicemail .
I love the miata and will probably want to buy another one ( or more ) in the future , but probably not from chapman .
I can not totally rule them out because i have not been in to the dealership , but the treatment i got over the phone for a simple question was enough to steer me away .
Korea garden is hard to miss - but please do not - you will not regret it !
Get some of the korean hot sauce ( ask for it if they do not provide it ) . it ( in small amounts for my wimpy self ! ) just adds the perfect amount of spice to it .
We tried to visit at least twice before only to leave in frustration because we could not find a parking spot .
With glee , we took that vacated space , entered the restaurant , and were seated with no wait whatsoever .
He was elated that we finally made it and seemed to be precognitive ; we felt he knew us despite never having met him .
Her name was ( i think ? ) nicole , and she is not only an aspiring model but also previously hailed from kay 's general area .
I found the large , chunky , auroral potatoes to be flawless and the plentiful corned beef to be as keenly kosher and arcanely flavorful as any i have ever had , but kay did not like it as much as i did , sadly enough .
The dutch baby is not a pancake ; it is a bowl of doughy love , made lardy by the butter , lightly sweet by the powdered sugar , and acidic by the lemon .
Kay and i were so taken by the oph 's hospitality , we almost forgot that we were not at someone 's home and had other plans for the day .
Chicken was average tasty huge chunks , but nothing special , as it was a bit bland and was not overcooked / not dry so that was good .
For payment , she started on the opposite end and did not inform everyone that tip was already included and it was noticed after some paid ( i could not hear much because of the long table ) , but i heard the manager scold and yell at two people from my table whom caught the tip and asked for a refund on the double tip ( one was clarifying what the service charge was ) .
The manager said to both separately ( yelling ) that " it 's not my job .
I already told people earlier " and one of them told her not everyone was aware since she was on the other end of the table .
She complained and was annoyed at having to do two - three refunds ( not everyone bothered to ask ) .
This was extremely unprofessional and we felt that she did this on purpose ( being dishonest ) hoping nobody would notice or would not bother doing anything so she 'd have extra tip .
I will continue to book appointments with primp and blow because i have never been disappointed with my look .
Lots of space and i hope it does well - this particular place in this strip mall has a tendency to not to well ( burger king , some carribean place , another turkish place have been in this exact location before pasha opens ) .
It 's a very posh place and definitely not cheap .
I got the branzino which 2as delicious , but one of my colleagues got the tofu and was not that impressed with it .
I would not recommend this for a sit down dinner , but it 's a nice place for drinks and apps with friends if you do not mind splurging .
First time i went was in ramadan , food was not on point at all , meat was tough and lamb were under cooked ( i chalked this up to the fact that it was iftar time and restaurant was packed ) recently we went another few times and it s so disappointing because some thing or another is always missing here from the menu .
My bf said beef was not very fresh so he just ate noodle .
I will not say i will go back there again .
I give 4 stars because they are a little to strict on safety , i know " you can never be to safe around guns " but the range officers here do not even let you put a spotting scope to your eye - you have to keep your safety glasses on your eyes !
I was not disappointed !
The service is ok but ordering from a lady who can not understand english or french and needed repeated instructions was a bit of a put -off .
Decided to visit this place as a bday treat ... i was not disappointed .
Wonderful service ( my glass was never empty ) & amazing fresh food .
Not only was my hair fantastic , i able to book an appointment online on the same day .
I went in with my friend and was a bit hesitant because i did not know what to expect ... we were greeted and offered water ( it was a bit funny though , when my girlfriend made the appointment she spelled out her name , and when we got there they still had it wrong ) .
Ok - i had a good experience ... but the overall tone of this place is just not good !
She was not offered wine and her stylist did not flat iron her hair in small pieces like she had asked .
Please do not waste your money here ... go where you are appreciated !
I can not believe in the economy that people would even take that approach .
We asked for no olives in the ahi salad and mayo on the side for the one of the blt sandwiches .
We waited for 40 min for the food to come , and it came with a lot of olives in the salad , no mayo at all , and no bacon in the kost burger .
However , was not impressed with the quality .
Not exciting .
My only complaint is the exterior of the restaurant , it needs some renovation and does not reflect at all the great food inside !
This place is amazing and anyone who is not giving it 5 stars is crazy .
Her hair is pretty straight and easy to work with , yet a blow dry and two braids did not hold for even 45 minutes .
I believe that is one of starbucks philosophies is to ensure that you are satisfied .. believe me when my coffee is not on point , it will be on point when starbucks has been made aware .
There was not one time that any one of these characters came over and asked what i was waiting on ... i suppose the level of customer service is not the priority here .
I was in so much pain i wanted to die - and i am not kidding !
I could not keep any food down - i was even puking up ice chips !
I went to the emergency room and even had to have an iv and to be put on medication ( which i am very against going to conventional drs and especially getting meds - esp when i am pregnant - esp during my 1st trimester ) well needless to say , going to the dr did not help me .
I only took one pill and then read the instructions which say - do not take in 1st trimester - what was the dr thinking !!
I was in such diar need of help , i was afraid they would turn me away , because i was panting , had severe back spasms , could not sit or stand only lay .
I was covered with a towel , she just had to feel around to place the tube in my colon - ( i was so sick i could not do it myself ) and she started the machine .
I let me know that i was very toxic ( as i had not had a bowel movement in 3 weeks ) . anyway , i finished the colonics with my very wonderful supportive husband by my side and have we nt back again to clean the rest of my colon .
Every since i have been there , my spasms have totally stopped , my friends and family told me that color has returned to me and i have not had morning sickness since i had my colonics .
It 's suppose to not stop until at least my 12th week !
I not only was able to clear my colon , which allowed my liver to release pint up toxins , but was advised of a diet according to my blood type , and was given a ton of information on ph in blood and body and how that can affect the yeast that grows in your intestines and how that effects even the food you crave .
It felt funny walking out at 11:30 am so dolled up , but that 's just b/c i do not wear much makeup on a daily basis .
Can not wait to try again
The spicy beef rice noodle soup was not spicy whatsoever .
Not only there was no issue , the waitress voluntarily suggested to instruct the kitchen to make the chinese green extra soft .
Hostess is not effective .
Not from phoenix , but did not want to be shopping hangry !
This place not only provides the services on their menu but go above & beyond to help you better your health holistically !
You would not expect the outskirts of charlotte to have an awesome sushi place but lo and behold , osaka is the place .
Unlike your typical japanese cuisine , osaka is your hole - in - a- wall type of restaurant , it is not fancy and does not have much of an atmosphere , but who cares ?!
I do not care for much of the hibachi items at any japanese restaurant so i never tried theirs but it just looks like your typical hibachi you order anywhere .
I have had no problems with service , staff is friendly and attentive .
The extra effort osaka shows to their customers sets osaka above many places i have been to ( hell i can not even recall many times where i got added - value items on the house , even at nice " 5 - star " restaurants ) .
I was not super impressed with the shawarma .
The falafel is freshly fried and while not the best texture was very flavorful with a nice crunch .
The pickles on it were actually pretty good even though i am not a pickle fan ... definitely house made and not soggy .
I will be back and can not wait to checkout their main location .
This is my favourite sushi place in mississauga and i try to not let too much time pass between my visits .
Can be a little tricky to find a table during the holidays due to it 's small - ish size but no problems otherwise .
Not a problem as we can always order more .
I am not afraid to say it but i prefer the food here compared to bamiyan kabob .
You will not be disappointed with the food here that 's for sure .
It took 20 mins for our food to be called which was a tad too long for a place like this and many tables were not cleaned up with trays and food .
I may be nitpicking here but the lady at the cash just did not seem very friendly .
But overall , i had a good enough experience with the food and the service did not detract too much from the overall experience .
( it might seem far but really is not much further , time wise due to highway speed limits , than casa grande ) the cost is $ 7 pp with sighting scopes available for a rental fee of $ 1 -- can not beat that !
This is a managed / fully staffed range , meaning there 's a range master and many safety personnel who ensure there 's no firing during a cease fire .
Everyone must clear their guns and can not approach their shooting area for about 10 minutes .
Parking is not a problem .
A wide selection of paper targets is available but there are no ammo sales or gun rentals .
When we visit other unstaffed ranges , it 's always interesting to watch people who do not know what they are doing .
They just do not understand that they become a moving target at their own risk !
One time they offered something to drink , next time they did not .
I will return , but i will not go on a saturday when that person works .
If the bell signal does not work , and you do not check on me , do not short change me on the amount of time due .
Like i said - i do recommend it highly , just not on saturdays .
Bowls were pretty good , i did not like that they put the " toppings " ( sesame seeds , crispy onion ) under the other types of toppings ( seaweed salad , fruit , edamame ) .
Dr white has always been professional , she tells me exactly what he needs , and gives me recommendations , but never has tried to nickel and dime me .
Her recommendations have always been what 's best for my dog and unlike other vets she does not try to get me to spend unnecessary money on things that do not matter .
They also take walk ins with little to no wait time most of the time .
I can not recommend this place enough .
Also , a front desk receptionist ( i am not sure of her name ) always calls my dog " the little parvo survivor " every time we stop in , even if it 's for a nail trim .
I asked for the gyro and baklava , and asked what else could i not live without - he told me the chicken shawarma was incredible , so i ordered that , as well .
It was shaved meat , not sliced meat .
The flavor was spot on - but the texture was just ... odd . and - my fault - i do not care for lettuce on my gryo - just the meat , tomato , onion , and tzatziki .
To the point i could not really tell it was chicken .
It was accompanied by a miso soup and five small bowls of assorted pickled and fresh veggies , which we were not expecting because the menu did not mention them .
The place is not decorated at all , and the hot tea is served out of ugly plastic pitchers which grow cold too quickly .
She did not try to pressure me and she was extremely friendly .
Anyone looking for a new or used mazda need look no further
Today i ordered a caramel flan frap , no coffee , with coconut milk .
My kid was screaming since it was a long wait so i had not noticed it was wrong until i drove away .
I was not pleased .
No really , do not turn around , do not judge this book by it s cover - go in and sit down and order .
It should not be humanly possible to eat that much soup .
I was lucky they were open on sunday took my little hummingbird in they called it a good samaritan thing and did not charge me for seeing the bird , examining it and passing it on to a rehab person .
I can not believe the things the colonic has helped with - skin , stress , digestion , indigestion .
Not as pricey as similar in the area .
The food is authentic , consistently delicious and never disappoints .
Nice friendly staff , although some do not speak english , only vietnamese and french !
I asked why she did not charge me for what i had asked for and as is listed on their price list .
Did not argue , just paid the bill and left .
Unfortunately we will not be going back there anytime soon .
This place does not seem like much , but if you want pizza that is hearty and eats like a meal this is the place .
This place is good for takeout , i personally would not want dine there as the place is kinda suspect .
I was skeptical of coming here because of the reviews , but i was here during lunchtime and no one is in the restaurant , but me .
Food is fresh , it 's not top notch ( because i was lucky enough to go to seoul , but it ultimately does not matter , plus i live in philly so restaurants there are great ) , but i thought it was great and prices are perfectly fine .
People try and find such cheap food / labor for cuisines that are not as common in the us , so i never try to argue about prices to a reasonable extent .
The procedure was not bad at all .
We received 2 orders of salmon sashimi , no tuna sashimi , 2 orders of beef tataki and the rest of what we order .
I am not posting this review for the coupon , did not even use it but this place is great .
Ik pide , was not bad but not so great .
They sell foods you can not find at giant eagle and everything is authentic .
Friendly staff and most of the time are watching out for those newbies who do not know how to handle a weapon .
You will not be disappointed .
There 's never a wait when we make an appointment and our regular vet , dr. lee , is always very sweet with my dog .
The only issue is the staff and value does not compliment the establishment .
No big deal ... maybe just the time .
( ^ ^ ) seems the staff made a mistake , got us another menu ... no big deal .
" sure no problem she remarked but this is how we measure our pour she remarked " we are talking about sangria here ... wine soda and fruit / juice right ?
Probably a blessing in disguise as if this place is hurting that much that they can not afford to pour . 93 cents of sangria into a proper wine glass portion we can just imagine the food .
There 's simple no need for this today , we are not expecting trucker proportion but simple some basic value .
Not impressed and definitely would never go back .
There is no near street parking so you usually have to park quite a journey away and just walk .
As someone who was not raised around guns or ever participated in this type of activity i appreciate all the help i have been given making sure my son is trained , safe and has a ton of fun .
To the polly d look alike fuck you the best way to not get a tip is to make sure to make your customer wait for 30 min for drinks .
Never seen that before .
The catch is if you order too much sushi & do not finish it , there 's a penalty for each piece not eaten .
It smelled delicious and i could not wait to come back for dinner .
The workers could not have been nicer and helped us with the menu items .
We also got hummus and pita ( not on menu ) - they gave us a full container of the roasted red pepper hummus with pita which was very delicious .
They also have a lunch menu , but i did not look at that .
The service was really not that great , but it was not the worst i have had either .
Leaps and bounds over the rest of the places i have been to and it is not even that good .
They have real sugar coke and if you do not take advantage of that , well , your loss .
No pizza is that good .
Because not even in chicago or nyc is a pizza this large $ 35 .
Been here a few times as ayce places go this is one of the better i have tried but their menu has changed so you don not to have options of all the classics anymore .
Like that they offer dessert even though not listed on the menu .
The meal itself was good , but for the price could not be beat .
Not very impressed .
And for this we waited well over 20 minutes with no one at the counter ahead of us .
Should really be a one star but the rice did not taste bad after i heated it up ( it came stone cold ) .
I will not come here the second time ever !
The service is bad , the price is too high and the food is not worthy !
We ordered the first two bbq on the menu but when they came out apparently not " bbq " at all and each dish is around $ 30 !
I do not think i have seen spicy gyro at many places , and this one is pretty great .
The asian fare is ok , it 's what you would expect - not great , but definitely not bad either .
I know that i know what i am doing with a gun , but my assumption at a range , or driving a car down the freeway , is that every other person that i do not know is an idiot , who might do anything , at any time .
Came with a salad where the lettuce was not cut into pieces less than 5 " long .
It was not served with any dressing .
The staff is wonderful i seriously could not rate one better than the next !
The parking is not great .
This was not what i was used to .
The girl at the cash did not seem like she knew any background knowledge of the place she works at .
However , after trying it i realized that it was pretty bland and did not have enough flavour .
I mean , it was not horrible but definitely not the best afghan food that i have tried .
It tasted very good , no complaints at all .
Not a big seafood fan but the crab meat is amazing !
My engine light came on an my local fletchers could not fix it .
I would not usually mind but i did tell them i had things to do and to please keep me posted on the progress .
I did not hear from anyone for about 90 min when i went out to check on their progress .... no word but they would check .
I did not hear from anyone for about 90 min when i went out to check on their progress .... no word but they would check .
Not really worth going back .
I have never been disrespected as i was today .
I have no idea how this poor excuse of a girl got a job in customer service , but she does not belong there .
Had to ask her five times because she did not want to .
I really do not know what her problem was , but this whole thing was ridiculous .
At first i was not sure , it looked so different , but the more i saw it the more i liked it .
I was very happy with my experience and i can not wait to book another appointment with jessica .
Not the case : i looked like a pasty new jersey girl .
Not only did i feel stupid paying for this disaster , i felt extra ridiculous walking by scottsdale 's finest on saturday afternoon , on the way back to my car .
Now it has been a few days and i have hair that is breaking where it was never breaking before , i had to go to my stylist and have her cut it and deep condition it !!!
I hate to call someone out but i would not want this to happen to anyone else , if you chance it and go here make sure you ask for someone other than katie .
It s only available in the evening , prices are not that great because it is evening ( 20 + ) , not a lot of room , staff is so so , and it s hard to get a spot .
The food is not bad but it 's not the best considering all the hassle i have to go through .
It 's not like you can order all the ice cream you can eat .
Sadly , it 's not enough to make me a regular customer considering the vast array of options in the gta .
I have not had any problems so far and am happy with their service .
I love roti , but i could not find good place in toronto .
If she was a possible parvo she should not have aloud to possibly come in contact with dogs ?
But were not sure what was wrong .
They would not talk about natural helpers or never asked what we feed her ?
My dogs not an experiment ?
Do not go here !
Not sure that i would come here often anymore .
And in my opinion you should not order one with toppings since they are not cooked in the pizzas , they are just added on top and reheated .
One small criticism , i wish they 'd keep a container of gel granulated garlic to sprinkle on top , not the garlic salt that they have since it makes the pizza too salty .
It was bought out and renamed almost identically as " sola pizza " and is no longer any good .
Decor is not anything to write home about and the staff are " minimally functional " at best , so you are not going here for the ambience .
I had not been to healing waters in quite some time and was pleasantly surprised in the renovations they had done .
Needless to say , that smell does not go well with sushi .
Not be back .
Ask for these two to help you can not go wrong !!!
The hummus was lumpy and did not taste like much of anything .
I called to let them know their tzatziki was rancid so hopefully no one gets sick .
Stopped on my way from utah to california so can not really say much else about the place .
I liked the crowd - it was mostly families which is not surprising considering the area .
Not too bad .
Eggrolls are not good , so do not order them .
I had no issues w/ service , but i also am vietnamese and am just used to vietnamese service , which can be curt and to the point .
The woman who took my shooting fee was friendly and offered me eye , hearing protection and targets ( which i did not need ) .
Brass is policed and not littered everywhere , like at many other ranges , clubs i have been to .
The only time i come here is with my buddy muza he loves this place i do not know why they looks the same food is good but a bit pricy but good will still come here enjoy
Today there was no onion or pickles , so confused !
I was thrown off since we were not offered anything to drink , eat , magazines to read ... essentially everything the website boasts .
They also do not have a look book , so you just have to describe what you want ; lucky for us , we both have short hair so it was pretty easy .
We should not have had to ask for a drink - it should have been offered when we walked in .
Never apologized , thanked me for coming in , nothing .
I will go back as long as that guy is not my waiter .
I work in the food industry and understand situations and attitude , there is no excuse for his behavior , at least take it away from view of your customer .
The hummus taste like a bowl of soup , watered down with no flavor .
I will not review on the actual place since i was not actually in there , but the food !
The price is similar to that of big chains , like dominos and pizza hut but the quality of the ingredients and that thick crust homemade goodness can not be beat .
The service was good , definitely not the greatest i have ever encountered but they get the job done .
This place is a little bit off the beaten track and is not somewhere i 'd necessarily go out of my way to find again .
You will not regret it .
I do not know if you need to eat this right in the shop but we ordered from postmates and it was bad .
Would not recommend .
There are a lot of traditional turkish taste to choose , so you can easily pick one from the menu that you would love even if you are not familiar with them .
Not fast .
I do not suggest sitting out on the patio like people do here ... it smells .
Not only does it stink but the car fumes and smokers are out of control .
I have been inside and it s not the cleanest .
Well if you have not tried this restaurant then you definitely need to add it to your list .
Whenever i have a bit more time and not in a rush i like to drop by and grab a bite at this restaurant .
I would not say their located in a difficult place to get to but it s not a quick in and out restaurant .
But it was so big on this smallish guy ... real drapey on him ... and i turned to the guys i was with and said , " is that a hit man or a wannabe hitman ? " we could not decide .
4 stars no doubt !
This place is busy so be ready for the wait , wait to make the order , wait for the table , wait for the food .... you basically have to go and find your own seats because there is no one to seat you .
Tea was tasteless and was not fresh .
I sure do not like giving not so great reviews .
The very very veeeeerrrrry disappointing part was , the person who worked with me did not ask me hardly any questions .
What 's is your main purpose for coming ( yes i know it 's on the questionnaire when you check in but if your not asked and or the survey is not followed up in the one on one session , what 's the point of the questionnaire .? )
The person working with me did not tell me she was leaving anything , no suggestions nor did she come and explain why she left what she left at the counter .
Being my first time , i was not told after procedure things i can or can not do .
What to eat or not eat .
I felt like a movie that was going so good and fell off at the end with no conclusion or understanding of what just happened .
I am not saying i will not go back but i sure in the heck need to be educated .
My tummy is upset and not sure why .
Because i was not given any after care instructions , i ate soup for lunch and a salad for dinner .
No matter what you pay for the service , i feel that i did not get what i paid for .
I do not know if it was an ethnicity issue or something else .
Maybe she did not know what to do for the customer .
I could not tell you !
I bought a product bud i 'd not leave a tip because i should not of had to ask the questions , i should have been informed by my nurse , consultant or what ever you want to call her .
Comparing the regular pho and satay pho side by side ( disclosure : i did not eat both phos - my mom ordered the regular pho ) the regular pho tasted very , very , very , very , very bland .
I was asked to be part of a commercial shoot for the food network , so last minute i decided to make an apt here so i would not have to deal with my own hair .
Treated like a king , food quality did not disappoint .
Other than that though the quality was definitely there , could tell they do not cheap out in ingredients .
However , the service is poor and was not friendly .
Many of our dishes ordered did not arrive .
I would not recommend this restaurant .
Not a big fan of afghani food but i think there chapli kabob is the best .
My taste buds curled from disappoint as my stomach did not even give me a comfort feeling .
The ginger was not good , the seaweed was not fresh and the size of the rolls were small .
So i folded my container , gave a formal apology to my stomach , tongue and promised my heart never to return .
For starters , the restaurant is incredibly large , so do not be afraid to bring a group .
My husband and i have never once had slow or bad service .
It 's nice when you are at breakfast and your coffee does not get cold bc they are always quick to refill it .
Both of us opted for their ayce sushi $ 24.99 weekend price which is not all too bad .
Run for the hills , never eat here if you like quality food !
Went at about 11 a.m. and there was about a 20 - minute wait .. not too bad .
I am not a big fan of sweet type of food for breakfast ( which is a shame , because they had some amazing - sounding options ) , so i got the kielbasa scrambler , and it was very good .
I do not know .
Which is fine , because it 's all about the food , but this is not somewhere i 'd go and feel totally comfortable , personally .
Always friendly and happy to make special orders the way you like them or they will keep trying until they get it right at no cost to you ... also they open at 4 am when most others are nt open til 5
Cue music : " she was a one - fork , one - knife , shrewd pretentious pizza eater ... " hate to crash the 5 - star pizza party here , buuut ... pizza is a personal thing , and personally , pizza pino 's is not my favourite .
What i did not like : personal taste again , but the sauce is a specific brand used at some pizza places that has a bitterness to it , and they are a bit heavy - handed for my liking ; their usual amount of cheese is a lot of cheese , so it does not melt into the other toppings but instead kinda lays on top like a stretchy blanket .
I complained to the cashier but he had an attitude and did not seem to care .
The food was ok but definitely not worth $ 27.95 .
I will not be returning .
No need to dab oil off these slices .
Not so much for the decorating and interior of the place , which honestly , is not all that hot but because the food is just delicious .
These apps are very small portions but it 's just one of those " value added " treats that a lot of places do not bother making the effort to do for the customers .
The interior is nice , not very special , and easy on the eyes .
It was a little loud , however , i loved it and can not wait to go back .
Despite the weather , it 's still a place you have to try - not just for the pool , but for the views and ambiance too .
Ordered the sardine bahn mi and could not stop smiling .
Removed 1 star because few times i went at 8:30 pm , the chef has stop cooking even though the restaurant closes at 9 pm. and a couple of times , the curry sauce was not up to their usually standard ( ie. the sauce was not thick enough or it did not have that malaysian curry flavor )
We ordered the appetizer sashimi ( big enough as a single entree ) , seaweed salad ( a generous amount was served ) , the tuna trio ( delicious ) , and the usual rainbow roll which did not disappoint either .
Not sure how shannon can do what she does with my hair but i love her .
You 'd pass it easily if you were not looking for it .
The atmosphere was relaxed ( a monday lunchtime ) , with no crazy line ups .
Terrible customer service , rude staff , over charging , mixing orders , every time i order bolani they do not have it , so why have it in the menu ?
Naans are usually dry and stale and reheated the next day , no fixed time to open , last time we waited 10 minutes outside after 12 noon , hours of business are not posted on front door .
I will not go back .
I am not a sushi expert by any means - much of my experience comes from krab sushi found on many buffets in the area .
And then there are places with things on their sushi that i am not really sure that i would like to eat if i knew what was on the plate , so it is not often that we go out seeking sushi .
When it comes to sushi , you can order a number of items , and i will not pretend to know what is what .
Not just what you order , but complimentary tasting dishes as well .
Well worth the trip , even if you are not in the area .
Vaccines are not over priced .
Only 1 person had been here before , so he did the ordering and the rest of us had no idea what we were getting ourselves into .
I 'd only had afghani food once before and it was not in kabab form , so i did not know what to expect .
The chicken had a yellow colouring , making it look like curry , but it was not .
Only a couple people could handle it .... i was not one of them . :(
The other kababs looked the same , but were not .
If you are not sure about something , just ask .
It 's a beautiful place , i would not mind going there for a meal now that i know what to order !
These guys are also pretty good but i felt their chicken was super oily left a trail of oil on my rice .. and was not a fan of their sauce plus chicken was spicier .. did not taste like a true afghani restaurant like bamiyaan does .
These guys are also pretty good but i felt their chicken was super oily left a trail of oil on my rice .. and was not a fan of their sauce plus chicken was spicier .. did not taste like a true afghani restaurant like bamiyaan does .
Not very pleasing to the palate .
I approached the person who put our order through and she told me our order did not go through because we did not pay .
She said " i know i am sorry " they should have approached us and told us that our food order did not go through while we were the only people in the store not after 4 orders came and gone .
We can not wait to go back , it will be very soon !!
The quality of the sushi and other items are really good compared to other all you can eat sushi restaurants however the service is not the most consistent .
Quick and easy check in , they do not take your drivers license or make you fill out paperwork .
Is not going to stop you .
They tell you when you are allowed to shoot or not because they can not let people just walk out and change targets when other people are still shooting , everyone has to go at the same time .
I do not see this as a hassle , just common sense .
You will never leave here hungry ( huge portions ) .
It was not busy on a sunday noon .
This would never happen to me at the other places .
I am not a big eater and normally the regular bowl filled me up !
My 2 stars was based on the quantity of my food and experience i received and not over quality .
The food was good , but not as good as it should be for the location and price .
I stood in the entrance way for six minutes and not one employee came over .
I am not totally sure that they did a " deep cond treatment " but the rest was right on .
Used to come here all the time when i had more friends living in mississauga but they all moved down to toronto so we do not go much anymore .
All the meat skewers / teriyaki comes with a delicious sauce and we always get the soft shell crab , not many sushi places have that .
Whenever we finally made it inside , it was not what i had expected but in a good way .
The size of the pita was pretty large and i knew that by the time i was finished that i would not need anything else .
No refills on drinks though !
I have not tried the omelets yet , but they are huge and look great .
There was just a waitress that worked and served for all people . second , it 's turkish restaurant with turkish menu but the waitress can not speak turkish .
I do not always write reviews but i thought this little business deserved one and a good one .
Very welcoming place and people too , very clean , well presented , they basically sell vietnamese sandwiches and it 's not that pricey too , i am vietnamese myself and i have eaten quite a few and for the price , the banh mi are very good , they do not cheap out on the stuffing , it 's prepared on the spot and you do not see any sandwiches ready for sell on the counter so you know it 's always fresh .
There 's also a 30 % rebate after 9 p.m on some products that need to be sold as soon as possible such as sushi , spring rolls and other stuff i can not remember that can not be preserved for too long .
In short , this will be the perfect place for me whenever i will need a lunch to go and i do not have time to make it myself !
I am not huge on breakfast sweets but i still very much enjoyed my swedish pancakes , and i thought it was cool to try something different besides your typical chocolate chip or blueberry hotcakes .
We were in and out of there pretty quickly , but we did go late on a weekday morning so i am not sure what the wait is like during peak hours .
It 's not significantly more expensive than chain pizza but blows them all away in quality .
What was really telling is , " extra " or " double " cheese is not offered as an option .
You will not need it ....
If you are tired of gta chain pizza where the sauce and cheese are applied with a spray gun , but are also not a fan of thin crust so - called " gourmet " hype with stupid toppings ( i hate that cpk - style crap ) , try pino 's .
6:15 in the drivethru ordered two hot chocolates and waited over 10 minutes to get to the window and the guy working the window tells me i do not have an order for you with an attitude .
I do not just get into a starbucks line to sit and wait order ten minutes because i have nothing better to do with my time kindly i replied i did order two hot chocolates but if you can not locate the order you have it now . this location needs better organization
No but seriously , thank you yelpers for helping me find this great bakery and restaurant .
I am new to lebanese food , have not had much exposure yet , but we tried and we loved !
My only regret is not ordering the full plate , will definitely be stopping here regularly .
Space is limited , and with that said if you want a place to study this is not the place .
Yes , you can discharge weapons in a designated direction at this facility , that alone is worth 5 stars , assuming the range officers were not sarcastic and condescending , and assuming you could use the rest of the range without being part of some club or group .
Safety is important and risk will never be eliminated but this place takes the cake in reference to simply tuning people off with their delivery .
What people do not realize about talking down to groups of people based on the actions of a few is that the groups of people rotate constantly therefore sending mixed messages to those who have just arrived . anyway , triggers can be pulled here ... but paper is the only thing you can shoot , and long distance or anything else that is common among shooters for the last 100 years is not allowed .

I have not purchased from this dealership yet , but i was very impressed with the customer service , attitude and knowledge of our salesman , michael , during our test drive of the mazda cx 5 . first he introduced himself to our kids also , which is surprisingly rare .
Then he pulled the two models of interest to us in the parking spaces right outside so we did not have to walk all over the lot .
He showed me all the features on the car , but was not at all pushy .
We drove one model with him in the car and he was not overly chatty , which was great .
Then he let our family drive another model alone since there was not quite room for five .
I have not decided yet on a make and model , but if i do go with the mazda cx 5 or the hyundai santa fe , i will certainly call michael first to try and make a deal .
I was worried it would be awkward but that was not at all the case .
I grew up in toronto , now live in the us east coast , even ate banh mi in vietnam - and vua ranks very close to the top banh mi i have ever had ( so take my review seriously because i am not some clueless american tourist who is new to banh mi ) .
Service : very friendly and the vietnamese staff not only speak vietnamese , they can take your order in french and english .
One day i came in right at opening time and was told by the cashier that sandwiches were not yet available , but when she saw our disappointment she went back and called the kitchen staff to have them make us sandwiches .
This ai not your typical lazy banh mi shop in north america that uses bottled soy sauce and acts stingy on pate content .
This means your sandwich will drip an oozy mixture of mayo and soy sauce so watch your clothing , but do not despair - only the most legit banh mi will drip in this manner .
No deli meats here , just a massive gob of pate along with the pickled vegetables .
Not under-cooked and not dry .
Chapman always serviced car well without " selling " other services not needed and when recommended work was offered they were understanding of financial situation and recommended on priorities .
Just going by the bahn mi , i am never coming here again .
The bread is too large and there 's no crispy crust .
There is not enough pickled veggies to add the refreshing crunch .
Not that adding more would have helped , they were soft , rather tasteless , and sad .
I do not understand how anything can be soooo good .
I do not even care if it 's a cold day or not , i can eat this in like scorching heat and still be happy .
The pho here is not bad either .
The broth does not seem 100 % legit viet , but i have had worst and the portions here are supreme for the prices .
However , do not order the chicken skewers .
They came right when i was about to pay the bill and i did not want to ask them to take it back ... they were sooo dry and tasted a little funky .
I have not been back in a while and i am kicking myself for it .
When winter comes , i am going to be supporting this place like no other .
Unfortunately we will no longer be going to the pancake house .
My husband wanted to order a few things a la carte as they did not have exactly what he wanted .
Our section was about half full and it was not super busy .
She never came back .
At the register we asked to speak to the manager and we waited for another 20 minutes but no manager appeared .
Chapman mazda 's price was the best in the valley and the transaction could not have been better .
I appreciate the no pressure attitude of the sales team .
I have been through the drive - thru as well and it can be a bit slow , but not nearly as slow as some others i have been to .
No complaints from me .
I almost did not go , because samuel had such a negative review .
It 's a shooting range , not too much to say about it .
There would be no other reason that i come here .
Instant single star , never returning .
So looks like these guys will not be some fly by night deli that plagues la centreville .
Unfortunately , the system does not work very well on a busy saturday night .
The cashier did not even inform us that the wait - time was going to be that long !
They do not have an actual coffee menu but they do offer a full espresso service .
As it turned out , it was ok , not that great .
Rob riley was such a great guy and there was never any pressure to buy !
Thank you bill lohmeyer for your assistance , no - pressure , caring , knowledgeable , caring demeanor .
Now we just need to think of a name for our new ride ( i name all of my cars , do not judge me ) ...
If you have the taste for authentic turkish cousins then look no further .
Do not forget the deserts .
But only one group is allowed to use it , and they do not use it , let alone allow you to .
I think it 's a little bit too expensive for the location ( south oakland , student residental area ) , but if you are not a poor student you can spoil yourself from time to time with delicious korean food .
Most starbucks personnel are friendly , do not expect that as compared to other starbucks in the area here .
I can not tell you how many times somebody has " accidentally taken my or someone else 's order " .
Actually it was never made .
Otherwise , coming to this one would not be an option .
Definitely not going to be my last time here .
Even the dishes did not taste well .
I am going to keep this short and somewhat rant free because if i do not i will be writing a novel instead of a review .
I have never , in all my years , been spoken to with such utter disrespect .
I barely said a word throughout the process and yet i was spoken to as though i could not even get the name portion correct on an iq test .
They acted as though i could not comprehend simple words and phrases despite my prompt and polite responses .
Why on god 's green earth you 'd want to treat a paying customer like that i have no idea , and i really do not care - there is no excuse for it .
I can not believe this person has not been fired yet , as i assume he speaks to other customers in this same manner , not to mention subordinates , colleagues , co-workers , etc . if you are upper management and you are reading this , do not take my word for it , listen in on the next few people who come in and see the kind of customer service your customers are getting .

Second issue : everything about the process was dishonest , from the sham " high tech " warranty that covers exactly nothing , to the internet discount , the fees , the quality and stability of the car ( i have had to take it in to an actually reputable auto shop 3 times for various issues ) , to the finance company that puts so many road blocks in your way for issues you have that you will never get your issues resolved .
Ever. bottom line - never purchase or finance a car from these people , they will absolutely screw you over and will not even attempt to fix it .
There are ranges for not only pistols , but high powered rifles , shotguns , and even bows and arrows .
... i do not want know you name , i just want bang bang bang .
Not a lot to say other than it was about as easy as buying a car could be . the car had previous hail damage , but i could not find any evidence of this at all and i am pretty picky .
Not a lot to say other than it was about as easy as buying a car could be . the car had previous hail damage , but i could not find any evidence of this at all and i am pretty picky .
Not sure how dealers are reimbursed for hail damaged cars , but it must be generous !
I feel like i have to be on guard at this step of buying a car as the guy behind the desk makes his living selling people things they do not always need .
When i walked in , i told the finance guy i do not buy warranties , etc , and please just let me write my check and be on my way .
No pressure at all to buy anything !
There was no pressure at all .
Frankly , i can put up with dealer bs for a super deal , but at chapman there was not bs at all and the price was great too .
I could not believe it when henry offered to pick up the car from our home , leave a loaner , then return the car when it was fixed !
I know chapman can not do this sort of thing all the time , but i thought it was a remarkable display of customer service .
I am smacking myself i could not bring home a ginormous cooler full of these vietnamese sub -like sandwiches and freeze them : one for each day .
Not very big on the inside , but their 's more seating in the fast - casual joint right above them .
I can not wait to try other things on the menu .
It was not as good as the first two times .
The first , which , out of courtesy , i will not name , essentially tried to " steal " our trade in .
Never going back
The broth is really favoured , not salty .
Btw , no lunch special ...
Please do not sit near the little opening where the wait staff pick up the food .
You will have a view of the kitchen ..( which i prefer not to see ) .
It 's not that good .
It 's not terrible , but it definitely comes around 2.5 / 3 stars for tastiness in the bahnmi department .
The sushi was ok , nothing out of the ordinary definitely not something that will bring me back to this place , the hibachi lunch was horrible , my chicken and veggies were swimming on oil , so was my husbands steak and shrimp and the " fried rice " was not fried rice at all it looked like rice cooked on beef broth for some color , needles to say i am suffering from the worse heartburn case i had in a few weeks .
I would not go back :(
Anyway , my group of colleagues is only going to keep growing and sadly it looks like i will not be able to bring them here anytime soon for our monthly socials .
I can no longer ignore how amazing i feel and how much i have learned about nutrition and toxins .
Not labeled " food " products , nor processed " frankenfoods " .
Not only the actual process of the hydrotherapy is on point ... tommy was able to guide me to making sure i take at least a 10 strain proabotic daily ( which my expensive one at home was only 8 ! ) and to also suggest adding some other tools from herbally grounded that i was not familiar with .

I can not wait for my next session .
Be aware this is a life commitment not " a flush and back up with mcdeath " type of program .
Located by leslie and 16th , this place was not too hard to find .
There were no windows or pillars that blocked the outside view of the plaza .
I was not expecting much , as this is my second time coming here .
There was not enough garlic in both the chicken or the sauce , so that was a disappointment .
Do not take up my review and not try this place , though .
I come here bc it 's a minute away from work , when i do not feel like driving .
I did not even let her finish the makeup .
Never ever going there again .
My hair is not as great as before but my issue lies in the check out .
I knew this did not expect the deal .
But on it i read price you paid does not .
Said they do not do that !
Definitely not for formal dining , but if you are into grabbing a quick tasty bite lunch or dinner , this is one of the best ones in the area .
It had us reaching for a glass of milk ( we are not really into super spicy foods / dips ) to quench the flames our taste buds were experiencing .
Have not tried bamiyan kebab yet , but i have a friend who has recommended it .
I am not usually one to write reviews immediately but this place was so good , especially for an ayce establishment .
I thought the miso soup was good , wings looked crispy , but the coconut shrimp was over- battered and the tempura had no flavour .
Definitely would not recommend any of the drinks - everything tastes super watered down .
Apparently the service here is infamous ( downright rude ) , and i would not disagree - it really is awful .
Can not think of any reasons for me to suggest that anyone come to green lemon grass , but i can come up with a whole bunch to avoid it !
Not into a sandwich ?
Their ddeokbokki is mediocre , the ddeok is rather hard and flavor just is not amazing .
They do not skimp on any of the toppings .
If you are a new yorker and used to dollar slices , you sadly will not find that here .
Not bad but between the meat and fries i felt my fingers full of salt .
Staff is friendly and food is hot but this will not replace my favorite local greek spots .
No opa here !
The portions are big , but the price is not exactly cheap .
A regular bowl of pho is served in huge bowls and it s not uncommon to see a group of 2 - 3 with their tables full of plates .
Knowing the price of my veggies , i would not pay $ 8 for a plate of blanched veggies .
The stir fried green beans did not disappoint .
Tastes amazing , and not expensive for the amount and quality of the meats .
I never had a problem with long lines like the other people who go in the morning ( as i stop by everyday on the way to work around late afternoon lol , yeah i know lucky me right ? :p )
I had no issues with the service .
I did not like their ordinary link sausage , latte or corned beef hash .
No taste .
I would not call this a sangria .
When i made it clear that his joke was not funny , he told me it will be another few minutes .
I will not be coming back .
There were 2 wait staff that kept telling our group that they needed the table back at 9 p.m ..... it was 7 p.m. not to mention that the restaurant was half empty ... even less than that .
I strongly do not recommend this restaurant at this point .
I am a younger gal and maybe they profiled me as one who has poor credit or does not know what she 's doing , but that 's not the case .
Well , after declining the offer and leaving a message on the sales manager 's phone early afternoon i had a phone call from the sales manager at 9:30 pm acting like he never got my message .
To top it all off , i put a $ 500 deposit to hold the car while i slept on it and a week later , the credit still has not been filed .
Very , very disappointed with the experience and i would never advise to buy from this dealership .
We ordered : belachan shrimp and green beans ( soft , well cooked , tasty ) spring rolls ( yum ! ) roti canai ( a little more oily than i like , but it 's roti ! ) curry minced chicken roti ( tasty , spicier than the other curry dish we ordered ) malaysian curry beef brisket ( very tasty ) bbq chicken and spring roll vermicelli ( i am not usually a vermicelli fan , but this was tasty mixed with the curry ) we came here on a wednesday night with a group of 4 and there was no wait .
But now i do not have to !
I can not that kind hospitality at most restaurants where they charge far more .
To say this is the best korean place in pittsburgh would not be fair .
In any event , if you are looking for korean food , this place is not bad .
It 's a small quaint little place so you 'd probably pass by here and not even know it .
Nope. did not get it right and used milk .
I am not sure it it 's new management or new cooks but the quality and the especially the presentation of the food has gotten terrible .
The last 3 times i we nt i was presented with spicy tuna rolls that were not even rolled !
The tuna was falling out everywhere , did not look appetizing or appealing .
Also a huge fan of the yaki udon noodles , but those as well were undercooked and the veggies were still hard not soft .
Staff is nice & friendly but i just can not come back .
Not only is this a great retail store to buy middle eastern items you might not be able to find elsewhere , the prepared food is delicious .
These are perfectly fried shoe strings with a sprinkle of something like paprika ... i am not sure , but it was really nice .
The rules are not there to hamper your fun but to protect your life , so please respect them and do not be a dummy .
Omelette was atrociously overcooked and would not have been served by anyone who knows what one is supposed to look like .
I have not been into the store since the remodel .
If you have not been there in a while , go back , you will not be disappointed .
I do not know where to begin .
They have a lot of middle eastern grocery items that you can not find any where else in the area .
I would not mind going back here , but i have been to better restaurants that i have felt fully comfortable and content at .
The decor is nice what with it s fountains and chandeliers , but one thing i was not happy about whatsoever was that when i was chewing a piece of kebab , i felt something hard in my mouth .
I do not know if it is a piece of the grinder , but i hope that if i do go back here , this will not happen again or to anyone else for that matter .
He made it fun and not scary .
I am a pizza fiend ; this place loads up so much topping and so much cheese .. i can not imagine what would happen if u ordered extra cheese .
It 's not pizza pino .
I drive from bowmanville on sundays and am never disappointed .
Lol as long as you are not behind the person ordering for the whole office then you are good .
I asked for extra butter when i did get my meal and waitress never brought it .
Not as pricey as i expected .
It was not overly sweet , and flavor was perfectly balanced with other fruits .
The other one was good too , but not as impressive as coconut pancakes .
P.s. we did not get any birthday treats as we notified it was a birthday brunch when we were making the reservation .
Just probably not on birthday .
Do not be fooled by their exterior - tucked away in south oakland , behind the simple storefront is the most authentic korean food you will find in the city !
Sandwiches were well made , fast , and did not cost too much .
Got most of the toppings but no avocado this time .
They do not get a thumbs up for putting my bowl together but no big deal as i mix the whole thing anyway .
I could not finish it so i saved it for the next day .
Not bad .
The other places give miso soup so that sucks they do not offer extras like that .
For as awkward as this experience could be , it really was not bad at all .
2 . ordered 2 meat. it ( raw ) came out brownish looking , not fresh .
We did paid for that , did not we ?
No over head big vent hood like all other bbq places does .
You do not even get a whole crab , just half .
9 . group of 4 ( three were not big eater ) .
10. one of us ask for hot tea . waiter replay : we do not have tea .
This is the 1st ( and hope last ) time a asian restaurant i been to where it does not have tea .
If you have no taste buds and have extra money that you do not care .
They said no , then the man at the stand said it was fine and sat the women at a table .
I could not believe it .
When we sat at the bar my boyfriend said it because we were not dressed nice enough .
A group of people were walking out of the elevator and they went up to the stand and said they did not have reservations , they again , were sat at a table .
We will never go back .
Do not come to pizza pino unless you are famished .
Not only is the food delicious but the servings are more than most people can eat in one sitting .
The fact that every ginormous pie is made to other and it does n't sit under a hot lamp waiting to be sneezed on .
Pffffft , you must not be familiar with my posts then .
The not so great was the first band that played ... the music was entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant , and you had to yell at the person next to you to hear them at a whisper like level .
I was told they usually do not refill that medication and would have to get vet approval ( who was out that day ) and they would call me back in the morning .
I called back wednesday afternoon because i had not heard back and was told the same thing by a different person .
It 's now saturday and still no call backs .
The retsuarant is very fancy and coulerful and has a great feeling to it but the food and prices on the otherhand were not so great and expensive for normal food
There is no actual glass so you can hop over if you wanted to .
A bit pricy for extra roti and the extra sauce was not even needed .
The beef was tender but not fall off the bone quality and once again the curry sauce is lacking in flavor .
I never imagined that i 'd be sitting here writing a review about colon therapy but i am in total agreement with the others ' reviews .
Just bought the galbi which is expensive in general but i literally got no meat for $ 33 .
The patio was not open at this time .
Do not go here !
I wanted to not worry about doing it on my own .
She spun the chair away from the mirror for the entire appointment , so i never got to see what she was doing ( issue # 1 ) .
Then she spun back around , and said " okay , you are all finished . " my hair did not look finished .
It looked ratty and not elegant for a nice christmas party .
I said , it did not look finished and that many parts looked like they needed to be combed .
She did not even know i had booked the appointment with hot tools ( bad communication with front desk and hair person - issue # 2 ) .
I question this stylists taste level & hated that i had to pick apart the hair - do , so i did not leave in tears .
Also , at home was the only place i was able to actually see my hair , because she never even gave me a mirror to check out the back of my hair ( issue # 4 ) .
She wanted to get the job done and did not care at all about the actual hairstyle . issue # 5 -- worst part is , i completed their survey online that they send to clients , explaining how unhappy i was with the service i received .
No one ever contacted me about my unhappy trip ... which led me to fill out this awful review on yelp .
What 's the point of sending out surveys if you do not actually do anything about it .
Must be nice to get paid extra to be a boss , manager , etc . but never have to actually do anything extra except order some supplies and schedule employees .
After checking out yelp , it seems as though no one from this company even looks at what customers are saying because there are a lot of unhappy people out there & obviously the problems have no been fixed .
Bottomline - book an appointment way in advance for the blow dry bar at scottsdale quarter & do not waste your time with a business who does not appreciate their customers or their employees ( if the employees were happier , they would probably do a better job & care ) .
Easily my favorite pizza here in the city and dare i say i am not sure i have had a better slice anywhere else in my travels around the globe .
Just came before 530 pm so was not that busy no lineup but lineup started after 6 pm. filet mignon was delicious and worth a second trip .
This particular neighborhood is one i do not get to much , so since business brought me here i figured i 'd come early and grab breakfast / lunch .
Not many choices for breakfast along brookline blvd .
Do not listen to the review in which the restaurant was described as being " ghetto " .
Sushi was good but i am disappointed they do not have the rose sushi .
The sushi was average but they did not have a large selection .
Sushi was average but not outstanding and memorable .
Would not recommend to a friend .
It does not look like much from the outside , but it 's a family - run , authentic korean restaurant where the experience is in the food -- not in the decor .
Unlike green pepper in squirrel hill , it 's not overpriced .
I went a few months back and although i only went once , there is no way i am going back .
First off , it was freezing inside the restaurant so that did not help with the experience .
Fluffy not oily .
Love this place and the stylist that work here are all excellent however booking on the phone is very difficult as they have now hired someone with an accent i assume russian and i can not understand her , we go back and forth and she asks me to repeat everything and i ask her to repeat also .
Service is quite slow but the food is delicious and the view is definitely one that does not do justice in photos .
There are many sub options to choose from so you will not get fed up .
Can not go wrong with viet iced coffee either .
Everything was great , but i was a little disappointed in a few things : no juice or tea , my egg was overcooked , and there were only 2 banchan dishes .
Firstly , if you are coming here for the view and atmosphere you will not be disappointed .
They were so accommodating , found a spot i could put my boxes , even though i was not staying at the hotel .
If you are not shy you can have one of your own after ( which we did -- have you seen that view ? ) .
I had the tofu dinner , not expecting too much because the place seemed more " aesthetics " oriented .
I am no tofu expert , but just coming back from shanghai , i was impressed it was up to par to chinese counterparts .
Since me and one of my friends had never tried korean bbq before , we decided to order the pork belly version to share ( $ 27 ) .
Our waitress did not stop by our table once after our food arrived .
Our waters remained unfilled , and the banchan that came with the kbbq were not replenished , which should be standard , according to my friend who visited s. korea .
The crust is a good balance between being not too thin , nor too thick or stodgy .
The sauce and cheese is plenty , and toppings are not stingily laid .
Staff were friendly , not too intrusive , but aware enough of when drinks needed topping up , and to bring take home boxes .
45 minutes for food at lunch hour is not acceptable .... the service is much better at bamiyan
Do not fall for their $ 20 unlimited sushi / hibachi trap .
I deducted one star for not having singaporean pepper crab or curry crab , or curry fish head soup .
Not enough thai dishes either .
Not a very big fan of the self service style which takes away from the restaurant experience .
I have been to and my first experience was not the best .
The food does not typically take too long to cook and the portions are very generous .
Also , do not get too full with the naan .
For that reason , it was a comfortable environment to be eating lunch alone and not be disturbed with lots of noise .
I ordered the bulgogi and was not disappointed .
He got me an outstanding deal on my 2016 mazda 3 touring with no hassle .
They all stopped by and offered their help in a non-threatening and polite manner and even used their own credits to not waste ours ' during the instruction .
The range officers always seem to be cranky and also generally not friendly .
They are unfamiliar with their weapons or downright do not care .
From what i understand they are all volunteers but that is no excuse .
If you can not check your attitude at the door and do not enjoy what you are doing , do not do it .
Went with a group on nine for a sunday birthday dinner and will definitely not return .
The server tried to make a joke and it was not well received .
They could have had the decency to give it to us on the house in order to redeem themselves , but sadly they did not .
Would not recommend , there are other restaurants with better service , better food , and a better view .
But i am probably the only person on this page who did not like the pizza .
Far too much cheese , crust is way too thick , and we just did not enjoy it .
Will never order from there again
The fish is not fresh .
I have 50 tramadol pills i can not use .
My former vet asked me what meds i had at home before giving me more , and only gave me as many as i would need , not 20 or 30 tablets to recover from a single procedure and then a new prescription every time i come in .
They told me on one visit that they could not prescribe rimadyl because my dog has liver issues , and then a different vet went ahead and prescribed rimadyl on the next visit .
It s always a different vet , no consistency .
I am not even going to let these people take the cast off my dog 's broken leg .
No trust left .
I have never had anything bad here ... prepared food , service , or food from the grocery .
I could not be happier !
I was not comfortable with that because we did not see it happen .
It was our first time there so that impression was not the best .
There was tons of middle eastern grocery stuff , mostly focused on lebanese brands as that where the owner is originally from but there was so much other grocery stuff on the shelves that i did not recognize .
We sampled lovely freshly made hummus and feta which tasted gorgeous - the only thing they did not have was camel - milk chocolate , but who knows that might be coming soon .
There are not really any other coffee shops near this location , and they move the line pretty quick .
Will miss this place when i no longer go back to canada !
I have been to this place numerous times and have never left disappointed i would highly recommend this to anyone i know .
But more than anything , kost provides a dining experience - not necessarily one that is constrained to the quality of its food .
We tried their yakitori shrimp ( great size ) and the shrimp was actually firm and not soggy like most places .
I am not eating that and i told the waiter why but i did not get an apology .
Not a good start ...... so the unagi roll came , not bad .
Not a good start ...... so the unagi roll came , not bad .
The sashimi came , the rare material is fresh but the cutting is bad , the white tuna is not cut equally .
I do not go out to this area often , but got a recommendation to eat here from the nearby toyota dealership .
Today i really had worse experience i do not think i will ever want to go again .
The rates which are displayed are not the same what they billed .
The staff who take the order will not bother about the customer service anymore .
Since they are huge lineups for the food they do not need to be attentive .
There were no spoons or knives to eat .
I do not think if the management is not talking care of this things soon they will lose loyal customers like me .
They will not have line ups anymore .
I would not give them any stars if i had the choice .
My husband called at 830 am that day to cancel the reservation as the city of toronto was experiencing an ice storm and was on an extreme storm watch and was told not to leave your house .
The manager told us she was going to charge our credit card 25 $ per person for cancelling less the 24 hours , even though mother nature was not on our side and it was not safe to be on the roads .
We asked a waitress if we could get served and she rudely told us she was not serving our table .
She came back 5 minutes reiterating that she was not our server but will do us a favour and punch in our food , but we did not need any favours and decided to leave .
Behind her were at least 6 other servers also eating enjoying their meals while we were not .
Does kost or bisha not provide breaks or areas to eat for their staff ?
The desk staff was not friendly , did not greet me when walking in and then i had to ask for a beverage ( not offered ) .
1 . take - out charge ( 50 cents ) - although this is not much , i have never heard of a place that charges something that is part of their business expense !
No other restaurant charges this type of fee for something customers can not finish .
2 . does not accept credit card - only debit cards and cash .
It 's bad enough that they do not take credit cards and do not even tell customers in advanced but to charge customers for using debit card as well ??
Honestly , i have never been to any restaurants that have this type of money - grabbing business practice as a way to boost their revenue .
Vermicelli is not really authentic .
I ended up giving her two bucks but am never coming back to this place again .
No one seemed to know what they were doing , my friends stylists were friendly but the girl who did my hair never smiled and barely said 2 words to me .
She kept burning my head with the blow dryer and did not seemed concerned with what i wanted but rather getting me out her chair as soon as she could .
She never offered me a magazine , ipad or a drink as my other friends were given mimosas and were offered other things .
We all ended up not liking our hair and re-doing it before going out and could persoanlly all do our own hair much better than they did !
So glad we did not pay full price ( luckily we had groupons ) and we will never be back !
The service was not really good .
The ingredients were pretty fresh , and they do not skimp out on ingredients .
They gave us the breads from yesterday we could not even eat the breads with our kababs .
The money you pay is a lot and you can not even enjoy your food .
2 . the range master picks out your shooting bench for you , not the other way around .
3 . there are no sand bags or rests provided .
5 . there 's no wind protection out here from the winds that plague north phoenix this time of year .
Do not get me wrong , it s a great facility , but it s not five stars worth of the greatest facility .
I have not tried a whole lot of poke places , but the ingredients here are fresh and the flavors are good .
It was empty , which is never a good sign .
I took my food to go and as soon as i got to the car i could not help but to dig in .
Not to mention they guy working there was so patient , friendly and most of all very helpful with the menu .
The food was delicious and no complaints what 's so ever .
Overall i have to stay i am beyond impressed with the awesome way they run the restaurant not to mention it was very clean .
I can not wait to come back in the summer when the patio is open .
The staff were courteous , but also not very attentive .
The sushi was definitely not fresh and the assembly and presentation were lacking appeal .
Operators should be careful when selecting restaurant names and not have the ability to live up to them .
Not the best banh mi i have ever had but the sandwiches are delicious and have some complex flavours .
I did not have high hopes for the original pancake house but i was pleasantly surprised .
I can not wait to go back !
Could not even finish it all , i was so full !
I bought the pb -8 probiotics and seriously will not need to visit hw for a few more months .
We had no idea this place had popped up .
One of the staff was not sure how to define some of the sauces and another staff did not know that his " favorite juice " was passion fruit .
Why not go to the original pancake house if you have a choice between the two ?
If they are not amish , they still give you a quality feel .
The booths are huge and eating in this place definitively will not leave you feeling desperate for your space to enjoy the time and meal there .
Most of the time i find myself there on a weekend though when the specials are not offered .
Pancakes are a no brainer , but all you get is pancakes unless you pay for a side of something else .
I have had so many of the special pancakes i can not decide which is my favorite .
I can not say i have ever been disappointed though .
I am all about fresh squeezed , but there must be something about the oranges they use or maybe i just do not like pulp , but it 's never what i am looking for .
The coffee , however , is great and you will not have any trouble taking down several cups of that .
Do not sit at the table with your card out waiting for the waitress to take it for you .
When he stopped to take it in to have it fixed they did not apologize and had an attitude about fixing it .
I love my starbucks and would not have cared about the wait as much if we did not have to deal with teenage girl attitude .
Everything was right , the ambiance is what you expect a pizza place to be , the crust was perfect , the ingredients were fresh , the wait was not too bad and the service was friendly .
The four of us shared a pie , no rush , we chatted , and left satisfied .
Bland to the point of tasting stale , i did not consume any more past the initial sampling .
This restaurant would not survive in new york city 's koreatown , but i was just glad to find some korean food in pittsburgh .
After i came in , no more customers came in .
There was no service between the time my food got to me and the time i asked for the check .
They did not even bother come over to see if i needed anything , or if the other table needed anything .
Not the best , but satisfies a craving .
Can not remember my stylist 's name but he did take the extra time to using hot tools even when i said i did not need any as it was not any special occasion .
As my hair is asian fine he said as a perfectionist he could not allow me to leave not perfectly satisfied !
We did not even try the tacos because - $ 35-45 for tacos ?!?!
I do not know what they were thinking .
The server dropped the wine at the table and rushed on , not asking or giving us a chance to say we were ready to order .
No attempt at presentation .
I could not eat more than one serving because of the smell .
I would have returned the tartare to the kitchen if we had had any level of service checking in on us but we ate our meal with no one even asking if we were enjoying it .
Even the view and decor could not draw me back when i could have much better taco / mexican a 5 - 10 minute walk away that would include margaritas for under $ 100 .
No high pressure sales , no dog and pony show .
This does not leave a lot of give room if someone 's hair is long , or they want hot tools such as a curling iron , etc ( which cost an extra $ 10 !!!!! absurd ) .
I was not late .
It is not my problem that they only book 1 hour for hair and makeup ) ; they only have 2 chairs for makeup so if more than 2 people are getting that done then we have to sit in a low circular couch thing meant as a waiting area ; the blow dryers hanging from the ceiling are a nice touch except the one on the end was not staying up and kept hitting the client in the head ; the surprise $ 10 for the hairdresser touching a curling iron ( which she neglected to inform me about and just did it even when i said she could just curl my hair with a round brush and dryer ) ; the makeup done was rushed and horrible , i had to keep asking her to add stuff because it seemed like she just wanted to finish and get me out of there .
Needless to say i will not be back .
Environment - smaller and intimate with pretty basic table set - ups ... no sectioned off booths like at prince steakhouse in etobicoke .
So glad they move in so close to the house ; no need to cook anymore !
The staff was friendly , the restaurant was clean , the menu had all the best greek dishes and the prices were reasonable too ... so , what 's not to like ?
I think they have a parking lot too but i have never been to it .
I made the reservation through the website , it was pretty easy and i showed up and the guy who did my hair was really nice , too bad i can not remember his name .
I am pretty easy going and i was not having any special event , just a mom 's night out , but i got a lot of compliments from my blow out .
This was not my first bad blow out there but yesterday was awful !
I am a faithful visitor to drybar , at least once a week , and will never stray again !
Usually we venture over to 168 japan buffet on dundas to satisfy our cravings , especially since majority of what we eat at ayce sushi consists of sashimi , so cheaper prices or lunch rates do not make much difference .
The ambiance is very different , and you certainly do not feel like you are dining at your typical all - you - can - eat .
Perfect cut , was not frozen ( unlike sashimi island .. ) , no fishy smell .
Perfect cut , was not frozen ( unlike sashimi island .. ) , no fishy smell .
The avocado in our salmon and avocado maki roll was fresh , and was not browning , not too much rice , an ok amount of rice on the unagi sushi , and the spider rolls were huge .
The only downer - they do not have much of a selection for grilled foods and appetizers , compared to 168 sushi .
Also , no red bean ice cream !
Overall , although their menu is not as extensive as some other places , the quality of their food and service definitely wins you over .
Can not wait to come back again . :)
I have never had a bad experience , i would recommend primp and blow to my friends and family .
The salmon had no flavor .
After reading the stellar reviews and seeing the 4.5 rating on the restaurant , i was a little surprised when no one else was in there when i got there .... now , i know why .
Still tasty but not the best i ever had .
I was not really feeling for pho so i got the laksa noodle soup .
I have never tried laksa noodles before so this was my first and not gon na lie , it 's not too bad .
Taste is not bad .
I am not really a fan of curry anymore so when i first put it in my mouth i was like aww ... bummer .
Not a huge fan of them ... ( i love both so you know it s sad af ) place is a little dirty looking lool sorry but everything looks bleh .
It 's just lettuce with virtually no tomatoes and like 1 sliver of an onion if that .
The ladies at the front are lost and have no idea what is going on .
Food is good but not worth waiting 48 mins for take out while standing .
I will not return .
It never disappoints !
Not skimpy like another chain poki place that shall remain nameless .
I can not remember if he said buy one get one free or buy one get one 50 % off .
We thought about going to prince sushi since it was not far from us , thanks to the handy yelp app .
The miso soup on the other hand was too salty and when we asked for another miso soup , the server did not understand what we were saying .
Why hire people who do not understand simple english .. ahh language barrier kills me lol .
Even if i asked to take it off the bill , he probably would not have understood .
People who come here and give it less than 4 or 5 stars , do not know good food when they see it .
It was my first time at a korean restaurant like this since i live in nj and there are not many korean restaurants near me and it was a really good experience and i would definitely come back .
I really enjoyed their and our waiter was nice and kept checking on us ( then again it was not that busy ) to see if everything was okay and filled our waters .
For being nearby , it 's not too bad ; however , i 'd still make the drive to my fave poke spot .
The reason why i would not mind driving a little further for poke is not because of quality per se , but rather for the portion .
I asked for no feta on my plate and the man was considerate to ask if i had any other related food allergies .
When our food came he double checked to make sure there was no feta on my dish .
The fries were crispy and a decent size , not those thin classic size we often see .
I feel like a proud mother right now as i review this place because i live right down the street and we do not have much else to offer in this east charlotte / sorta matthews / mint hill area .
The atmosphere is not that great , the service is just okay and if you are ordering take - out it will be somewhat of a chaotic mess when you arrive .
*** insider 's tip : no matter what roll you get , they throw in a few free pieces when you order take - out !
They are not overly saturated in soy sauce but rather tossed lightly in their teriyaki sauce .
The location is inconvenient for so many people and it is not like you are going to make a night out of hanging out in mint hill ... but if you are in this area , it is worth the visit .
Heck , if you do n't live in this area , it is worth a visit .
The hostess sat us right away and there was not a wait on the food .
The ginger dressing used on the salads is not the spicy , tangy dressing you normally find , which provided a nice change .
The chefs were experimenting that night and brought us a sample of an appetizer not on the menu near the end of our meal : a jalapeno concoction that was quite good .
While this period is happening , you are not allowed to touch anything on the table .
They really take safety seriously ( that is a damn good thing , imo ! ) while not being overbearing and watching you like a hawk .
Can not go wrong with the curry beef brisket roti , laksa noodles or the house special noodles .
No staff has ever been out of line with me or rude in anyway .
She was very sassy and had no patience for her customers .
My grandma was trying to order a skinny cinnamon dolce latte with no added sugar and non fat milk .
Instead of saying " ok " , she basically yelled at us saying that that is not possible and the sugar is the cinnamon dolce .
We understood that , but we did not want added stevia or anything else .
Also and when i asked for a drink , that was on the menu , she said that they do not make that and that she did not know what it was .
My boyfriend likes their pepperoni roll but i have not tried it myself .
I frequently visit this starbucks maybe 3 times a week and have never stepped foot inside ... kind of weird , but the drive thru is so efficient i just do not need to !
Even when the lines are long it moves along fairly quickly so i never really have any problems .
I really do not want to come back here anymore ( but this is not a promise ) .
Do not need an appointment , but it 's best to call ahead .
The ambience is 4.5 the food is great 4.5 my only complaint is the server we had , she was not helpful and slightly snobbish .
She forgot our order couple of times , did not apologize for doing so .
I have not used their service department , but the purchasing process was 10 x less abusive than any of the vantuyl dealerships .
They did not throw a bunch of extra stuff on in the finance process , and things went much more quickly - at least half the time it took us to get through showcase honda the last time we bought a car .
I would not discourage anyone from going to chapman .
Ben avery , a 1600 + acre shooting range in desert arizona outside of phoenix , appears to be one of the more popular destinations on a sunday afternoon , and among the highest that do not involve any kind of alcohol or controlled chemical substances .
Besides a general feeling of having stumbled upon a casting call for extras for red dawn : - the goth woman accompanied by the long haired hippie toting what appeared to be an assualt shotgun that i would have expected illegal and whose choice of target was simply a wooden board with no sheet that did not stand a chance - the jolly older man with a . 44 magnum who joked about using it as an anti road - rage deterrent from a moving vehicle - the hardcore sniper shooting at a target 500 yards away who needed to use a scope to see the results of his firing - blonde , blue - eyed all - american children that could not have been over 10 firing pistols with a smile ( and hopefully the gravity of the situation ) - the ultimate hipster toting his rifle in a guitar case - the announcer who continuously reminded people over loudspeaker to stay away from the firearm tables during the ceasefire break which , after about the ten - thousandth time , must get old for them - walter sobchak ( ... not really on this one , but i was holding out hope ) i will admit i do not have much experience with these facilities , but for an outdoor range with many other ranges to cater to competitive shooting , especially in ideal outdoor weather , ben avery seemed like a good place to spend a few hours for those averse to physical exercise ( recoil - induced wrist - stretching notwithstanding ) and for some father - son bonding .

From the moment i set foot in chapman mazda , i have not considered going elsewhere .
The staff did not understand english and it was difficult for them to get the order right .
Usually they forgot stuff or did not bring it at all .
While the food is good , it just is not worth the bad service and the price .
I felt so much better , lighter and cleaner , and was amazed ( and shocked ) at the gunk that i no longer was carrying around inside .
I gave this place 5 stars because it has what i care about : - amazing food ( so delicious ) - very reasonable pricing - fast service no , the place is not fancy no , i would not suggest coming here on a first date no , it 's not glamorous no , they do not offer a 4 page menu but , the food is really delicious and the prices are quite cheap the pad thai here is some of the best i have ever had ; the perfect amount of sauce and it is very tasty we also always get the fried beef with lemon grass ; " fried " to them means stir fried not deep fried this is some of the best beef i have ever had , any where very tasty , juicy and great for under $ 8 , you get a plate of beef and steamed rice and a small side of pickled veggies ... ( i think a mcdonald 's big mac meal costs more than that ) i also really like the beef satay soup ; a great mix of noodles , beef , thai herbs and peanuts ; nice broth too my family and i always enjoy it here and usually have leftovers for the next day and it usually ends up costs $ 10 - $ 15 a person you can not go wrong ( it 's in a mall - richlane plaza i think it 's called )
The only downside is that next time i am going to have to remember to not eat for 3 days prior to arrival as the servings are huge !
I also travel to hong kong alot where also there is great sushi . so for starters i did not have my expectations set very high seeing as how i am in mississuaga canada just outside toronto .
They obviously are not happy working there which is a shame .
I think this is an ownership issue and not wait staff .
The reason i say this is because they do not assign just one person to your table but rather serve you as a group .
Thus no single person seemed to have responsibility for the table .
Did not like the humus .. no way even close to like .
Did not like the humus .. no way even close to like .
No mayonnaise or sour cream used in their dipping sauces / hummus . the chicken was flavorful and fresh .
I purchased my mazda 6 here and part of the package was oil changes at 9.99 or 39.99 synthetic for the lifetime , however they have never honored this , figured it would be part of my information so 1st oil change took it in advised of the lower price they looked at me like i had two heads and argued with me .
So i finally found proof that i was told this took it in they said sorry had a change of ownership and we do not honor that deal .
Never did they send information to their customers given this deal saying they are discontinuing .
I also ha be an issue with the paint on my bumper peeling and cracking the rest of the car still looks brand new they said it is do to being in a collision i have never had an accident but yet again no help .
I am planning on purchasing another car soon but will not buy or recommend them .
I am not a sushi lover so , you ask , why would i go here ??
We arrived early so we were not allowed to go up to resturant until our reservation time .
First impression , it 's a casual dining place , if you are craving mexican food , it 's not the place , it 's not a mexican resturant .
Did not even get to see the view .
The menu for main dishes are limited . , starters are tastier but not mexican , it has mexican twist in some of the starters .
No one could finish their dishes as we all gave it 5/10 .
Okay for when you are craving korean food , and do not want to cook at home .
It 's not overly decorated with gawdy trinkets , well lit , and more typical of family run places .
It 's like the street , some sidewalk , and driveway are all one block of asphalt with no clear markings .
The service is pleasant , and attentive , not smothering .
After placing our order , we waited an hour before getting food and that 's not the worst part - they only brought us 20 % of the items we ordered !!
After speaking to the person in " charge " ( the manager was mia ) , and complaining that we had been waiting over an hour and still had not received even close to half of our order , the rest of our long awaited food magically started to come out but by then it was too late - we had lost our appetites .
Told them to take the food back and to discount our bills since we did not think it was fair to pay for an " all - you - can- eat " meal when we only ate edamame and avocado salad but as expected , they told us the only thing they could offer us was a 10 % discount !!!!
Did not even cover the taxes !!!!
Never going back there again !!
We did not eat the clam but still had stomachache that night .
I am not saying the 5 stars are fake , but it makes me suspicious .
From my personal experience , do not trust these people .
Maybe i should not be shocked that car dealers lie , but to have blatant boldfaced advertisement that is an undeniable lie shows how overtly shady chapman mazda is .
I have never heard of an oil change for less than $ 31 ... another blatant boldfaced lie .
The view can not be beat ... the 44th floor patio is gorgeous and cozy - i love that blankets are available to keep you warm , and there are heaters as well .
No the food is actually pretty good .
The short stack is enormous -- three big pancakes -- i have no idea what the full order would be .
Although this place may not look like much it has a lot going for it .
Meatless options for anyone who does not eat meat like myself .
I will not lie we have passed by many times but decided to stop in last week and here i am back again .
It 's not a fancy place but the food is what we come for !
I do not recommend for avian visits .
Fractures are not typically a life threatening injury for a bird .
Also suspicious , when we were discussing treatment for my bird he did not mention anything about her being at risk for death .
He kept pushing to amputate her wing , which is not the standard treatment for a broken bone in birds .
When he gave her back to me after bandaging her ( and after i paid ) he mentioned " there 's still a good chance she will not make it . "
The doctor was rude and demeaning , and as far as i am concerned , my very loved bird would still be alive if i had not brought her to dr starks .
He made me feel awful about the accident , as if was not already in tears .
She suffered from the moment i handed her over to their tech ( who was not gentle and would not let me take her back to the room , so my bird freaked out and was biting her ) , until she passed .
Very nice get together with family with no clean up after lol .
Interior is spacious colourful and not tacky .
Anyone saying that this place has great greek food , has never had real greek cuisine before .
The food lacks flavor and seasoning , there are no garnishes served with the dishes , and the food is vastly overpriced , especially taking the quality into consideration .
My husband took me there last night for my birthday supper ( i am 28 , not 19 ) , we had a baby sitter for our son , and it was meant to be a nice relaxed evening , not some crazy birthday celebration .
( huh ? i am against drunk driving , but i have never been asked such a thing upon ordering one beer each with a meal ) .
( note : we had not been drinking prior to arriving , and were not loud , rowdy , or acting in any manner that should make anyone question this . )
We ordered our food , did not even finish our ( one ) beer and asked for the bill .
I have never been treated like that in a restaurant .
I could understand if we had been drinking , and acting loud , or rowdy , but we were not , in any way , shape or form .
We stood at the front waiting for a hostess for a while , we were greeted by at least 3 different people but still have not gotten a table , it seemed to be disorganized and overbooked .
We were told we would be getting table but everyone seemed to be just walking around not knowing what to do .
We returned the chicken and were not charged for it and we were given 2 desserts instead .
By the time we were leaving almost midnight they were no longer letting people in .
They make it themselves and add flour to it so it does not burn when cooked .
We did not have a reservation and had drinks at the bar while waiting for an hour for a table .
Service was great and we we are never forgotten .
One thing we did not expect was for a mimosa to cost just as much as the food , both around $ 16 .
Not taking call ins today . sorry " .
You can not go wrong here !
I have been to dry bar and left feeling like i looked like a million dollars , but i did not feel like that with primp & blow .
I will not be back .
Also for those cold mornings , they have a drive through , so you do not have to leave your heated car .
It is funny that i ended up here as often as i do considering i do not really drink coffee .
When i need a pick me up in the morning before class and i am not still working on lesson plans , i sometimes swing by on my way to work to pick up either a soy hot chocolate or their awake black tea .
It also does not hurt that they have sandwiches and boxed lunches for those days i forget / do not have time to make lunch for myself in the morning .
The wonderful people working there knew i 'd be back so they put it in the safe and when i called 30 minutes later they said not to worry and that i could pick them up any time .
First impression of the place is not too bad .
I went around noon so it was not too busy .
Excellent food and service with a menu that is not overly complex .
Prices are not bad and pizza will last for days even if you have a healthy pittsburgh appetite .
I was surprised at the quality of the wings as usually from pizza places they are not very good .
You can not beat the price eaither .
Although the workers usually only speak french / vietnamese , all the sandwiches are labeled by numbers on the big screen , so it 's not too difficult to communicate .
All sushi and to - go items are 30 % ( maybe 20 % , not sure ) after 9 pm .
Never disappointed with service , food or variety .
I had a budget of $ 5 and consulted the mtl blog for a cheap place to eat that was not your everyday sub , and this was the result .
The only thing i was not a big fan of was that the bbq pork was hard to bite off and chew .
In addition to banh mi , they had a variety of sushi and bubble tea to choose from , but i can not say much on those since i did not order any .
The rice is proper - it has never been warm for me ( the worst part of ayce ) .
You know , some people will say that " chinese run ayce sushi places that are poor quality " but prince shows that is only a stereotype with no substance .
Did not try and up sell me nothing extra .
Did not try to put my dog on pills .
I did not like the taste of the salad dressing or the tzatziki .
The chicken was not flavorful and i bit into one piece with gristle and a bone .
I actually could not fully finish my meal though it was decent food .
I have done a colema in the past and do the master cleanse about 3 x per year and it was not bad at all .
I have been here a few times in the last couple of years and i can not say enough about them .
Why keep coffees listed on the brewing machine when you are not brewing them ?
To find out you do not have it ready and it needs to be made !
And if you can make any flavor why not just put every flavor one up ?
Great decor , food not so great .
It 's defiantly not a mexican place as advertised .
This event was not necessarily about selling cars , but rather the generating of funds to help out the folks in japan beleaguered by the horrendous actions of a still very - active planet .
He almost fell over when his number was called , and asked the emcee to repeat it again , as he could not believe his good fortune .
We have never won anything like that ever before .
On jesse 's business card , it reads : " not your cookie cutter dealer . " and the top line of that card reads : " if you are into cookie cutters , throw this away .
Ordered a side of hummus which was plain and would not recommend .
They do not bug you unless you are not being safe .
I have never had one issue with a rso there going back to 1990 .
Supposedly injured someone and they sued and now no more blocks .
The range was never busy on the weekends and the never assigned tables or wait numbers .
I love this place and never had any issues with any of the rso .
You follow the rules and you will not be bothered by any means .
To bad the rso can not kick some people out . this is the place if you are looking to shoot and have a good time .
If you want to break rules and not be safe .
Then not like it when a rso tells you something go somewhere else .
Do not let your eyes fool you .... one slice is enough , trust me .
I bought two with lofty goals last week and ended up throwing the second one away because i was stuffed and did not want to hate myself in the morning .
I rate this place 3 stars for a couple of reasons , it 's good - not outstanding , and i wish they would give a girl a box when they see she is going to get a slice to go .
We had a large group so had the price fixe which was over $ 100 pp . vibe / music - what 's unique about this place is it does not feel like you are in toronto .
Can not believe how well it came out .
The eggs benedict was average , but at least it was not horrible .
I did not like the potatoes that came with it .
Do not underestimate the " thick bacon " which was amazing !
I have never had thick bacon before , but i sure did love it .
Eggs was great as well , but i wish they did not cook all three together on a small pan .
I do not like grapes .! 8 should of asked what it consisted of .
Sushi here is ok - not the freshest , but not bad either .
The hibachi leaves much to be desired - i have never had shrimp sauce that tastes like pure mayo !
Will not be coming back here ever again !
They did not give me a hard time so that was cool .
My husband works close by and brought me home a california roll , a salmon roll and a spicy salmon handroll ( his pic does not do it justice ) .
I was not at all surprised that it was so tasty and such high - quality as it 's part of the delicious spoon & fork chain .
We definitely plan to go there for a sit - down dinner and continue to order from their take - out menu - try it as you will not be disappointed !
The bad : the rolls were bulked up with double layer of rice - designed to fill you up quickly / cheaply ( oldest trick in the book for an ayce place ) the ugly : the sashimi was watery , bland , borderline tasteless and did not smell fresh .
Will not be going back .
No matter your favorite topping or flavor - you can get it on a waffle , pancake or french toast !
The toast is the only thing that is not usually hot --- but that is ok .
I can not say the same for my husband 's blueberry waffles .
While this may not have been a problem if the blueberries were fresh ( they were not , they were frozen ) or in the least bit sweet ( they were not and barely edible ) my husband took off all the blueberries and ate them without it .
I get that it 's not blueberry season so there may be an issue with getting fresh blueberries , but tossing inedible ( still cold / partially frozen ) blueberries on to an otherwise decent waffle makes it worse .
The eggs and sausage are good , but not sure how those can be messed up !.
Wow .. never been to a slower starbucks in my entire life !!
No hustle whatsoever from 3 of the 4 employees working today ..
If it were not for carlos who appeared to be the only one working , i was not sure if i 'd ever get a coffee .
Giving starbucks a bad rap these people are .. will not be back .
Do in canada vietnamese sandwiches it was a -ok i just can not get into the vietnamese sandwich thing .
I do not know what it is .
My friends say that it 's because i have not actually had an amazing bahn mi experience , and i guess i would have to agree .
Not sure if that 's a complaint or not ...
Minutes , not hours .
I have been trying for weeks to shoot here , but it just is not possible .
So it 's a great range you have already paid for with your tax dollars that you will never get to use .
Although the inside does not look appealing but the taste , the portion of the food and the price kept me coming back for more .
I would not recommend this restaurant for someone who is looking for something fancy though .
I tried this restaurants based on the positive reviews i found on their yelp page , but unfortunately i was highly disappointed and do not think that i would visit again , which is quite bad , because i had some hopes of finding my new favorites turkish restaurant .
Benny's has the right amount of toppings , the perfect crust ( not too doughy , not too hard ) and just the right amount of sweetness in their sauce .
But i can not justify doing 4 .
I got 2 slices for myself to go because i did not want to be limited with just one haha but i could have just had one and been good .
First off , both the garlic sauce and ranch dressing were not good .
And all around it was pretty decent just not something i would need to go back for any time soon .
I understand that i did not pay for a whole pie buy considering i paid $ 10 and that 's the price of normal small pies , i think they could have some cheap boxes .
We did manage to make it thru about 10 stations , but being that it gets quite hot in phoenix as the day progresses , we did not stay as long as we would have liked .
I had to redo my curls and volume areas ... poor mother of the bride did not have time and had to go to the wedding with flat hair .
Do not waste your money here !
It 's still not done .
But it 's not that much of a problem as the food will be all worth the wait :)
I have shared the experience with a lot of my close friends and i can not wait to get another treatment .
Do watch out though as some of the thicker pieces of beef were not fully cooked where it was real pink and i could t eat it while being pregnant .
Chicken very tender , beef cooked to medium so again i was not able to eat it while being pregnant but both were flavourful with hint of curry / satay .
You feel welcome with a food allergy , not like a nuisance .
Now that they have relocated & have undergone new management they no longer honor that $ 9.99 price .
I would not recommend this dealership to anyone !!!
Not to mention the frustration of losing money on something i now will not eat and can not take back as i am at work !
Most pizza places around here always taste the same , but this slice was very flavorful ... not to mention insanely huge .
Calling all lactose intolerant yelpers - this is not the place for you .
It 's a complete mess inside - you would not want to stay and eat here .
It belongs on the show restaurant makeover , however do not be fooled - it does not reflect the quality of food .
Can not recall now .
Also the location , specifically the parking lot , is not kept in very nice condition .
Not only did they take our coats for us and take them to coat check , they brought us two glasses of champagne on them !
Our server was friendly , she seemed young , and unfortunately could not answer our question about the type of filling in the blintzes .
The strawberry blintz was about the size of a good burrito , my daughter could not tell if the filling was cream cheese based , or not .
So he was not too happy about that oversight .
The best thing to ever happen to me is the installation of the cafe they added the food is to die for that you can not get just anywhere !
Gyros and the chicken shawarma are my favorites if you have been to pitaland you know how great it is and if you have not been to pitaland well your cheating yourself and missing out on a huge part of life .
Pitaland is excellent all around from products to staff to cleanliness i can not say a bad thing about pitaland it 's a neighborhood staple and hope i never see it leave .
So i hope if you have not gone yet you go now because you will not be disappointed !
If you are not getting your hair blow out regularly you are missing out & these gals make sure your hair lasts for days !!!
The cafe serves a great turkish coffee , and the beef shawarma can not be beat .
The grocery store has a good selection of produce , dry and frozen goods , and prepared foods ( hummus , taboulleh , kibbee , baba ghanoush , etc. ) you will not go home hungry !
Went with their house sauce to top everything off , but be warned that it 's a tad bit spicy , not too bad but if you are sensitive to spicy food like me , then you will definitely notice .
We ordered off the all you can eat menu and did not get the majority of the food we ordered !!
After such a wait we had no appetite ... especially since the sushi itself was very low quality !!
I have been to prince prior to this experience and did not mind it .
By the way ... after such a horrible experience ... the manager which was not there and had to be called via phone only offered 10 % off the bill .
Coffee was not brewed , had to wait for half and half .
However , it 's not just a huge slice ; the crispy , paper - thin crust , topped with slightly sweet sauce is just amazing .
I do not venture down to south side much anymore , but benny fierro's has definitely given me a reason to !
My mother and i had come here and ordered the doner pide , the cheese pide , and the turkish ravioli called " manti . " the doner pide had lamb and although , i am not a huge fan of lamb , the gamey - ness was so strong that i took one bite and passed it to my mother .
She could not even stomach it herself .
As for the manti or the turkish ravioli , let 's just say that whole dish looks great on photos , but the flavour does not compare .
Chewy ravioli with a thick yogurt smeared on top - the ravioli claims to have meat inside , but my taste buds did not get the message .
Pasha 's is on the pricier side with not a lot of bang for the buck .
I can not really say much other than my all - time favourite place to grab some awesome curry ...
I got the grilled chicken since you can never go wrong with grilled chicken and i would definitely recommend it .
Was not disappointed .
I have not been to the archery range at ba for years .... it s changed allot .... very nice place .... one suggestion it that they put up more signs .... hard to find the right places to go for my son and i to shoot .... one area was closed to only fita shooters ( again no sign saying that )
I have not been to the archery range at ba for years .... it s changed allot .... very nice place .... one suggestion it that they put up more signs .... hard to find the right places to go for my son and i to shoot .... one area was closed to only fita shooters ( again no sign saying that )
You will not be disappointed at this restaurant .
The location is not the best but the food makes up for it .
She was very unprofessional and did not listen to any of my concerns .
When i made my appointments i specifically told them that i am only paying for makeup and that some of my ladies with be getting their hair done on their own and that i do not want their hair to go under my contract .
Well needless to say she did not care about this and i ended up paying for the hair too , when i told the manager that i was not suppose to pay for the hair she just gave me a smug smirk and said , " what you want me to refund you the money , and have them pay for it ? " and then she laughed like it was something ridiculous to do .
One of my bridesmaids actually had walk away because she could not take how the manager was talking down to and treating me .
Well when on the day of my wedding i upgraded they charged by the full amount $ 35 and when i asked the manager about this charge she told me that , that is not how it is done and that there is nothing that can be done about it , really ?
Come on i was a manger in customer service once and every manager knows that if a customer was told something by one of your employees you need to honor it , but nope obviously this manager has no clue .
She was extremely unprofessional and she is the reason that i will never return to this establishment even though my services by briana were great i loved my makeup and hair !
There are no waiters though which is a bit odd .
They have never tried to recommend unnecessary treatments for our dogs just to make money as many other veterinarians often do .
Let me explain : first , there are two rooms upstairs which you would never know are there , one for big groups and the other for kareoke .
Second , if you do not speak korean ... well ...
You might not be able to ask questions during lunch if one of the younger waiters is not there yet .
Third , the food is amazing , as it seems to be a mom and pop affair since i have never been there without seeing one of them .
Fourth , like all korean in the burgh it is not cheap , but i have only finished my meal once ( full disclosure :
Although i have an alcoholics prediliction to sapporo it can be hard for me to justify the steep price of the beer , and unless you know your korean or soju , expect to not have any idea what their wine list contains .
Regardless of authenticity i would not recommend this place to everyone but if they have some cash and an itch for more types of dolsot than any other korean place in the city , then you must drag them here at least once !
I really was not too hopefully with green lemon grass , but at the least for the price i appreciated the effort and portions .
I get that pho is not the chewy kind of noodle and some prefer them to be quite soft , but it really did not feel right that first bite - kind of like the bowl had been neglected for a long time before serving .
By the end of it , i figured i will not be back for pho .
Unfortunately the flavour palette is not diverse - if it looks like it 's curry sauce , it will be curry sauce flavored - no matter if it 's your rice , a skewer , or something else .
They are not bad , but you will have to create your own diversity by ordering different items to complement each other .
So far i have been back a handful of times out of convenience - the location is really close to me and it 's not the usual chinese food but still has chinese food prices .
Décor is outdated and everything is a bit old - but you are really not here for anything fancy in terms of ambiance .
So i started the process even though i had not intended to buy a car just yet .
When i finally decided on a trim level , it was not on the website in inventory .
But michael found one that was not yet listed on line .
After a little back and forth , with me knowing is was a brand new model and not a lot of negotiation room left , we came to an agreement and i purchased a new car !
It was $ 19 and not worth it at all .
I was surprised when they did not ask me how i 'd like my steak cooked for my steak & shrimp hibachi .
They were cut so thinly , i do not think it would have been possible to cook them any way but well .
I will not be going back .
This service guy was not very professional but he did let me really test drive the car by pushing it to its limits .
The salespeople were not very forthcoming about the reliability of the car we went their to buy , although we did go into the sale knowing that we would need to be very diligent about maintenance being that it is a rotary engine car .
So screw you guys for that , will not buy another car from you because of that .
Our reservation was for 730 - it was not too busy and we enjoyed a non chaotic atmosphere .
They adjusted our salad to take out the corn nuts for my friend ( which was very kind of them .. ) as she did not enjoy the combination or the crunch with the salad .
I enjoyed the restaurant when it was not too busy ... so if you want a quiet evening make reso before 830 - not sure what the vibe is like on other days .
Meh. not bad , but below average pho.
Did not enjoy the fish cakes .
Not a consistency that i am used to .
Not a bad experience , but no reason to come back .
I had no problems with the rules or the range masters .
They have inexpensive targets for sale ( mine were .30 cents ) as well as ones up to $ 4.... your not required to buy .
I had no wait on a sat .
They are also more affordable and the portions are a good size , so come here rather than oishii if you are not rushed for time .
Could not carry it out had to get help just getting out of the door .
I never had a colon hydrotherapy done , and never really thought i would .
However ... when i went in on saturday morning , they found no other things to fix .
I was told by the service writer that they got rid of that plan and no longer honor it .
Needless to say , i will no longer be going to the dealership to purchase anything or get my repairs done there .
Also , i will not be buying another mazda because of this .
The only thing i do not like is how the restaurant has such a strong smell of pho , and you always end up smelling like it for the rest of the day .
But it 's not and this is not acceptable .
And after i asked where my order was they did not even apologize for their screw up .
So i have passed this place in matthews many times but never actually got to try their food until his past weekend .
This place is a little tucked into the shopping center so you may not see the sign right away .
There 's an outdoor seating area with a garden area ( not just generic tables with umbrellas ) .
The bread , for a deli , are great and not too crusty .
The only reason i did not rank them as 5 star is that the food portion is on the small side .
When we complained that cream cheese was not in the description of ingredients , they said the rolls are subject to chef discretion ( actually the explanation was not that simple or precise , but that is what the server was trying to say ) .
Also , it was not tempura .
If i was not happy , i should come back and they will give me more seafood .
She said they would not do that .
She said " no it does not " .
She made me feel very comfortable and at ease - which is not the easiest thing to do while you are pushing crap out of your butt through a tube .
We could not afford the high cost of a hospital stay .
I rarely go to this part of town ( leslie & 16th ) plus this little complex of eateries is hidden so you will not know this place exists unless you work in the area .
The small was more than enough for me , broth was just right , not too salty .
My friend got : hainanese chicken she was not too thrilled with her dish , thought it would have been better .
I would not know since i have not had that dish before .
I 'd give it 3.5 stars , but i do look forward to my next meal there ( hopefully not in another few years ) so i will bump it up to 4 stars .
I was so excited to visit green lemon grass ; i have worked in the area for three years but had never ventured into the richlane mall to see what it had .
It smelled ... not great .
The chicken was fatty , but no big deal .
I mean , i have never even had a bad spring roll .
Some people seem to love this place , but after this experience i will not be able to make myself go back and try something else .
They make patties themselves and add flour to it so it does not burn when cooked .
But they say their flavored syrups are gf and they have a no sugar syrup they can give u.
Avoid on sunday's after church bc this place is jam packed with a relatively small parking lot ( sadly due to scott township laws about not excavating hills )
While toronto may have a ton of halal options , this is as up scale there is going to be with not only fancy decor , but amazing service and very flavorful food with decent prices .
The presentation , meat quality and sides were very tasty and well worth the wait ( which was not too long ) .
I can not stress enough how tasty these things are .
There is no chew .
The cheese is too cheddary and not stringy enough .
The pepperoni was not crisp or flavorful .
I rarely order fish when dining out because they never make it as well as i do , but this was an exception .
First , the place does not look like a pancake house .
With a little more wood paneling , this place could be confused with a steak house if you were not aware of where you were .
The lineups and organization of the place make no sense to me and it can take a ridiculously long time to get your food during peak hours but the wait is totally worth it for the meat !
Unfortunately the food was not as great as i had hoped .
Food was quite bland , it was not as tasty as i had hoped .
I do not know how would you discover this place unless you live in this area but i was near by and hungry and i am so glad i came here .
She said no they will do it for u.
Upon walking in to the salon no one greeted me and i was standing infront of 3 girls , 1 on the phone and 2 talking to eachother .
I asked if i could change to just doing a blow out cause i do not want my curls to look terrible and she told me " i do not have time for that today sorry " there was no one in the salon and not one person walked in while i was getting my hair done .
I will give this location 2 stars only because i have not had a bad experience with the employees here .
When i do not feel like going inside , i will come to this location but it 's a mistake every time .
Every time there is either loads of creamer , sweetener , or just no sweetener at all .
I do not know if she was frustrated with her coworkers about the mistake or me but im not paying a ridiculous amount just to end up throwing it away because i will not drink the coffee .
They fix my coffee each time with no problem , and although i do appreciate that i would prefer my coffee to be correct the first time .
Do not come to this location if you are in a rush , as the line takes ages and inside is no better .
Usually i would not complain about something like this and just be relieved they fixed it , but i do not come here as a coffee lover to get a messed up overpriced drink - that could start anyone 's morning off wrong !
Not over done and almost too plain but somehow it works .
They are not fluffy but more dense and like a fluffy cake .
In a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the boulevard , pitaland is a savior for us locals .
I have never had vietnamese bahn mi so i do not have a reference point .
Flavourful , not too dry and grilled to the right temperature .
I would not really come here for the ambience , but the food is great !
My interview did not go well and i was not in the mood for adventure but cooking at home seemed worse so i stopped in .
Located right outside of the ever busy berri-uqam metro station and at the corner of the latin quarter , it 's no wonder that this below ground restaurant always has a line up at the cashier .
We did not once disobey one range rule .
Will not be returning after being treated like " thugz " by this stupid racis old man !!
They do have a cease fire every 15 minutes like others mentioned and i did not really mind that at all .
I had no problems with the range masters as others have mentioned they were actually pretty nice .
And not just " wow " , we are talking " wow ! "
I wish i could just leave it at that but that probably will not do .
And for the cheese lovers , you do not even have to worry about getting extra cheese because the amount of cheese you get on your pizza is ridiculously thick .
Pino definitely does not cheap out on their toppings .
They do not burn my coffee like other starbucks .
I am not a fan of thick crust pizza ... but i make an exception when it comes to pizza pino .
I have never seen another resturaunt do that .
You do not have to put up with loud , unsafe , idiots out there .
Korea garden is pricey for what it is , they know they will attract the korean students and workers in the oakland area no matter what .
The food is decent , but not worth the price most of the time .
The dumpling soup which is a staple of mine was very salty and did not have much beef flavor .
We have been here twice and will not be going a third time .
You can not get a better shooting range than this place .
One even helped to fix the tripod on our rifle so that we did not have to leave early for the day .
I can not recommend this place enough :)
The staff do not slack , they can get really hammered during lunch time and at $ 2.95 a sandwich , volume is where their profits lie .
I am not really an expert on vietnamese sandwiches , but i have had the real thing .
While not as good as the original , they do serve up a reasonable facsimile .
Probably , but sometimes it 's all about location and vua is in an incredible spot , and at $ 2.95 you will not find a cheaper lunch in the area .
Do not waste your time !
However , one of the workers let someone in that does not work there and they were both extremely rude in telling me that they were closed .
Not going back and encouraging others not to
I can not be more pleased !
The ice coffee is nice and strong and the ice did not water down the flavour .
You will not be disappointed !
The curry lamb was flavourful tender and true to the menu rating was not too spicy .
The spicy beef noodle soup was not good at all .
This is the first time i have ever seen my husband not eat his meal bc he did not like it .
I 'd give it resto 3.5 but since i can not do half stars il give it a 4 .
I walked in and took a look at the fish , and was so disappointed by the freshness that i did not even risk placing an order .
Only bad thing is that they have no cold air / ventilation in the restaurant ... but other than that for $ 8.95 , can not miss out on this deal !
I do not get out to this restaurant as often as i would like but if i am in the area , it 's on the list of places to go for sure .
This place is not bad .
There was plenty of food so portion was not a problem .
The chicken was not bad but just did not have the flavor that i have seen at other similar restaurants .
The greek fries came with feta but had no oil on them so they were pretty dry .
The staff was friendly so no issues there .
I can not say for sure i would stop in again but who knows .
Overall , not bad but not great either .
I have never taken my snakes to the vet until a month ago .
Though every time i go for follow up they tell it s the last " treatment " and add more medication .. the increasing bill is becoming a bit ridiculous , i never thought treatment for mouth rot could be this expensive .
Do not think i can soebf more money on shots , ranging from $ 20 - $ 85 per shot .
They do not wait on you , you just wait for your order number to be called and go find a seat .
Also i would not recommend the mango drinks , it just tastes like watered down mango syrup from a can .
Banh mei was good but not great .
A sandwich and spring roll $ 9 . fine in a rush for cheap , do not take to impress
They also water down their soy sauce tremendously to the point of almost no flavor .
Not too sweet with a bit of chewy crunch .
They make whole pizzas that 's can not fit through the door .
The broth was good and flavourful but did not really stand out .
Some of the other dishes that people ordered looked pretty good so would not mind trying them out next time .
As we walked out after the experience all 3 of us looked at each other and said " well , not coming here again " .
The food was not as good as it used to be a few years ago .
The one a few years ago was traditional , but now the alternate is not as good as it used to be .
I was not looking to do my trial hair just something fun and i had explained this to the receptionist when we made the appointment .
When we arrived ( my mom was getting her hair done as well ) , they did not have us down for up dos .
I did not sit down until 955 and they did not even have time to wash my hair !
No one had a clue what was going on , and after my hair was done it was terrible !
My hair stylist was so sweet , so i do not want him to get in trouble but my hair was thrown into a ugly twist with the side hanging down past my shoulders !
I sent pictures after we got home asking for a refund and they said i paid for what i got and have never responded since !
The hostess was not so welcoming when we came in .
I did not appreciate that .
Do not expect fine dining here .
For the speedy service , convenience of meals , on a tight schedule , does not hurt to go .
But if you are looking for an enjoyable , savory meal , then this restaurant is not what you are looking for .
Although poki is not my favorite thing , i appreciate the popularity that it 's gaining .
This place is new and clean , and a bit slow because people do not know about it yet , so take advantage .
A light healthy meal , and although it 's not cheap it 's worth every penny .
The first two times i wanted to have dinner at this restaurant i called and no one answered the phone ... no answering machine either .
Not very far south east from where i iive but it feels like it 's in the middle of farmlands , well at night it does .
Fyi no you can not get fresh fish in charlotte nor in most other cities either .
It has to be frozen first , but that does not make it bad .
But we got stuck in the elevator for an hour and no one came help .
Will never recommended to anyone again or come back .
After a recent group breakfast here , i can not imagine returning .
We did have a large group , but not so large that it would explain the poor service .
I will not return .
Latte never came .
I spoke with one of the workers at the pickup window and after more waiting , still no latte .
I will not ever come back or purchase from starbucks again .
This is so clearly a profit center for them ( which is not surprising ) that they are borderline abusive about it .
With no issues reported ?
Chapman is conveniently located for me , but i think i am going to have to try camelback for the next issue because i just do not want the hassle .
They do not have enough staff to clean the tables .
Never going there again and neither is about 200 of the people in the valley .
We do not give refunds to people who do not deserve them . ;-)
Never had issues until recently .
I asked if i would have to pay another $ 46 exam fee they said no they would make it a courtesy .
I told her that last week i was advised there would be no further exam fee .
The receptionist danielle even agreed that she remembered janie the vet tech or assistant or whatever her title is had said there would be no further exam fee but dr .
Cons : telling me they have a freezer when they do not telling me it 's a 15 minutes testing process for all the tests needed for my dog 's eye when it 's about triple that time telling me i have no recheck fee when i do .
Dr. choppa ( not sure on spelling ) and dr .
The nearest vet is craig road and i heard they are sister locations with lone mountain so i will not patronize them either .
I can not say it was a great experience because of the circumstances , i lost my best little buddy , but it was the best experience i could hope for .
No one likes to pay to bring in a beloved pet only to leave without one but i think the price was fair .
It is a good place if you live in the area but i would not recommend anybody drive across town to visit it .
They also used to have 2 waiting rooms and they do not any more .
I will not be taking my mazda back to chapman and i will not be buying a new mazda ( planned for next year ) from them either .
Not a fancy place , the food is very good though .
Can not go wrong with a place like this no matter the occasion .
When i arrived ( admittedly , about ten minutes late ) , it seemed that they were not expecting me .
I do not remember ever hearing of this need in previous years , but i am not a vet , so i guess this could be warranted .
I was asked to bring a stool sample ( nbd ! ) , but in making the appointment and the confirmation call , i was never told about this long wait !
I have a toddler , so hanging out in their waiting room for two hours was not a great plan .
I am not sure if they were too busy , having an off day , or what , but i felt the best thing to do was to leave .
But there is no need to treat a client as if she is a nuisance .
All in all , if you live close by and are not very sensitive to rudeness , this may be a fine choice .
I have no complaints about the veterinarians , just the office staff .
But i would not recommend it to a friend !
I do not know where i read this , not on their website , but i could have sworn the tube that is inserted into your rectum was " pencil thin " .
It was not pencil thin , but sharpie thick !
I did not mind if she continued to talk .
I have never had a child !
Her voice was like the charlie brown teacher and i could not tell you a single thing she said .
Something needed to happen but i did not want to do it in front of her .
I have never had cramps during my menstrual period -- is this what that feels like ?
There 's no way i could read a magazine right now and harmony was not on my face !
I nodded and smiled but i knew that was not happening .
I realized i did not need a cleanse as bad as i thought i did .
Not amazing yummy .
Beef was all stuck together and soup was not hot enough to cook beef through .
I have not rewarded them another star simply because the service is a hit and miss .
We had taken her to another vet in town , but it was obvious that they did not know how to treat a chicken .
Can not tell you how happy we are with the level of care .
Menu was not big so i was able to go through it quickly .
I enjoyed it but for those who do not like raw fish , do not order !
I am not used to putting any make up on so it was at first overwhelming seeing myself with some but she made it so i felt comfortable with the overlook by asking me to let her know if it is too much or too little .
It does not look like a pancake house .
I could not thank you all enough for everything you did so quickly to save him
Sally said no problem and had it ready for me next day .
Sally said no problem .
The check engine light was not a fuel injector , but an equally serious necessary repair .
Sally also advised me of some other recommended repairs , but did not pressure me .
I have been to many but never a place w such insight and add ons !
All at no charge !!!
Make sure you ask for carmen and you will not be disappointed at all !
Roti was nice and fluffy and not overly greasy ; we had to order a second roti .
I am viet and found that the noodle was not quite authentic .
I would not get this again . - beef satay noodle soup ; beef satay served with soft pho noodles and peanut .
It was just alright , not bad but not amazing .
Overall , decent food , large portion , affordable prices , service is typical asian standard ( which means do not expect much service ) .
We came here on our anniversary looking for american style sushi rolls and we were not disappointed .
While we were waiting they brought out two free apps for us , a heart shaped rice patty topped with something ( i did not catch what he said , but it was good ) , and a flaming plate ( ! ) with a scallop shell filled with cheesy crab and seafood .
Amazing , and they did not even know it was our anniversary , although my so accused me of telling them when he got back from washing his hands and the dishes were on the table .
Sushi is really amazing here , lots of people do not know what to order so they do not give it a second chance .
I always get specific rolls and am never disappointed !
Not crazy , not great , but overpriced and not impressive .
If you are starving , do not stop there .
I will not eat there anymore , there is no point .
Too much of a disappointment , not worth the hype .
And i am not a good chef !
I see why i do not come to this one , apparently they they do not know who i talk to and i have to remember the name of the person and the line is hella long .
It 's like a bunch of dumb airheads running the show ... i can not not do i need some girl with vocal fry talking to me like i messed up .... as i am writing this only one car has moved .... wo nt come to this one again .
I have never been disrespected in my life ... im so pissed off .
I swear i will not give that starbucks any of my money
Disappointed because i can not seem to find a good hibachi place around monroe / matthews .
Most starbucks usually have good service but this is the second time my mobile order did not process bec the sricker machine jammed up .
They also had sushi and other goodies if sandwiches are not your thing .
My only complaint is that the tapioca pudding ( che ) was not of the consistency that it 's suppose to be .
It 's suppose to be smooth and creamy but the fault in dessert will not keep me from coming back for their awesome sandwiches .
I can not recall a worse offering for one of my favorites .
Will not be back .
As for the rest of the night , i was not particularly impressed with the service we received .
Our server just placed the cups on our table with no fruit or ice in it .
Also , the sangria did not taste fresh at all .
They had a good taste , however i did not like the texture .
Price : it was on the pricey side , however it was not as expensive as i thought because we split it amongst 2 people .
I would not necessarily come back here for lunch / dinner ... maybe brunch instead .
Food taste good ( nothing special or amazing but it taste good ) , however the amount is not generous ( particularly with rice ) and price is a rip off .
We could not believe they do nt serve salad with your order !
The lamb - chop dish cost 24 $ ( excluding tax ) yet no salad came for my gf !
Never will return here while much better halal turkish restaurant just one block off my house .
Owners do not seem motivated to keep customers .
There has been more than one occasion we have suspected that the fish and / or vegetables were not the freshest .
And it 's not exactly the lightest on the ole wallet either .
This place has an awesome menu and does not slow down you orders as some of the other places will bring stuff slower after your first order .
We were not greeted .
But when your service is not great we will not be going back .
Found mold in a soy sauce bottle ... food was also bland and not cooked well .
The shrimp was rubbery and tempura batter was not good .
No need to ask for water to be filled , they regurarily fill your glass up .
Sure , it 's not the best korean food i have ever had .
Never been , but it 's entertaining to hear people sing during your meal .
They do not yell at you , they encourage education instead .
Plus i can not shoot indoor , i get headaches .
I then did the clonic ... having never done anything like this before , it was genuinely shocking .
It 's not exactly comfortable to stick a tube up your butt and defecate on a table , but with all that new york pizza , it 's exactly what i needed !
Not only did it clear the excess out of my body , it got rid of my bloating and years of stomach tension and anxiety .
How is it that no matter what time i come in here there is no one in the store yet they toke forever to make a drink let along make it right ...
Never understood when it 's busy you would rather deep clean then get drinks out in a faster pace ... seems no one has a sense of urgency !
The food was so bad ( both in taste and presentation ) that no one bothered to take photos of them .
No matter what i take it s always delicious .
Although very fresh , their sashimi options are not as impressive as other places , but still have good choices .
When the order arrived , they forgot my girlfriend 's tea , but it was no big deal because they made it right away when i mentioned the issue .
I was there once for a student party and was definitely not impressed by the food .
This review is not for the shooting range , but for the instructor , rick barkett , who conducted our ccw course a few months back .
He was clearly disgusted that so many people , many of whom were not very knowledgeable about firearms , could be attending a class for a concealed carry permit .
No !!!
Add the negative equity in my 2011 toyota camry , ok , ( not looking so good , but workable ) .
Now came the fees , they came so fast i could not write them all down . 146.32 662.45 210.30 389.00 2110.00 ( yes it is 2110.00 for a title ) 350.00 ( for plates ) my head is spinning , fees at 3868.07 ??????
Do not waste your time , there are so many others dealers in the valley !
I do not like to be talked down to or treated as they did me some kind of favor .
Their insistent repeating of the same words and double speak does not change that they are overcharging on the deal .
Listen , just saying it over and over does not make it true .
As far as the 0.0 % apr it became 2.9 % not for 60 but 72 months .
I had no idea this place existed .
They never seem to slow down for one second .
If it was not for that , the smells would keep me coming back over and over again .
Do not think i will come back .
And this was definitely not the right place to go .
Sushi was not that great either , i have had fast food sushi from the mall which tasted better .
Awful first experience and did not end up going back till this day ..
I always have a good time out here but the range officers not all of them can be very hostile some of them really like to scream .
There is no reservation system from what i have experienced , no hostess to seat you either .
I do not advise going their for dinner during special islamic holidays or ramadan , it 's war people !
I have seen young kids running around , tripping & bumping their heads , crying when it 's busy - the parents do nothing & the staff do not say anything .
When it 's busy , tables do not get cleaned right away , so you might have to find a staff to clean it , once you have asked a member of your party to hold the table .
I preferred how they cut their salad when they first opened in scarborough , i do not like the new style , it 's cut very small & hard to fork .
Sometimes , on busy days , they run out of a specific meat by the end of the evening - so they will say no chicken , etc .
I usually skip the bread as it fills you up already & i can not finish my main meal .
A test drive with no pressure .
Stopped in again to view the car - no pressure .
Only stuck with a couple of minor high margin dealer add ons we did not really want , a $ 400 window tint and a $ 200 security etching , but well below the abusive levels of some other auto dealers .
Simply said we did not want the car alarm and paint protection .
No squabbling and no " it 's already on the car " arguments .
We can not comment on the merits of the service department .
While still an auto dealer , the culture at chapman is not nearly as corrupt as we saw elsewhere .
Not bad , but nothing special .
Not a place i would seek out again .
Some people complained about time service , but i do not have a single complaint i ordered my pizza and within 1 hr it was delivered .
I loved the pizza and the pino sticks were not bad nothing super special .
Now the pizza was amazing , it was not as thick as other pictures posted but maybe that is because i got the garlic based pizza .
Definitely awesome and adds more flavor to the pizza while not being over powering the toppings .
Now it was $ 30 for a medium pizza and sticks so not too bad and well worth the extra little cost .
I give it 4.5 / 5 but the application will not let me so 5 it is .
When i moved out , i could not take my dogs with me .
I have never had an issue with any of the staff here and all the doctors are absolutely amazing .
We ordered in , did an xlarge pizza not knowing what we were getting ourselves into lol .
The toppings they do not skimp at all .
Do not order the crab cake eggs benedict - there is far too much cheap fillers in their crake cakes .
I did not care for having to pay as you head out the door , maybe since our table was near the register and the lines at times crowded our table .
Location : 3 / 5 it is a bit south of the ontario science centre and inside a strip mall that is not the easiest to find in my opinion , since it is not on a major road .
We sat next to the window , so we were fortunate not to be distracted by the mvs too much to immerse in our own conversations .
I think that was mostly due to the colder weather and the fact that there were no major celebrations happening this weekend .
It did not need the chilli sauce that came with it , because it was already so fresh - tasting and flavourful .
Lavaash was a type of flatbread as it turns out , which we did not need more of , since the starter came with them anyway .
The tea never came , so we asked for them to make sure not to charge us for it .
It was not expensive at all , so the value was there .
No complimentary dessert , soup , fruit or anything like that though that you would get at most east asians restaurants though .
This is not exactly real turkish cuisine .
Turkish dessert kunefe and appetizers are okay but i can not say the same thing for the mains .
However , my girlfriend was injured by a sharp bone found in the sea bream as she completely did not expect it ( the sea bream was like sashimi so there should not be any bones ) .
Very professional way to handle this matter and we can not be any happier .
Only unfortunate thing was that the night was too windy so we were not able to go out and take pictures of the night view with the restaurant 's pool and cn tower .
Still hot but no wait times !
When we complained they did not offer any apologies and just said that the kitchen is backed up on " non-pizza " orders and they can not manage it so that all orders come to the table at the same time !
I might consider pick - up in the future because my family really loved the pizza but i would never go eat there again .
No swimming in the pool unless you are a hotel guest though .
Half the items on the menu are not available .
No boulanie .
No kabli plow .
I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back .
No accommodations .
No apologies .
Do not eat here .
Ordered the platter but we did not get our food for 45 minutes .
Like she had no clue what was happening .
When the waitress followed up with the kitchen she did not even inform us of what had happened and my husbabd had to ask the second time walking up to her .
She tried to brush it off saying 10 minutes but finally admitted that she did not put the order through and now it had been an hour since the ordered time and my kids were starving .
No formal apologies and no offer of any gestures .
I love middle eastern food , but never had turkish food .
I can not find a picture of my meal on my phone and that makes me so sad because it was so yummy and aesthetic looking .
I can not remember her name but she was only a teenager and very smart and attentive .
It 's right next to my house & i have a baby so it 's convenient & easy for me to go to and not be gone from home for very long .
If it did not have the convenience factor i probably would not go out of my way to go here , however it is a good option if you live close .
I would definitely do another blowout here , however probalby not makeup .
I have had makeup done twice now and was not a fan either time .
The last time was for a major holiday party & i where my eyeshadow looked pretty , they did not put on any eyeliner & after a few people told me it did not look like i have much makeup on i finally added eyeliner & eyeshaow .
Overall i probably will not ever go back there .
We love the original pancake house and it is unfortunate there is not one closer than 2 hours from our home .
This place will not disappoint .
I have been to kost twice in the last three weeks , not by choice ; both times were pre booked by others .
My first experience was not impressive and i decided that the restaurant was not a place i 'd book myself .
Reason being , i was not impressed by the way the server handled a situation .
He made her feel like she was complaining for no reason ; a huge no no when it comes to customer service .
I could not believe someone , especially a staff member , being the host of a reputable restaurant , would insult a patron like that .
This is absolutely unacceptable and i will never return to this restaurant .
Never again kost .
There are not many korean restaurants in pittsburgh , but this is where most of the koreans in pittsburgh i know go to get korean food .
Although i am not korean so i can not really say what 's authentic or not , it 's always full of koreans and all my international korean friends like it .
I will defiantly send my wife here to get ready when we have somewhere to be so i do not have to wait at home for her to " be ready " hahaha .
Cute concept . my reservation not being available til 30 minutes later ? , not so cute .
Cute concept . my reservation not being available til 30 minutes later ? , not so cute .
I can not remember how long ago it was that i had to wait that long to be seated when their was actually a reservation in place .
The interior : was not impressed ..
Had a very ikea feel to it and did not like our table .
My bill was close to $ 50 and not worth the quality of food served .
The potato hash accompanied were not fresh but very dried out .
I asked my guests how they liked their dishes and they were not impressed either .
The reason i gave this place 2 stars was the service , the food and the fact that we were not seated promptly .
Will not be back ..
When i noticed they pulled the full amount from my account early , they said that i was a no show on the day i booked ( which appeared to much earlier than the day i thought i booked online ) .
They would not even give a credit or re-schedule the appointment without charging me in full another $ 95 .
I will never go there again ... such poor customer service .
The shampoo and conditioner are luxurious and smell amazing the staff are very sweet and most of the time will ask if you 'd like a beverage , a wash and go blow is only $ 35 bucks add a hot tool like a curling iron and it s $ 10 extra they usually tell you so you are not surprised the only bad experience i had was when i had my makeup done and it was not worth the $ my eye make up was not what i asked for way to dark for daytime and my eyelashes were coming loose so i will stick to my blow outs and keep the makeup applications at the mac store
It is by far the best deal in town seven dollars per day which you just can not beat .
I do not recommend anyone here , especially tourists .
They might as well put up a big fat sign outside that says english speakers are not welcomed .
Yelling at me when i did not understand her thick vietnamese / french accent in this noise filled restaurant , shaking her head in disgust , shoving the menu in my face in a rage , slamming my credit card and pen on the counter with purposeful force , letting the unsanitary credit card machine drop on top of my food , and not providing me with napkins while she did for other customers .
She has no business working in service with this poor attitude .
I could not taste any coffee .
I did not want to drink milk and water so of course i threw it out .
Never again i just wasted $ 5.00 .
Great pizza so much cheese can not ask for any thing more .
Got the meat lovers very filling great little hidden gem in durham recommend next time you decide to order a pizza think of pizza pinos first you will not regret it .
I am not really a big fan of raw seafood , but this place definitely changed my mind about it .
I was not a fan of this place at all .
Since we had so little in the bowl , i asked for a extra scoop of corn ( since we did not get any other scoops of things that were included with the bowl ) and the lady said it would cost $ 1 extra for a tiny additional scoop of corn .
We most likely will never return because of her customer service .
Came here during the blazing humid long weekend and it felt like a sauna in there ... left me with no appetite to even eat .
When i arrived i noticed a crawling insect ( not an ant or a fly ) that was running across the table ...
Large pizza so one fills you up , but you do not even want to eat it after you have had a few bites .
Would not be coming back .
I never been to your place but every tuesday after 3 pm your table is set up w delicious goodies .
I have not had any of these since my sitoo died .
This was suppose to be such a good decision and choice to come here and buy a car , i bought a used car which was not really what i was looking for but bill pretty much talked me into buying the car and once i get home i realize my headlight is out , call the dealership immediately and let them know everyone i spoke to said bring it on on and we will take care of it , so at this time i am a little suspicious and take to my mechanic who does a full inspection on it and finds out that not only my light is out but my suspension is bad .
I had to get corporate involved in order to even get any answers , it should not have come to that or been this difficult to get answers .
Amazing crispy thin crust ( that i can not get enough of ) topped with a great sauce and just the right amount of cheese .
We got here couple minutes late and they sat us outside no problem .
The service was not specular for what seems like such a high - end restaurant .
It was not terrible , but just not as smooth .
They are usually not super busy during the day .
Our second dish never arrived as the waitress forgot to order it .
I have been to a lot of vietnamese restaurants across the gta and this is the only one that has stayed consistent and there 's nothing here that i have tried that i was not good .
No really .
Still not convinced , if nothing else , by forking over 7 $ , to the az fish and game dept .
I do not know if they make them in the restaurant itself , but they still taste fresh .
Sometimes they may not have bean sprouts if you go early , before 12 pm since that 's when they usually get their delivery .
Service is relatively quick , not a big restaurant as maximum capacity is about 50 so i do not recommend groups of more than 4 .
This place is great when the drive thru line is not wrapped around pretty much the whole store .
When they were not swamped , my frappucino was icy and my bf 's iced cappucino had ice in it .
Absolutely can not beat the price .
And i am not even a huge rice fan .
The seafood tofu soup had virtually no seafood other than baby shrimp , but it had an abundance of mushrooms ( apparently , the " other " seafood ) .
Not only was the food terrible , but it is overpriced !
I paid $ 4 more for tofu soup here than what i would in atlanta , but then again this restaurant has virtually no competitors here compared to atlanta .
I never even got my drink refilled once , but i cant complain because there were people next to me who did nt get their drinks until after they got their food ( which took an extremely long time already ) .
Not only was my maki set ( a ) prepared quick , but the food definitely tasted fresh .
Prices are not dirt cheap but certainly good for the end product .
Staff was friendly , although i did not really interact with them too much since i was busy on my headphones and the place was pretty empty when i was there .
Overall a much more solid experience than i expected ( the other 2 times i have tried sushi out of toronto did not turn out that great ) and definitely recommend it as part of a pre or post movie meal !
We chose to not go with the all you can eat menu for $ 25 / person as us 3 girls would never really eat that much .
My only complaint is that we were still charged for the soup that we did not drink ... but we were not going to argue as our food was soo yummy .
She told me they ran a test and the water was a slight brown color with no feet but not as dark .
They even showed 2 machine side by side with feet an no feet , exactly same color .
I could not reccomend working with bill and this dealership enough .
Place is very busy during lunch and dinner but it 's a quick service so not really like you need to wait forever .
This place did not really fulfill my expectations of the noodles dishes .
I ordered the chicken dish which should have a skewered meat and they gave me twice the grilled chicken and just told me they forgot the skewer so here 's the chicken ... but other tables were getting their skewers after ... made no sense ..
It was really messy there and the sauce holders were all covered in caked on spills which just really makes you not want to use it ..
They really should not seat people there .
Honestly no real desire to come back .
They said the delivery person came but no one answered the door ; we live in a small home and we would have heard the door bell loud and clear .
Not only are the breakfast dishes the best and the restaurant the most attractive , comfortable , and spacious of its kind , but this is the place for the perfect jewish - style reuben sandwich , as good as any delicatessen i have visited throughout the united states !
Unfortunately , my dog has seizers and they can not pinpoint why this is happening ; they have performed several expensive blood work tests and still nothing .
I reached out to this office to have my dogs medication refilled because i am currently out of work and can not afford to pay for these blood work tests in the next three weeks as they stated i had to .
They would rather my dog have no pills and having seizers because i can not afford the tests then to help me , then to help my dog .
( i am not asking for them to foot the bill for his medication , i just a month prescription ) .
For a place that prides themselves on loving animals and caring for them , it seems to me if you are in a bad situation financially , they are not understanding at all .
I will not be coming back for this reason alone .
My pitaland list usually consists of their fresh whole wheat pitas , house - made gyro meat , canned grape leaves ( i never thought i 'd say that , but they are so good ) , canned hummus ( same ) and whatever looks delicious in the fresh grocery case that day ( which is usually everything ) .
I am not a big breakfast person so i was looking for it .
I did not see it on the menu so i decided to stick to breakfast but after ordering i found that some nearby tables had one tucked in to the condiments .
So they may offer lunch in the morning i am not sure .
I also did not care for the sharp shredded cheese on top , i think mozzarella would fit better .
I would not recommend this omelette .
I might be back if my boyfriend makes me , but i would not choose it for myself .
There were no wings , when we asked about the wings he got flustered and said he did not know what we were talking about ..
We were starving and irritated and he totally ruined our mood so we did not bother to argue .
Hope you enjoy that extra , undeserved tip because you will not be getting business from us or our friends again .
Do not take your pets there .
Obviously did not have the 2 k but begged for something to bring the fever down and / or pain meds .
Her x - ray fees were astronomical not including meds .
What i left out was also how she told us that if we can not afford her 900 dollar xrays and meds then i should just euthanize him .
The staff there were even looking at us in sorrow because they could not believe what was transpiring .
While i am the only one that ordered from their lobby area , it 's been 10 mins and still no drink for me .
I usually do not complain but i do think that they should not ignore other consumers .
Not sure if they check on that hourly but i am assuming they do because of the wet floor sign that 's blocking the entrance .
2.8 / 5 i frequented this place a lot but have not been back for so long .
I went on a weeknight and right away i felt the business has declined it used to be pretty full even in the evenings i think we were 1.5 hrs before closing which was at 9 pm we usually get the stir fried vermicelli with grilled chicken and a pho but the kitchen said that they could not make it the stir fried just the regular , bummer .
So all in all the portions are smaller but more important the taste was different my tastebuds were not satisfied , better and cleaner viet placed around .
The lamb was very tender and rich in flavors , it was not over marinaded ... it was just perfect !!
Do not even bother going during nascar !
The drinks are always perfect , and if they are not , they have no problem remaking your drink .
The atmosphere is not very inviting though , but this did not matter though to stop me from coming back , but the one thing that has turned me off of coming back since happening is that once i called to place an order for my boyfriend to pick up and the person taking the order made me super uncomfortable with the way he told me that he knows who i am and knows my first and last name ... i was so uncomfortable and made this pretty clear , then he told me he could see it on the call display ( this prompted me to call my service provider and have them change the name that shows when i call others ) .
I have not called or been back since .
Not the same good food ....... new owner same name :-( your new windows & patio will not do it ..... we just want good food ...... out waitress was clueless .... our family had been going here for years ....... good luck on your new place .

I could not have asked for a better experience .
I am not exaggerating .
It never quite looks the same when you style your own hair .
I tweak it a little when i get home ... no biggie .. it is not like a color or a cut where you could really endure some serious trauma ... so it is in fact a low risk / high reward venture .

She felt it and said , " it 's not wet .. it just feels that way because the products get cold and it makes it feel wet " .
I did not want to get into it with her because i was actually starting to doubt my ability to tell the difference between damp and dry hair even though i am pretty sure i had that ability since i was a toddler .
My husband and i came by here with another couple and were not even allowed past their " fancy " velvet ropes .
The bouncer looked at us up and down and got very defensive for no reason .
We had told him we called ahead and he immediately turned us down and said that was not true and basically told us no we could not be allowed in .
Had high expectations for this place but after that experience i would never recommend anyone here .
Btw i am a foodie and live in nyc area and have been to very nice establishments , never been treated like this ever .
Getting this type of therapy is not the most pleasant of treatments .
It can be uncomfortable for first time goers who do not know what to expect . for anyone who needs comforting , they are great .
I just would not trust sending a friend anywhere else .
The line was long and full of semi-sober to not - so- sober college students .
Drunk people do not like waiting !
No one stands on line for shitty pizza .
I did not even know what to do with my self but dash the usual garlic powder , hot - sauce and seasonings on my slice and dig in !
I was having a relationship with my pizza in south pittsburgh and i did not have to go to italy like julia roberts in eat , pray , love to do that !
I do not benefit from this on a weekly basis , but woman like my friend who has long , thick hair love it !!!
I am not really a fan .
Turns out the delivery guy has not even left the shop yet .
So you can not get bored .
The place ( decor etc ) , is not the best .
I was wary of him trying to up - sell me when he let me know what other repairs our car needed , but he put no sales - type pressure on at all .
When i told him i was not too car savvy and needed to go home and talk to my husband , he did not judge or try to take advantage .
The food is not authentic as green pepper .
Not recommend for people who love korean food .
Want no pressure and a salesman who thoroughly knows his products ?
No up - selling or pressure of any kind .
Today , i woke up feeling refreshed and energized and did not feel the need to run to down my morning coffee .
Never would have thought sauga could provide decent ayce .
Even my young kids were able to find something there that they liked too ( no kids menu , but we made it work ) .
Today i ordered a caramel flan frap , no coffee , with coconut milk .
My kid was screaming since it was a long wait so i had not noticed it was wrong until i drove away .
I was not pleased .
There was no organization , people crowded around the counters so you could not even get through to get ur food when it was finally ready .
One of the servers was incredibly rude and actually started yelling at us because we could not get through to pick up the order .
The food was good but not worth being treated like shit .
This is a nice family owned restaurant and i remember the first time that i went there i did not think it was going to be very good .
I generally go with the classic , such as a pepperoni mushroom bacon , but whatever you do do not ask for extra cheese !
It 's nothing gourmet which is not a bad thing - sometimes you just need a downright dirty pizza and if that 's the case this is a great option for you .
This is where i would go if i wanted ayce and did not want to trek all the way to scarborough to my favourite ayce ( ten - ichi ! ) .
They rush you , they are rude , they are unfriendly ... even for chinese ( yes , it 's a chinese - owned sushi place , surprise , surprise ) service , this is bad - always packed - they do not take reservations for anything under 4 people ( i believe ) and it 's hard to get seats unless you come early ( even on weeknights ) overall , if you can manage with poor service , the food and environment are a plus in my books , and i do not go out to eat in order to get great service ; i go out to eat to eat great food and prince sushi fits in there quite snugly .
We both never tried the place but decided to give it a try .
It was during sunday lunch and luckily it was not too busy so we got our food quickly and the service was great considering it was just one guy waiting on 4 tables .
I think the sauce might have been from a frozen pack and not home made .
Not spectacular , but okay .
We were no longer interested , so i asked them to stop emailing me .
I will never go to a chapman dealership .
Their dough is made fresh everyday , so no hard flacky crust like other chain places .
Do not ask for extra cheese , they put lots of cheese and toppings !!!
Not a great blow out .
The customer service and atmosphere were just as great at this location , unfortunately my stylist was not skilled :(
I asked about a sushi roll and she literally said ' we have like a lot of sushi and like i am not really sure ' and laughed .
I do not think anyone in their right mind should charge $ 20 on bulgogi without any quality sides like fish or scrambled egg , potatoes or tofu soup combinations ... they do not even do that in la restaurants !!
Not only do they have good pizza they have byob and nothing is better than that .
( benny , please do not go ! )
Fun to eat and i do not think i will get over the novelty of it .
I would go more often , but i try not to eat too much processed flour .
If i had to review a sushi place last year , the company would go out of business ( actually since i am not elite , no one would listen to me ) .
I am kidding , do not do that .
First off , we did come with no reservation and they said it would be a 30 minute wait .
Hmm not too bad at all !
We had been there for 30 min and the tables still were not taken .
The hostess was very dishonest and not helpful at all !
Finally my friend went back to the hostess and she refused to accept " no " for an answer and so we were moved to table in a cooler area near the pool but still no shade .
Mind you we never had a table we had just crashed a random group 's table .
It is not that big and the waiters were huffing and puffing about moving tables that were in their seating area .
I mean it 's a 30 degree day with no umbrella and no water .
It 's not that big of a deal .
Eventually we got sick and tired of roasting in the sun and as soon as a group beside us moved , we took over the table despite what every person in the restaurant told us not to do and guess what ?
No one even blinked an eye .
These are not the fluffy buttermilk pancakes from mildred 's temple kitchen , they are just sad flat pancakes with some fruit on top .
I mean is not that supposed to be the main ingredient ?
It did not seem that busy and there were lots of servers and chefs cooking up a storm in the restaurant .
We are usually at this starbucks on weekend mornings and it 's not bad , but forget about it if you are here on a weekday morning on your way to work .
Knowing this , do come here at any other time or if you are not in a rush to get your caffeine fix .
The hot sauce that they serve is not too hot but tastes very good .
The naan is crispy and tasty and does not taste like a brick like the ones at bamiyan .
Again , it 's yet another place i have passed a million times and never had time to visit , until this morning that is .
Not giving myself enough time to look around ( i overslept ) , i just asked for a meat pie and a spinach pie .
I did not have time , so i ate them both cold upon my arrival to arkham asylum ( my name for the place i work for ) .
I am not sure if it was lamb , beef , or a combo of the two in the meat pie , but i tasted bell peppers , tomatoes ( ? ) , and onions and came away with the feeling that i had just eaten the best hot pocket ever , except it was cold and that it was a new variety : meatloaf .
Watching popeye cartoons did not help .
My stomach did not start growling again until about 6 pm .
It did not even need to have the chocolate drizzled on top either .
The crepes were tender and delicate , the cherry sauce was wonderful and not cloying sweet .
Thanks bill , we could not have done this without you !
After we sat , the waiter did not come for like 5 mins .
The waiter did not come to check on us until we were done eating .
Shortly after i received my order of shredded chicken with sausage pho noodle in soup , the same server came back to inform us that they did not have enough fresh pho noodles to cook for my mom 's portion of pho and asked if she wanted to vermicelli instead .
Um , vermicelli is not the same type of noodles as pho at all and curry would have been ideal with pho so that it could soak up the sauciness ... so , no , of course my mom did not want vermicelli with the curry chicken .
The server asked if she wanted the dry pho noodles and since my mom does not like the taste of dry pho ( fresh pho tastes better for her ) , she decided to forgo the order entirely .
However , the vietnamese sausage was cut too thick and did not taste good at all .
No cramp tables on top of tables .
The sushi was good , not extraordinary but good for a visitor with colleagues after work .
The hand rolls were served quickly keeping the seaweed nice and crispy as it just would not taste the same once it gets soggy .
I was not impressed .
You do not see naengmyeon on the menu at places around here typically .
The soondubu had good flavor and was not overpoweringly spicy .
The price was not worth the overall experience in my opinion .
The waiter just started , so i give him the benefit of the doubt with not being familiar with the menu , but our order was wrong when it came out .
It 's pretty good but , not as good as pamela 's .
The wedding soup was the best we have ever had but it had no noodles .
Do not expect to be able to order anything else except pizza here .
Thank goodness no one else was around to hear such a ridiculous question .
Another thing not to expect is meeting benny fierro .
Benny fierro does not exist .
No beer is sold but you can byob .
Both are not bad but nothing really stands out .
I am not sure whether that 's good or bad .
The fees were not outrageous but so you know , any animal that is not a dog or cat is labeled " exotic " .
It 's a turkish place that serves halal meat ( as do many if not most other places in this area ) .
When we went in , it was busy but not so busy that we could not pick our table .
We did not get that chance though .
Then we got just the dip ( no bread ) and the zucchini patties .
Not sure if the dip came late for some reason , or if there was accompanying bread that was forgotten ?
Anyway , the chili dip is not good .
However , i was not completely wowed , especially considering the price , so returning is not high on my list of priorities at the moment .
Since cah was booked to house my fur son for a couple of days i was provided with this facility and was not disappointed .
Bowl is set up correctly , and not just stacked .
She also could not seem to control her smart mouth .
Overall it was not a good experience and it made my friends and i along with several other shooters borderline uncomfortable .
Myself , my friends , as well as my kids will not come back here .
I told one of the owners about the experience we just had at the range his response was " does not surprise me , those guys are arseholes " .
I want sure what to think from the outside of this place , and when i stepped inside it did not help me feel any better .
Never happened .
I do not have anything to compare this experience to , but after our first visit ( and 5 more since ) i am pretty sure we will not be going anywhere else .
Everything is taken in stride ( with some humor thrown in ) and although the awkwardness is never completely gone , it did make my first time experience super comfortable .
Annie is extremely knowledgeable in her field , not only with colonics , but also with natural healing , herbal therapy , and all things internal ( and poo ) related .
Thank you pittsburgh for having such an awesome pizzeria , amazing flavor great size slices and fantastic price , would not eat pizza anyplace else in the burgh
Had he talked to me like this i probably would have been thrown off the range for telling the guy that i was not a child and not to talk to me like one .
Embarrassing them in public is never the way .
No luck with the used car , but one of the managers , kim , suggested i might be surprised at what they could do on a new one .
This is our second new mazda from chapman and both times felt like i was dealing with friendly professionals and not the typical high pressure smoke and mirrors types employed at some other dealers . i 'd certainly recommend chapman mazda .
I like fast breakfast , i.e. waffle house but you can not compare the both .
There should never be a speedy breakfast , an these guys are great with the quality of the food .
Whether it 's getting dolled up for a night out or pampering myself after a bad breakup i am never disappointed .
They accommodated me with no problem at all and even had chocolate waiting for me when i arrived ( i was pretty upset over the treatment i received from the primp and blow i was coming from ) .
She made sure my hair looked great and she never once made me feel like i was taking up her time even though she took me at the last minute .
A few in our group had never even shot a gun before .
We come here every saturday for sushi / hibachi steak and it never disappoints !
My not so fave location anymore .
My hubby never mentions the word mocha.. they kept saying we said white mocha.. the other day we were charged $ 3.95 for a venti white hot chocolate .
We never mention white choco mocha .
I am pregnant and i am craving for a white hot chocolate not white mocha !
They are lucky i am not a hard customer .
Even better with a friend you can blab on forever with and not notice the huffy puffy attitude of staff .
Great crust , not greasy , tons of quality toppings and lots of cheese !!!
Order to go . this place is nothing to look at and quite dated inside - the pizza totally impresses ... the dining room does not . this was the only thing stopping me from a solid five stars .
Will never go back again !
We did not have to wait long for our food either .
We both did not care for the tropical syrup .
We were not disappointed .
Here i am again , one of the hippest brunch spots in toronto and need to admit it does not disappoints .
But need to say that it 's not the best brunch you will find in toronto
Cashiers are friendly but counter staff is pretty un- aware of wait times or what is or is not currently available .
They are not familiar with service industries standards .
Arrogant and obnoxious counter staff . cashiers are polite but the manager behind the counter does not belong there .
As it turns out , i did not need to be concerned at all .
Best pizza on the south side since pizza sola closed ... wish i had stopped here sooner ... fantastic thin pizza , great sauce ( right amount and i am so picky about too much sauce ) not stingy with the cheese ; and i loved putting the remainder of my slice in the brown bag !!!
Although the " treatment " did not totally correct my problem , it did give me relief , which quite honestly given my situation is all i could ask for .
It 's only my second time here but i know it will definitely not be my last !
Not only were they close to me but also had really good reviews online ( i am big on reviews ) .
Even when i forget to follow up with they are shots and appointments they never failed to email to remind me .
Thank you so much and i will never change to any other animal hospital .
I will never go to this location anymore .
Then i could have not only enjoyed a less expensive breakfast , but i would have also had easy access to condiments and beverages - free of eye rolls ( god forbid i ask for a water after i finish my orange juice ) .
Good gracious , oph , just put ketchup on the tables so we demanding customers do not have to put your staff through the emotional torture and physical agony of having to get us some !
I could not tell you what the specific name is of the dish that i had , but it was probably something like pork roti with curry .
You will be served a warm curry with relatively no spicy heat , ( which is not a bad thing ) , and a several pieces of roti that sandwich pork bits , and what i assume is some sort of egg mixture .
But do not get me wrong ; simple flavours done well are often all you need for a filling meal .
Aside from wanting some more elbow room and access to the restaurant 's bathroom instead of the one down the hall , i can not complain .
The food certainly will not knock your socks off , but you will be happy .
No alcohol served though .
I will not go back there after found out my dog 's eye drop was charged almost $ 22 and found out that i can pick up from the walmart pharmacy for $ 4 . blood test , checked out my dog with overcharge eyedropper cost $ 400 plus if i did not have free exam ad , and some military discount .

They supposed to call me back or email today , no phone calls or email .
We truly appreciated his efforts and customer centered focus while not being the stereotypical pushy car salesman .
We would not have bought this car if it were not for bill and his exceptional team at chapman mazda !!
Even the bread was not as fresh .
Not value for money .
Their beef or lamb might be better i will never know i will not be going back .
I originally bought a groupon but unlike the other reviewer , i had absolutely no problem whatsoever getting an appointment .
They are not cheap slices ( $ 4 for plain and $ 5 for pepperoni ) but considering they are so huge and each slice can probably feed you 3 x
They would not take the box knife back , because they do not contaminate , very safety concious .
My husband brian just bought a new car from bill lohmeyer , and he could not have been happier with the experience .
He is genuine , not pushy , and has a great sense of humor .
He took the time to listen to our needs , helped get us a great price , and never pressured us .
I thought the options were good , but overall i did not feel like the quality was as good as some other places i have tried .
The prices are not cheap .
It s the manager with the rude attitude that had us say " never again prince sushi !!! " the 2 star is all on the food !!
Food is good but not worth the bad service that come along with it .
We knew they 'd charge for left over food so we always try not to over order . ( plus i hate seeing food going to waste ) never had a problem with this system until now .

N then i had 2 slices of butter fish sashimi which i thought was not fresh so i did not want to eat ... the waitress question why those were left over n i told her ... it 's not fresh so i will not eat it , she repeated " not fresh !?????? "
.... yes not fresh !
... i could not hear wut he said but she said she punched in the order according to wut i wrote down ... n this time she will let me go , but next time she will charge me ... blah .....
I have no problem paying extra if it was my fault , but serving me too much n try to charge me for it ?
No thanks !
N i guess cuz we would not finish our food n was the only customers left in the restaurant , they did not bother offering us any ice cream .
There will be no next time , i will not go back there again .
Already so full but stuck at the table because u can not finished ur food ...:(
If you are looking for a deep dish style pizza loaded with ingredients and a ton of cheese ( i am not shi* * ing you ) they must use a pound of cheese on the pies they put out !
I do not trust the integrity of a dealership who will lie just to sell a car .
They also were not as acquainting as other dealerships , i had to haggle for 3 hours just to get a price that was decent .
They provided no refreshments even after confirming my purchase of the car .
I have been going here for more than a year and eat here minimum 3 times a month , and i have never had a bad slice from here .
Do not overlook this little gem !
If you are in the mood for greek food give greka pita a try , you will not be disappointed .
The rare beef noodle is okay , the soup flavouring is decent , noodles not too soggy but the beef itself was a poor cut - tasted bad and rubbery .
Also beef to noodle ratio is not that good .
The service is pretty fast when the staff is not too busy watching tv .
I am taken such good care of everytime i am here and have never loved my hair more than i do now !
I have seen , these have no damaging glue , wax or heat , they are so low maintainance and last for up to 2 years !
The 2nd time i did it i did not need anymore assistance and felt amazing afterward .
I can not say enough good things about greka pita .
I went there last week and was not impressed with the process , there were about 6 people sitting at the front desk all playing on the computer and not one looked up when i was standing there waiting to be checked in .
I would not recommend this location it seems like a free for all in there and it was not very clean .
This place is ok , but just that , ok ... nothing great about it , the food is not great but it is not bad either .
This was our first visit but it will not be our last .
Do not be fooled by this restaurant 's shabby appearance .
I will admit , i was not too captivated by the interior ; lighting was dim , seating looked a little cramped and the table tops looked a bit dirty .
I have always loved curry but was never able to handle the spiciness .
Not only was the curry here flavourful but it was mildly spicy , something i was able to handle with ease .
Do not get these guns .
I only give this place 4 stars because my favorite doctor is no longer here .
Personally , i quite enjoyed the tea and should have ordered it earlier ; however , my dad thought the taste of the tea was relatively bitter - sweet ( literally ) and was not bowled over by the experience .
It just did not ' wow ' us .
I personally do not enjoy the pita and salad ( especially the salad ) that comes with the meal so i ask for extra rice as a replacement instead .
There are no servers so you do not have to tip if you do not want to .
Do not come here if you are looking for fancy decor or gourmet recreations of mediterranean food .
Love the clay target center , can not think of a place that could be better .
When we called and asked for a refund they said they can not do that but we can have a 10$ credit for next time .
There must be new owners or staff because this is not the pizza pino i used to know .
I ordered the kost burger which did not disappoint .
Service could not have been any better ...
Wedid not come for sushi and i had chicken yaki udon , husband had teriyaki , and daughter had shrimp plate and ate it all .
I do not know why i had not been in before since i moved to mint hill 1 year ago .
During a no- filre session , i was disciplined for approaching the ( unloaded and checked ) weapons .
What is not fine is that the female range master started to insult me and other customers making comments like " everyone is really stupid today " and " i wish that they would leave " .
I appreciate their overall diligence in keeping their customers safe , but rude employees like this do not belong in a public - facing job .
Never had a bad meal here .
Can not go wrong with any of the dips .
I was not going to post this review , but i noticed that other people had also noticed this so i decided maybe it 's time for green lemon grass to step up and fix a few things about their restaurant .
I will never go back there again .
Which is a big no no .
However , i do not think that any of the staff would win any customer service trophies anytime soon .
They are on the most part unfriendly , abrupt and will ask you directly if you plan on tipping them if they do not immediately see any extra cash on the table .
If you sit here , people walking by our restaurant may think it is full and would not come in . "
I looked around and there were at least 3 empty tables and no waiting customers .
He had no objection at all .
Then i told the waitress i already asked their customer and he does not mind me sitting with him .
At the time of leaving , there were empty tables and no line up still .
Do n't they understand how important customer service is these days ?
Customers do not just buy your goods , they also buy goods along with service . @x%^*!
I was really amazed about the privacy and the comfort you do not feel awkward or embarrassed at any time . they take you to a private room with dime lights and sounds of the ocean you get in gown just when you go to the doctors .
Now i did not use the range but i took a course there and it was great .
They did not have a kids menu but were happy to bring us a smaller portion of pasta for my 2 year old and did not charge full price .
Can not wait to go back or order for delivery .
6 hours later i go to pick it up it had not be done .
I drop it off again 4 hours later no call i picked it up they said they had not gotten to it yet .
I ask about tires he says what size , i saw i have no idea .
His smart ass response well not sure why your talking to me they put four different sizes on those cars so once you know what you want let me know .
And proceeds to tell me they are no longer mitsubishi anyway .
Then says not sure what you are tying to accomplish .
He never apologized .
Such an attitude this place no wonder .
I like denny's ... just not this one .
2 dishes cost $ 20 or so - and i could get the same at a real chinese or thai place and get some real tasting food with actual fresh food that is not simply about throwing some pre-made stuff into a wok and calling it good .
The food here is not bad mind you - but is is not very good either - very average .
Certainly not worth $ 20 ( although someone in front of us had a groupon and that would have been a better way to fly ) .
We will not go back .
I like the concept and the food came out pretty damn quickly , but i probably should not have ordered the pad thai .
It just was not very good .
The flavor was not right and the noodles were pretty mushy .
They have changed my impression and i 'd strongly consider this place when i want chinese food and do not want to venture to the east end .
It was loaded with ingredients and did not taste like msg .
This is not another " congee " place .
They have remodeled and while i can not comment on the food it 's a great place to hang out
My mother in law also told she had been here before and they were treating her not very nicely because her english is not very good .
For apps we tried escargot and onion soup , these were not the best and to be honest the keg does these dishes much much better and for less .
Overall i do not feel the prices are justified and bang for buck i 'd choose keg over octagon but if you are trying to impress for a business meeting or something it could be the place to go .
I do not believe that this sort of service is characteristic of this salon , but i can guarantee that i will not financially support an establishment that is tolerant of racist customer service .
Perhaps i misunderstood his comment , but i think i would be lying to myself if i convinced myself that it was not actually a racist comment .
Their customer service is stellar and i would not go anywhere else .
I do not think i can complain about anything until of course i have my kitchen appliances installed .
I noticed that the ice maker box was not aligned to where it 's supposed to sit .
I was not satisfied , i tried calling again .
I do not want to deal with the installer , i paid spencer 's for this so i expect spencer 's to be liable to me not the installer !
He said they do not deal with spencer 's at all .
It 's between me and spencer 's if i am not happy with the appliance and that i should demand a swap because it was not working on the day it was installed .
He was not even apologetic .
He said " you do not have a choice , let ge fix it , i am in a meeting ... "
I do not deserve this crap from these guys .
They do not think about their customers .
After they made the deal , they did not care a bit about you .
I have never been treated this bad .
With an endless list of bad reviews and complaints about them , i do not know how these guys lasted that long in the valley -- their customer service really sucks !!!
She does not push product but , listens enough to you needs to suggest smart additions to your lineup .
I am sad they no longer carry the brand of dry shampoo spray i like so much , but they have a new product line that i have not tried yet .
Lotus is very clean with a beautiful decor that is not over the top or cheesy .
I greatly appreciate the variety of manicures + pedicures that lotus offers .... all with fresh ingredients such as milk , honey , orange peel , etc . the option of a glass of wine or champagne while you are there does not hurt , either ;-) on the weekends they play dance music --- kind of hilarious but it 's a nice change of pace from typical salon music .
My daughter - in - law called to let me know that they had the keys to the house and it was not very clean .
He could not believe how dirty it was and that on q thought it was ready to rent .
Due to the location of the fire alarm they could not reach it .
Cotter , the owner , the move - in inspection form and the pictures that i took in 11/2016 we can prove the house was not clean nor in great shape when we moved in .
Per # 20 ( b ) ( normal wear and tear accepted . ) # 20 ( d ) " tenant agrees that if premises are not returned in the same condition as tenant received it , less normal wear and tear " .
All reasons for not returning the security deposit listed in the disposition letter were addressed in the move - in inspection form which on q received on 07/22/2016 .
Kitchen counter tops - condition poor , top was coming off on the island . drywall / paint - condition poor to fair , most areas have cracks , paint coming off , scratches on doors , hole in the wall and some rooms baseboards and doors were painted on one side and not the other . landscape and sprinkler repair - the landscape was returned to on q in the same condition that we received it .
The sprinkler system never worked .
The bedrooms were not completely painted the same color so i doubt if these areas had been touched in years .
The security deposit refund is not acceptable and the check will not be cashed .
Article 2 landlord obligations ( 33-1321 ) ( b ) any fee or deposit not designated as nonrefundable shall be refundable .
Per the website there is no state agency that enforces provisions in this act .
If you are planning to rent do not expect to receive your security deposit back !!
The staff here was very helpful and more importantly the product here delivered i could not tell the difference from this location and any of the ones in california other than when i walk out of the door i could feel that az heat i will be returning to try some of the other dessert and drinks they have !
No other issues with waiters or waitresses .
All i really needed was the shuttle to pick up my rental car , no problem .
To our surprise the room had not been refreshed , but we understood and did not really need anything but coffee .
This is a problem with the chain , and not this particulair hotel .
My secret is i come here before i grocery shop so i do not but everything because i am shopping on an empty stomach !
Not just next door .
No casino available .
I have never had this issue with any other hotels where if you needed a later check out , almost all other places would give you one extra hour without penalty .
Not only does this place decided to charge $ 30 for the extra hour .
He stopped by again to check up on us but was never a bother .
I will probably not come here again due to pricy items .
So if you are not looking for anything fancy , stop by give it a try .
No need to report a problem at this hotel , they will not fix it .
The beds do not get updated i guess .
My only complaint ( besides the horrible parking which is not their fault ! )
Is that the menu is not kid friendly !
I am not sure if i am missing something here , but if i am , it 's not well advertised .
Writing this review for my mother as she does not yelp !
My mother may be 65 , but she is not a blue hair .
Dressing is not fully coated and again , $ 18 make me i think it 'd be more special .
It came medium rare just how i asked and the meat is soft , definitely not chewy at all .
Service wise is professional but not warm and welcoming .
There s no wine list so the server had to list it out for me but he was in a rush when listing it so i could not catch anything so i just picked whatever i heard .
Later on when food came out he said next time he would not be able allow us to share the steak because policy is one entree per person .
We understand that but the way he explained was not really empathetic and that kinda ruined our mood too because we are those people who never stingy with paying for food and 24 oz steak is really big for both of us .
You will not find better ingredients or portion sizes for the price that you pay .
However , the last time i we nt i learned that they do not take your order at your table anymore which i was not that upset about at first but soon after i realized that it was a complete pain .
It seemed like they open at 11 and the employees got there at 10:55 and did not think they were going to be busy ...
We found a house with on q. when we moved in the house was dirty , the yard was not trimmed and overall in poor condition .
We chose not to renew our lease .
The floors , capet and house needed to be cleaned or we would not be able to get our deposit back .
The poor owner of the house has no clue !
She took her time , not a quick get - it - and - out - of - my - chair so i can get the next person in pedi .
Also , they charge almost $ 2 to add a hard boiled egg and i was not even sure an en entire egg made it in .
Done very well and not for a bad price of $ 12 !
I am not a huge fan of the che drinks ( i prefer my toppings to take up less than 50 % of my drink ) so my go - to is usually the black milk tea or the jasmine green milk tea .
When i asked about trying to fix a very clear uneven spot , she said she could not do anymore since there was not enough left to work with ... uh , you think ??
I have had my brows threaded many times before , but never ever with such terrible results .
Not homemade like my mom's , but still delicious .
All these complement each other and was not too sweet or overbearing .
Have no problem with it or servicing the homeless but he continued to disrupt us while she was in the back .
Almost did not come in , but so glad i did !
I can not complain at all about the service and the atmosphere of the business was nice and clean as well .
We thought we would stop in for a little treat and i do not remember the thing that i ordered anymore since it 's been a few weeks but i definitely was not impressed with my treat .
I was a bit disappointed that there was not much flavor or anything going on with my drink .
All i got was a drink that did not really taste like too much and left me wondering why i had bothered get it .
The treat just really did not do anything and was a disappointment .
Nice job - waiter was also very engaging , sorry we did not catch his name .
Did not know what to expect , we were on our way back from a hike on south mountain looking for a good burger and beer .
Food was ok , but not inspiring in any way .
Even though the property is near the airport , you do not hear the airplanes taking off or landing .
Be aware though that there are no restaurants in close walking distance .
Will let people know if they need window tint to try out tint express they can not go wrong ...
I did not even dare ask for sour cream , i hope i have at home :( better mexi places in area at half the cost .
Can not wait to come back for music bingo night .
All of their employees are so friendly and inviting , and we can not wait to go back !
Never spicy though .
The food is a little pricey but for me , it makes two meals so i can not complain .
I do not get my nails done very often , but i know the difference between a horrible experience and being treated with decency .
When i walked in , there was not a single client .
Ok i was super stoked because that meant she 'd spend actual time and not rush doing my nails .
Not only did she cut two of my cuticles open and bleeding , i watched another girl come in and be treated like someone getting nails done should be by one of the other nail ladies .
I wish you could have seen her face when i did not give her a tip .
I came here on a saturday night but i did not smell anything unusual but then again i have three dogs .
The only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i have to reserve 5 stars for places like the cosmopolitan . :-)
Tahiti is not on the strip , so if you want to go and not deal with the madness of driving , you should take their shuttles to and from .
The shuttles are not bad - the drivers are friendly and rather punctual , but you do have to plan your days around the shuttle schedules .
The rooms themselves were not bad .
However , the one bedroom bathroom did not have an air vent , which was weird .
Situated close to pickle barrel / no frills .
K47 crab meat seaweed salad - it looked very impressive in the photos but it did not taste that good .
( def. not hipster vibe ) old wood beams , some stained glass .. as i said , tres old school .
Sadly , there was no spicy sauce and no hot chiles .
I will not hesitate to come back here again .
This location is no different .
Service here is a bit slower than their other branches but not too bad .
Would not recommend !
Avocado should not be brown .
There is no ranch dressing or anything creamy .
Though this place was fine as just a hotel , note that it is away from the strip ( that can be a good thing ) and not a resort at all .
No restaurant there .
No bar for drinks .
A very minimal continental breakfast ( not sure which continent it was based on - not north america ) i found myself walking next door to the denny 's and the starbucks a bit too often .
I would highly recommend if you are looking for something tasty and healthy but do not feel like cooking .
However , the food was not that great .
I also asked if i could get scrambled egg whites instead of the sunnyside up egg , which they gladly accommodated me , but i could not get over the stale like tortillas which kind of threw off my breakfast .
Other tables came in after us , and received their food before we did which i thought was kind of odd , but was not that big of a deal because the football games were a good distraction .
I may try this place again for their happy hour or dinner menu , but not completely sure .
They were not kidding !
Can not wait to go back !
The hampton inn is everything you need in a hotel and nothing you do not need .
He respected my time , he was very very knowledgeable , he did not try to upsell me , and he did not pressure me .
He gave me all the info , gave me his card , he did not ask me to give him any info , and he encouraged me to research them at home .
Definitely will not be back and should have trusted the bad reviews .
Zero cleanliness ( ringing people up touching the card machine , people 's debit cards , and cash while wearing the gloves she was wearing for my pedicure and did not change them ) also carrying the cuticle clippers she was using on my feet in her hand while ringing people up .
Did not clean any of the tools between the last pedicure , my pedicure and the next .
I have never wanted a pedicure to just be over and i could not wait to run out .
Do not order delivery .
The end result of my nails and pedicure has always been good but it 's just not worth it .
I still think stores need to think long and hard about the brands they sell and how they stand or do not stand behind their products .
Refridgidaire does not stand behind their products .
Trying to deal with the company for repair was told they have no one in the area to service the refrigerator and that they would have to find someone .
It has been nightmare and three weeks later and no repair .
Notified spencer 's through the website that they sold me an expensive appliance with no local repair support and received no reply from spencer 's .
Will not be back .
Also our servers never seemed happy to serve us and when asked questions i 'd get a grunt or mumbles in reply .
Hung out here at the bar for a few hours to watch a world cup match and they could not have been nicer about it .
It 's $ 36 but damn if it does not look good with grilled cheese and bacon and lobster .
Anyway , overall it is just much worse , and there seemed to have fewer items on the menu too , and one thing other than it s food that really bugged me is : they added 15 % tip on the bill without telling me while waiting for me to key in my pin , had i not noticed it i would have put another 15 % .
Honestly i did not even think i got 15 % worth of service , since everything was slow and cold ( not talking about the food , although what i ordered was mostly cold too ) .
We did not know that tahiti was the sister of tahiti village , when i arrived at tahiti i was like oh no this is a downgrade but you can never judge a book by it s covers i stayed here for 7 days and i will definitely come to stay here if i ever come back to vegas .
Not to mention they have shuttles that will take you back and forth to and from the strip , busses pass every hour .
The strip is not too far from here i 'd say about 10 mins max and if you are going to use an uber it is not expensive at all .
I did not notice children or families that stayed here so it was pretty quiet which is a plus for me .
Definitely come and check this place out you will not regret it and do not forget to say hi to the sweet older hispanic lady that serves you breakfast in the mornings , she will definitely make your day !
First issue : no elevator .
.. never telling us that there is a charge for each small glass of fountain pop ...
Third issue : the steaks were cold , but my friends and family were too polite to complain because they did not want to ruin my night .
She never stopped talking and giggling across the room the entire time pausing to look around and comment to her coworkers .
Despite several reminders that i needed to leave soon , she never stopped socializing in vietnamese nor acknowledged her american client .
Do not waste your time or money .
The pricing was a little high but the place is very clean so i did not mind paying a little bit more also the aestheticians were very friendly !
The person helping was very rushed and did not ask me what i thought about them .
The aesthetician immediately noticed that the nails were not done correctly and was able to fix them .
On our way in an uber and they call saying they are in the parking lot but no one is there .
I reassured them they were new and not very busy .
They clarified there was no one there , including the employees .
No one knew .
I could not have asked for a better first - time experience .
I went to this place for the first time not really knowing what to expect .
It was ok , but not something that i would get again .
I usually get take - out and i think that the sweet and sour chicken would not be good for take - out because it would probably get soggy .
No appointments necessary means that i can swing by any time i am in the area with my wild eyebrows and get a quick thread .
It 's usually more like 15 - minutes if no one else is waiting .
I do not like my eyebrows to be super thin and have not ever had to tell them to respect the thickness .
Please do not go here .
So many options i did not have a chance to try them all but i definitely intend to come back to this place because it is comparably better than most .
They offered me a drink and i did not have to wait long .
I felt like i could not have made it any more clear how i wanted my hair colored .
After my hair was finished and styled , i saw that the color of my highlights did not turn out how we had discussed .
I told the stylist that this was not the color we had discussed and that i did not think i liked it .
She never discussed any of this with me during our consultation and if she had , i would have either decided not to get them or asked her to go ahead and use the bleach .
My highlights also looked very streaky - they definitely were not natural - looking or blended .
I expressed to the stylist that i was not happy with my hair .
That was over a month ago and she never called me .
I thought about calling her myself but she made me feel guilty about not liking my hair , even though it did not turn out the color of the picture or hair swatch , because she said it still looked good .
She had another appointment for an eyebrow wax while my color was setting , but no one had turned on the waxing pot so she was waiting for it to warm up .
This is normally something i would not have thought twice about but i guess it bothered me more than normal give my negative experience .
I have been getting my hair highlighted for over 10 years and i have never left the salon feeling unhappy with how my hair turned out .
My hair not turning out the color i wanted is one thing .
The stylist telling me she would call me and then never following up is what really made me feel like she could not have cared less whether i was happy with my hair .
We did not sit at the hibachi ; instead we did the sit - down with the regular menu .
There are so many options and the portions are not small !
The only pitfall was the noise level , but it 's a busy restaurant , so if you do not mind the noise , you will enjoy it .
The service / quality is never the same .
Making an appointment means nothinf to them so do not waste your time making one .
No crab rangoons .
Would not recommend .
And a drink total was 9 $ not that bad that 's a responsible price .
I got like 7 chips on the side lol .. they should of just gave me none because the chips are not good at all and their salsas are okay nothing amazing .
Also the girl upfront does not have energy and just stands their and waits for you to come up to her to order .
I do not think anyone would ever put 25 cents because one it was dirty and their was nothing in it .
The bathroom was dirty too so i did not understand how these guys get an a when food inspection comes because the place was dirty everywhere i looked .
If you want just a good burrito yeah sure come grab one but it 's not a place i will be coming back to just does not have what i like in a place .
I would not recommend this salon .
The staff are not very friendly and they switch people in and out to work on you .
Would not recommend ...
Do not sign up for any timeshares they offer .
Yet they are not helpful at all in changing the contract or canceling it .
For those who might not want to read my long review i will summarize it .
I got food poisoning from not very tasty and smelly steak .
But their service was not close to the same .
I understand that meat are usually aged in steak house and colour is not always bright red , but this was very dark i could barely tell if it 's medium rare or medium .
But both of the rib steak we order was not very flavourful and was very very very burned .
Do not want to get into details but the four of us spend a big part of our night in the bathroom .
I will not recommend this steak house not only because i possible got food poisoning from it but also because the food was not that great .
It 's a shame that you were suppose to be the only decent steak house around me but i will never visit again .
I am usually not supposed be near fish when it 's cooking , but they cooked it so quick and it was entertaining !
The rental person claimed they had no children except for an exchange student who would only be there for a month ( not an issue , we did not ask if they had kids since it was a 5 bedroom house and expected a family to live there .
Well , to make a long story short , our realtors found out that the tenants had credit issues and could not buy the house and they had children .
( again , not an issue , but we were told differently , which was the issue ) .
So , in essence we were lied to by on q. they had no reason to lie to us .
It certainly was not the tenants fault that they lied .
She would not get back to us in a timely fashion .
She never did end up returning my husband 's calls to this day .
When she would email back , it must have been right as she was walking out the door for the day because it was 9 pm east coast time , which is where we live and we could not reach her after that to respond .
They first claimed there was no microwave ( not true , had pictures ) .
They finally after 3 weeks ( no thanks to rebeccah ) returned a microwave that was clearly not ours .
There was no way the carpets had been cleaned as per the lease .
Instead of rebeccah maybe telling the tenants this ( if i paid for work that was not done , i 'd certainly call the company that was supposed to do it ! ) , she let it go .
There was no reason for that lock box to be there .
They had no right to be in my house at that point !!!!
Next thing i know , they never returned the pos microwave that the tenants returned and had to get it back .
Regardless , there was no need from anyone from that company to be inside of my house by that point .
I would not recommend them , or at least not rebeccah to be your property manager .
But these people lied to us , then would not talk to us , had an unauthorized lock box on our house after my family picked up all the keys !!!
Do not waste time and come here first .
I was told to sit in one of the manicure chairs and was not even talked to until 5:25 .
She did not say anything to me the entire time except " who pay ? "
She did not even remove my old red nail polish , she just painted the pink over it !!
She seemed pissed when i only gave her a 5 dollar tip but the manicure was terrible and i did not get good service .
Do not bother with this place , it 's a waste of money .
Cantonese chow mean was yummy yet could not help but think that it too had an artificial tasting flavour in the sauce .
No hello no greeting just a stoned faced person w a samurai expression asking if we know what we want .
I will never go back to waxing .
Great place to stay in vegas but not feel like your staying in the craziness of vegas .
One thing to note is that there is no restaurant or bar on - site .
So do not think that you will order a little drink by the pool .
There is an extensive room service menu and plenty of places close by to eat if you are not cooking yourself .
Also i would recommend they get a second jacuzzi ... the 1 for such a big property is not adequate .
Probably will not be coming back to be honest but glad i tried it !
Love going here especially because it 's never really busy ( when you go any time besides breakfast ) and even then sometimes breakfast is not too busy .
It 's cheap food , so you should not expect much out of it , but to get good tasting cheap meals .
Good service , plenty of tables , i have got no complaints here .
Could not imagine going anywhere else for my eyebrows or to anyone else but sejal she 's the best !!
As we arrived , there was no host to seat us at a table for my friends & i of 4 .
I have been to a lot of places for pickup and the majority of the time i have to wait and i am never greeted by name .
I tried the avocado ( have not had vivas ) but this was excellent and had a perfect balance of seasoning .
Not good .
Will not ever go back again
Left to go pick up order , received a call from an unfamiliar number did not answer .
Got to the store and was told they did not have mac and cheese at 1:45 pm !!!
It was not good .... on top of not what i wanted .
It was not good .... on top of not what i wanted .
The fish taco was not crispy and it just ran together with the mango , pineapple salsa .
Not sure if i am going back
Probably closer to 3.5 , but we do not get those yet .
There 's no question that the service level is very , very high , but the food felt a little uninspired - even for a steakhouse .
There was no clanking , yelling , flipping , or laughing going on at our table .
Do not bother with this place .
If you are looking for a salad , i 'd suggest going to hello bistro instead ; the ambiance might not be as great , but you have more topping options and get more salad for your money , and it tastes better too .
The salads and the stir fry here are pretty good , but i just can not get over the fact that they do not put prices for their non-custom menu items .
The most recent time i went , my fall harvest salad was $ 12 ( there was not even meat in it ) , and my friends ' stir frys were around $ 15 .
I came her about 5 years ago a couple times and never liked it .
The shop itself does not have much selection for colors , but she makes it work wonders !
I learned my lessons in the past during holidays i never think of making reservations , we usually end up in the waiting list or struggle looking for another restaurant .
If you are a big group , i suggests to make reservations if you do not want to wait to be seated for dinner as this location is extremely busy .
I would definitely come back here again and try the other food they have probably on the side orders , i struggled looking for sweet and spicy side orders which i thought was the chilli turnip but it was not .
I have been a client of marilyn miller for so many years , i can not even count .
She is a fantastic color stylist and i have never been disappointed .
It 's not cheap , but i wear my hair every day , so i think it 's money well spent !
$ 40 for a mani that does not last more than a week ???!
I definitely will not be returning and can not recommend this place to anyone .
This is the second time i am not having a good experience in the octagon !
First of all the food is not that good at all it does not match the high end quality that the restaurant is delivering .
I ordered sea bass and the little tiny piece of fish came with a side of tasteless boiled cauliflower pieces and beans , it absolutely had no taste what so ever , that was it on my plate , i left very hungry and not satisfied for the price i payed for that dish .
Me and my friend came to have wine and an appetizer last time and we got told that for the next time we are not allowed to just order an appetizer .
Never mind that we shared expensive wine with that and out bill came to more than a 100 $ .
I will not comeback to the restaurant again !
Though we got a top floor room , my friends who did not said they had trouble sleeping b/c they could hear their neighbors above them .
The only thing i did not care for was the waitress .
She was only came around to take our order then i never saw her again until the bill came .
I mean , who the hell serves breakfast but is not open at breakfast times ?
But they were no longer serving breakfast .
This one really angered me because the drive - though menu says it 's available from 6 am - 11 am ( laughable considering they are not actually open in the mornings ) .
It should not be this difficult to give them my money .
I will never go back .
I we nt right after work so i did not have a pair of flip flops to wear afterward .
They did not offer any disposable flip flops .
But today , the service was not too good , due to the person who did my nails , she kept doing other things at same time doing my pedicure .
I would give no stars for today but my nails turns out pretty !
I also like the fact that there is no casino on the premises , and my children did not have to endure cigarette smoke .
The issues i had were that one , does not know where to go and there is no signs telling you the building numbers and or names so you do not where you are going .
This is not the same spencers i knew some years ago .
The salesperson rushed me through even though there was not much going on in the store .
He seemed disappointed that i would not be purchasing the most expensive product available .
Have no idea if there is installation , or maybe this was an option , but the appliance is still in the box and turned upside down in the middle of my living room .
Not at all what i expected and i will not be shopping here again .
I normally dread getting threaded , especially if it 's been a while but she 's definitely careful enough not to hurt you in the process !
4 star because the drinks were not that good ... we end up throwing both away after leaving .
The noise level was not too loud .
They were not overdone but cooked to perfection .
The pie was not too sweet or rich .
The breakfast could be a little fresher and less canned but it is free so you really can not complain much .
Unfortunately we will not be ordering from here again due to the lack of customer service as well as the food quality .
We did not go to the rooftop bar because it was cold but i will definitely be enjoying that this spring summer .
It 's not like viva chicken since you have more meats , sides and most importantly , booze .
I do not plan on coming back .
Yes , i enjoyed the decor and the staff member who gave me a pedicure was nice and did a good job on my nails , but i can not say the same for the rest of my party .
The staff member i had took my card for payment and when she came back with the receipt for me to sign , she held onto my credit card and did not return it to me until i signed the receipt and gave it to her .
I was taken aback , as i have never had anyone do that to me before .
There is a $ 1 charge for using card , which i was not told before hand , nor did i see it listed somewhere in the store .
Another staff member who was working with someone in my party told her that her 20 % tip was not enough , and that they charge 30 % for tip and did not leave them alone until they gave her extra cash .
Can not wait to come back .
I do not get what all the stink is about ...
Apparently they have got it under control now , so if you have been avoiding visiting due to this , it seems no longer an issue .
I have not had red bean in a drink since mitea in sd , so i was quite happy to try the one here , and i may even prefer this one .
They definitely do not skimp on the red beans , and it was well balanced and not too sweet .
I go here often because i love how fresh their drinks are , however , this experience was not so pleasant .
This has never happened to me before at this place .
C amon now , please , while you make our drinks wrap your hairs up in a net not just a beanie or a cap .
I was not impressed with the food .
Do not get that roll .
I would not go back for dinner .
The tacos in the end were pretty good , not street taco good but decent to sustain my crave for it .
My daughters car was stolen from the parking lot of this hotel - she was driving back east from california - the manager was off duty - july2nd - the assistant manager made no attempt to help , her -. we have called the manager " wendy " and received no call back !
My daughters car was stolen from the parking lot of this hotel - she was driving back east from california - the manager was off duty - july2nd - the assistant manager made no attempt to help , her -. we have called the manager " wendy " and received no call back !
They made no , attempt to accomodate her - she called the police !
They were very lame - there are no security cameras in the parking lot -. i would never stay here nor would i recommend anyone else to use this hotel or park in their lot - she has lost everything and no call back from manager !

Price for dinner was not cheap either and service was cold as a cucumber .
Never again !
Then we go back to the room and they have not cleaned anything .
We understand there 's a schedule cleaning day , but why did they agree to do it when they do not have plans to follow through ?
The man seemed like he was the manager , and did not even try to help .
The sink and bathtubs do not drain either .
You have no option but to use the complimentary valet and coat check .
I admit , it was a nice touch , although i am sure if you do not want you coat checked you can refuse .
The ceaser dressing had just enough garlic and flavour , it was not overpowering at all - if you have been reading any of my reviews , you know i am all for the spicy ceaser dressing .
That certainly was not the case .
I was very excited to find soursop as an option because i have not had it since i visited florida .
The lady at the counter who 's name i did not get was very friendly and welcoming .
First , our stove / oven did not work when we moved in , so we contacted the company letting them know .
A week later , somebody came out ( i had to take time off of work because they would not come out on weekends ) and determined it needed a new part .
The oven is from the 60s and they could not find the part , so a new one was ordered .
Then the new one was delivered , but did not fit in the island , so it could not be installed .
And of course we can not call on saturday because nobody is in the office .
I work as a gm for 3 stores and i can not always take off of work .
My husband works full time and he can not ever take off of work , so when something like this happens , it makes me want to pull out my hair i am a pretty patient person and i understand that things happen .
Do not hesitate to go with this company they are great !!!!
She would check on us occasionally , but i swear she never smiled .
The only reason i have to give 3 stars is because i was not too impressed with the waitress .
I do not know if i 'd go back or not .
We drove here to find out the location and amenities were not as good .
Plus , our room would not be ready until 4 .
Definitely not the least expensive place in town to get a men 's haircut , but you get what you pay for and they are true professionals here at shine salon !
James is amazing , i have never been to a place where they take so much time and focus on perfection .
This was not the case there , everyone was focused on giving a great haircut and educating me on my hair rather than trying to just push products on me and get me in and out .
Mammoth maintenance could not fit us in before labor day but the day after they were here between 11 - 1 .
But then when things did not work is when i experienced another side of spencer 's customer service .
When i realized my fridge did not seem as cool as should be the store was closed .
The following day i awoke to find my brand new fridge a whopping 55 degrees and the freezer at 65 degrees , not recommended for food freshness .
I called first thing in the morning , sales rep stated he would find out what time they would be able to deliver another refrigerator , then call me back ..... did not hear anything after 2 hours so i called and spoke directly to my sales rep , whom explained to me i was scheduled for the end of the day and they would call 2 hours prior to delivery .
4 pm no call .
When i called and requested what spencer 's could do for replacement of all the spoiled food ( it was a few days before new year 's lots of meat wasted ) i received a cold shoulder not even an apology .
" extraordinary service " as they state is only when you have no issues , not when you really need their service .
Fantastic place to stay if you do not want to , or can not afford to , stay on the strip .
I could not have been more pleased .
Also , they will take you to the grocery store 3 or 4 mornings per week , a huge bonus if you do not have a car .
I am kicking myself for not taking a selfie outside once i left yesterday afternoon so that i could share it here !
He also shaped my hair into a textured , clavicle length wob / lob ( idk what the precise terminology would be here ... ) ; i can not stop swishing my hair because it moves and has that ever elusive volume that us fine haired ladies covet .
Something else that stood out : no one , mark included , tried to upsell me to death with products .
Mark suggested specific products to me because i asked and then did not assume that i would or needed to purchase all of them .
I appreciated how even the ladies at the front desk did not commit assumicide by giving me a total that automatically included all the products and instead supported me in making a decision based on my product needs and my budget .
It is so refreshing not to get the hard sell !
Not a hospitality member .
They claimed to have checked the room for more bed bugs but did not find any other than the one i did , which i took a video and picture of .
Seems to me like they just do not want to pay someone to remedy the situation .
We requested that management dry clean all of our clothes and luggage , they made no effort to help us .
Never heard back from the manager .
We ended up using vacation time to wash all of our own clothes so that we would not bring the bugs back .
It was cold so we did not get to check out the pool which seems to be the only enjoyable thing at this hotel since they want to charge guests to use any of the activity center games as if they are on the strip ( 3 miles away ) .
Do n't stay here .
Left our hotel room at approximately 6:30 a.m. on day 1 & returned at approximately 2:00 p.m. our room had not been cleaned while we were gone .
Today , we left the hotel at approximately 10:00 a.m. and returned after 10:00 p.m. much to our shock and disappointment , upon entering our room after another long & exhausting day , our room had not been cleaned , for a second day in a row .
We called the front desk to notify them of the situation and they wanted to know if we 'd had the " do not disturb " sign on the door , which we had not .
Request a room that faces the airport to watch planes land and leave ( since the views are nothing to write home about ) complimentary hot breakfast sure smelled good ( we missed it by 5 minutes ) only 1 turn to get to the strip , so if you do not want to stay in a casino , and you are able to drive yourself , this is a good alternative friendly staff
I am not kidding .
I have never had that happen .
No thanks .
They will never get my business again -- expensive lesson .
I am usually not a big fan of chain like breakfast places like this , but with that being said my experience was better than i expected .
I walked in , put my name on the list , and got seated not five minutes later .
I had the tuna plate along with their special rainbow roll for $ 50 - it definitely was not worth the money .
I love that the desserts are not overly sweet and you have the option to add simple syrup to your taste .
Not the most expensive i have had , but still a large amount so best kept to a " once in a while " outing .
Sides - seaweed salad , edamame , agedashi tofu dessert - fried banana w / drizzled chocolate , ice cream ( green tea , red bean , mango ) really wished i had noticed the boston roll earlier and definitely regret not getting more sashimi !!
Avoid the grill options that we got , we had some people who did not like raw fish ( sad times ) .
It was good , but not as good as congee wong .
But i am not sure if we would order from here again .
I have had some amazing ayce sushi and this did not stack up .
My handrolls were also not that great as i m pretty sure the seaweed was stale .
I did not end up getting the last 2 handrolls that i ordered but i did not even mention it to them because quite frankly , i did not want them after what i had already eaten .
I also ordered a miso soup and it was just not good .
The service was fast and they were nice enough , but not the best at customer service .
I will not go back again
Will not be back , beverly .
The location is not great , you would not expect a place this good in a strip mall with a del taco .
I would not recommend this place unless you literally want to walk away with a bad taste in your mouth
Generous portions , affordable prices for your wallet , and i got everything to go and they had all of my food cooked and ready to go in 10 minutes - you can not complain with that great timing .
That 's a good sign that the fish does not sit too long .
The first thing that i noticed was that you did not get limited on how much sashimi you could order .
Spicy tuna hand roll - was not spicy and not much taste seafood soup - do not order it .
Just fish bits , mushrooms and 2 small pieces of squid spider roll - seemed like the crab was deep fried a long time ago tempura roll - tasted ok but the tempura was not fresh spicy tuna / salmon roll - decent mango icecream - probably my 2nd favourite dish after the sashimi as you can see , i did not get to try too much since the rolls filled me right up !
I would not recommend this place
I scheduled on a saturday and spencer 's never showed up for that appointment .
But there was no reason i should have had to set up 4 different service calls at my loss of work hours for a refrigerator that was only 3 weeks old .
I even filed a complaint with the bbb and spencer 's never replied to the complaint .
I would not recommend doing business with spencer 's !
So , we are not responsible to reset for you and you are on your own to get that $ 80 service booking or do it yourself .
Why do not you just get a knife and start robbing people on road ????
Ok for the price and convenience but i am still taken aback that the first room i was given had never been cleaned after the previous guests .
I never recieved anything nor did i bother bringing it up at checkout , and i 'd prepaid for the room so it was not applied to that either .
The ac unit was absolutely deafening yet did not cool the room effectively , but it drowned out the screaming people and loud airplanes , so it ended up being a good feature .
I slept terribly , that was more just my own mind not stopping , so i called in the morning and requested a late checkout .
Without question they gave me till 1 pm with no fee .
1 pm with no fee was actually quite generous , so thank you .
Sadly , they did not have tuna on the menu .
Feels like the tempura was not particularly fresh and a bit soggy so the sushi roll that had tempura bits tasted below average .
Even my boyfriend who is not hat picky about food could not finish the pudding .
No problem with the bills and the server was attentive .
The ambiance is not great though , the place does feel a bit dreadful with its lighting .
Here 's some examples of no or slow responses :
No remediation .
Dishwasher not working .
Problem with landscaper not treating dying grass .
Never addressed .
I really can not comment on the quality of sushi , because we never got past the really , really bad soup and appetizers , paid a bill we should not have and walked out .
Do not waste your time at this sorry excuse for a sushi restaurant when one of the best in madison is less than a 1 / 4 mile away .
Phone number listed for the location on central is incorrect - it is for the uptown location - and apparently this location does not offer quinoa or roasted potatoes and 2 sides as the website states .
Unfortunately when i called to book my latest appointment , the receptionist informed me that jane no longer works for idolize .
It was not until later i realized they close promptly at 7 pm , and i felt like a big jerk !!
Our technicians spared no effort in making sure our pedis were soothing , enjoyable , and detailed .
In my experience at other places , the wax treatment is usually extra , so i have never had the chance to experience it until now !
The guy taking my order was very nice but did not know the menu well .
When we finally settle my initial order , i asked about the different fries options but he did not seem to know what they were .
I did not have to wait too long , a couple more minutes and the burger was out .
For a decent sized burger meal between $ 7 - 9 , i did not think it was a bad deal .
There was no pork or onion ring .
Not exactly how the burger was described , but tasty all the same .
But his availability , flexibility , and willingness not to push was helpful .
Many companies save money by having an answering machine and email confirmations for service ; no personal touch .
On the other hand , it tastes extremely watered down , not authentic , and for a hefty price relative to usual prices of vietnamese desserts .
This was not my first time shopping at spencer 's .
This time was not as great .
What i found strange was i never hear from the store .
This time we have to order a part after not even having the product for 30 days .
Again no call from store .
I am a little surprise that the store does not make a point to call customers when something goes wrong .
Purchased refrigerator and shared three hour window i would not be available for delivery the next day .
Would not you know that was the exact time they wanted to deliver and would not budge moving the time later .
Went to coaltrane 's at 7 pm when it was not busy at all , our party of 4 was the only group in the restaurant .
I ordered the pepino salad , asked for no tomatoes , and the other 3 in my party got 1 / 4 chicken and two sides .
My salad came with no feta , no arugula and no salad dressing ( which it was supposed to have on it ) .
Do not go to this location !!!!
My grandson is autistic and do not appreciate the attitude from this specfic woman !
Pretty good , not great .
( if you are a fan of chinese food , do not eat here .
You will cry and wonder why you did not listen to that snarky review on yelp )
The service is not good .
What i did not like , their vietnamese coffee ... yuk .
I consider myself a connoisseur of vietnamese coffee and that ai not it !!!
Now i see that it is no longer there but it shows in my reviews .
I do not work for spencer 's ( never have ) .
Complaints : 1 . ) their phone is down , and has been for weeks with no fix in the future .
The workers there did not seem to care , and told me to order online .
Their touch screen soda machine never has soda in it .
I looked at their ' no calorie ' options , and of the 12 + options , they just had water left ! at 12:00 p.m. in the day !
I do not know if you have been putting your fingers in your mouth or what !
Parking is your standard east liberty headache but can not fault them for that .
Not much of a wait at all and the bowl was great , everything seemed very fresh .
They have their own unique fountain drinks , would have preferred diet coke over their " diet mexicane cola " but no big deal .
It was clean and not over the top , but nice .
The only reason i did not give 5 stars is due to the $ 1 charge for using a credit card .
It 's not about the money but the principal of it .
It 's not posted anywhere that they do not accept checks so you are blind sided when you go go pay .
I was then asked if i would be finished by 1030 because the boss was not here and the staff wanted to leave .
Never been to a restaurant that asks you to leave at the time it closes just horrible .
I had high hopes for this new spot since it 's in my neighborhood but unfortunately i was not very impressed .
We placed our order and the gentleman taking it did not seem to know the menu or how to ring it in .
I told the guy 3 times that i did not want beans on my stuffed avocado .
They have signs up for nye at coaltrane and it seems like they want nightlife but you can not count on that with a tiny little outside bar .
Then i ordered the street corn casserole , i will warn you now it 's not street corn ...
The favor was good if you wanted cornbread but it did not taste anything like street corn .
I am just so disappointed to not see this as a nice place to grab a cocktail .
I would give them a second try but i do not think this will be a regular spot for me .
I have been here quite a few times and today my drink does not taste like it usually does .
So this is a big no no to me .
I probably will not be back for a while .
Anybody who tells you that vegas is a 24 hour town , is either lying or has not tried to find a non-poker bar to eat at , on a sunday , after 10 pm , off of the strip .
After driving home from work and getting picked up , jerry suggested that we drive down by where he lives ( sunset station ) rather than by where i live ( gvr ) - there was nothing open , the cafe inside of sunset was closed until 6 am for cleaning and for whatever reason , jerry does not think it 's okay to take girls to bars for a proper meal .
The only option was denny's or ihop over there and he said he did not care for either , so we drove back up to gvr .
I am not a big fan of denny 's - their food is not very good anymore , so i agreed .
The eggs were not good - they had a thick , congealed , clear layer on top - something i have never seen on eggs i have made sunny side up at home .
They were not good quality and they tasted ... not good .
I do not think jerry was that impressed with his food .
Skip this place and just go to the grocery store if you need food on a late sunday night because denny's will not hit the spot .
Be careful , if you have germany car , this company do my audi a 4 , they broke my mirror ( inside ) the car , but after the day i installed , they said they did nt touch anything , even they are not done doing it , the guy said " please sigb in in yelp and make sure put 5 star , so you can get a discount !!!!
Decent room but was not cleaned all day .
She did not trim the cuticles , or really do anything , so the gel was lifting at the bottom of the nails before i even left the salon .
It 's a fast casual restaurant so no servers which is also a plus to me .
I 'd like to give it 4.5 but for some odd reason yelps does not have halves .
No fizzing , which i guess is a good thing , right ?
Which is great because we will not be disturbed during sleeping time !
Unfortunately , that 's all i got .. we did not spend much time in the room !
We ended up going to a nice resort with a beautiful lobby and a lazy river all to find out we were actually staying at the sister hotel ... the website is very deceiving and does not give any information about the second hotel .
I saw this place open up not too long ago and was excited to try it out .
I am not a panda express fan , so i would not suggest you go there , but you may as well ( considering what they serve here ) !
Do not be deceived ; this is not what vietnamese iced coffee should taste like .
The pho was very bland and inedible , and is the worst i have tasted in my life ( no exaggeration ) .
I just could not get myself to finish this .
The kung pao chicken did not taste as bad as the other two items , but was pathetic for what you pay .
Yet the people next to use said they never even heard us being loud now kids what so ever just a bunch of friends getting together and having a good time and laughing
The good thing about threading is the hairs do not grow back for a while so it s a procedure that lasts , unlike waxing , shaving or any other nonsurgical technique .
I have not had any drink that i did not like .
If you do not want to try anything crazy , they also have ice coffee .
When we received our confirmation we did not realize there were several locations so close .
We showed up and were disappointed being this was not the hotel we thought we booked .
So , tired from the drive we did not want to hassle and decided to stay .
Our whole stay , 3 days , there was not one problem , the staff was more that helpful and friendly at that .
It did not bother us too much , but if i were staying there on business i would have totally called the front desk .
We did not mind being a bit further from the strip , we did not have to deal with crowded parking structures or traffic or all the hoopla to get to our room .
I left the shop , did some research and found that lucio was not bsing me .
Anyhow , i was not completely satisfied , so i called lucio back the next day and expressed my concern .
Not worth it at any price .
I would not recommend anyone sign a contract or enter into an agreement with them .
As a owner i did not know that there were several ways of identifying the type of room without a kitchen .
I feel bad giving bambu a low review because i love their concept and am usually a huge fan of asian drinks but we ordered three different types of their most popular drinks ( added up to $ 17 ) and we could not finish a single one .
The hibachi chefs are friendly , and even if you only have a table of adults , they still put on a full show , which i can not say for every where .
Soooo ... not todd english 's place anymore which in all honesty is not the worst thing in the world .
My coworkers and i have come here quite a few times for lunch and have never been disappointed .
Not a deal breaker , they did offer fresh towels .
However , the refrigerator temperature was unable to stabilize , and seemed to take an unusual amount of hours to get back down after increasing ( warming ) , greatly , at random times for no good reason .
The papers with the second refrigerator were crisp and new ( unlike the first refrigerated that had been delivered , but we did not question it at the time ) .
Was there something they were not telling us ?
Was the first refrigerator the floor model , already returned , refurbished , just to tide us over and keep us happy with a quick delivery , something they were trying to get off their hands , thinking we would not know any better ( and we did not ) , maybe someone grabbed a faulty one by accident and delivered it to us ?
We do not know for sure , but we probably will not shop there again , and no one has said anything to clear it up , they just quickly delivered a new one .
However , even though they advertise this special on their website , they never seem to offer the discount in person when i go there .
I am a repeat customer who always goes during " non-peak " hours , so you might think that by now they would remember me and give me the discount , if for no other reason than i go every week .
It upsets me that they never offer me the discount .
Why advertise it on the website if they do not want to give it ?
If it was not for the location being so close to where i live , i would go elsewhere .
Still not worth $ 16 or $ 18 for a basic manicure , though !
The new york steak and peppercorn steak we order were not bad .
Have not had a food crush like this in a long time .
People are always friendly never too busy and food is typical denny 's dinner food .
Four stars bc everytime i ask for over easy never quite yolky enough .
Their website says they open at 9 but apparently this is not the case .
Should not be too hard to keep your website up to date .
I have dined at my fair share of ayce ( all you can eat ... for the uninitiated ) sushi restaurants and this location does not stand out for me as either above or below average .
Everything was good but not great .
Our orders came out relatively quickly and as far as i could tell we got everything we ordered , no more and no less ( some other sushi places often mess up the large ayce orders ) .
Again , it was not bad , but it just seemed a bit less fresh than other restaurants i have eaten at .
I would not say it 's the best ayce sushi in toronto , not really even that close , but it is a fine place to catch a meal with some friends if you are in the area and pining for some tasty japanese fare !
I thought they 'd just give me a name and phone number but that was not the case .
Not only is the food amazing , the staff is awesome !
Went here on christmas because we did not want to cook at home , and we were definitely impressed because we all ordered hibachi !
He was very deft in his abilities and was funny ( he made jokes about the food ) and if you do not like cooking on christmas , go here for yumminess !
I am not sure if they were employed there , but a woman greeted me at the door .
Not bad , but it was not anything spectacular or out of this world .
I might return again the next time i visit lee lee 's and try the other chè they have to offer , but will probably never order their teas or coffee again .
A few minutes later a server popped her head out and snapped at us " we do not open till 10 ! " , and slammed and locked the door .
Sadly , we did not feel welcomed to wait till 10 am , and we were discouraged from eating here .
Our meal was not the best the eggs were horrible !!!!
When i told our server " leslie " she was very rude about it . never coming back here again !
Since this was my first time , i did not realize that the napkins and plasticware were set up in a central location , so i did not grab them .
Rather than pointing me in the direction of the items and watching me get up to retrieve them for myself , my server told me not to worry about it , then went to get everything i needed for me .
I have definitely had better curry in my life , but i was not expecting anything to knock my socks off anyway .
Honestly was not expecting much .
They sure do not skimp on the scampi .
Sizzling , juicy and tender this corn- fed beef packs flavour and needs no sauce or garnish to set my taste buds dancing .
Enjoying every mouthwatering bite , and engaged in conversation , we do not even notice how seamlessly our attentive waiter refills our glasses .
I can not imagine going to another hair dresser !!!
Yes , they inexplicably do not spell buddha correctly -- what , are they actually trying to brand the word " budha " ?
I put the sauce name in quotes because i did not taste ginger , or any other distinguishing flavor , for that matter ... i am guessing it is not made on site .
Not the service .
I feel the waitress do not have firm grasp of sizing ... for example , we asked how many bowls ( the small asian bowls used in this place ) are typically in the small congee .
So do not worry you will not get hungry .
I think this is like a place you can come day to day , but not the special occasion type of place , and for its price range , it successfully occupies the niche it aims for .
Asked for it protein wrapped but got it with no bun .
Prices will not hit you over the head
I have never died my hair or processed it , so coloring my hair was a huge step for me .
She could not believe that i had been dying my hair b/c it was so similar to my natural color .
In fact , no one asks me if i have dyed my hair ...
$ 45 for the citrus pedicure and you do not get a manicure included .
The website and the manual that they hand you does not clearly state how much each procedure is going to cost .
No dice .
I gave two chances , i am not going back for three .
I have never had an avocado like that .
I can not pick a favorite - it was all amazing we had the crack 'd corn , fire roasted avocado , juan jovi burger , wipeout , and the johnny utah !
And i am picky about coleslaw you will not regret coming in to try this spot out !
( sorry i was so excited to try it i did not take any picks ! ) .....
I would say it took approximately 12ish minutes for the time i ordered to the time i got my food , so if you are trying to grab a quick bite before work , i am not sure if this would be the best place .
Also i ordered the combo which on the menu said it came with a drink , so i asked for coffee but when i pulled up to the window it seemed like there was some confusion if coffee was included with the combo which i thought was strange because i do not know what other beverage you would get with breakfast .
I would come here again if i was not in a rush to get somewhere else .
My only complaint would be that the water takes a long while to warm up , especially compared to other hotels , but it really was not a big deal .
I do not really have any complaints about this location ... will be back !
Little pricey depending on what you add - on ... but somehow i do not seem to mind .
Wow i read a lot of reviews about this place and how things are too salty or not enough salt and not good enough compared to the luxurious pei wei .
We did not notice the cops on the street watching us from maybe a stone 's throw away .
Tight short skirts / dresses , heels , and narrow steps do not go together .
Food came , no confusion with orders .
The food chapter of this evening was smooth sailing and we experienced no problems .
Except , we were n't .
I actually have no words for you , actually that 's a lie , this review is longer than any essay i have written in my university life .
And then he proceeded to tell me that it 's on the kitchen table , he will bring it back , that it has not been thrown out yet .
( as if that last statement was not messed up enough on its own , bout " on the kitchen table , bring it back " ) .
Yelp , i can not even make this shit up if i tried .
I was so flabbergasted and shocked , i did not know how to respond to that .
Oh yeah , and then they asked us to pay for the meal we never ate ( these guys lol ) .
The manager got involved , after 15 infuriating minutes of arguing , they offered a free dessert , i did not want dessert , so it was finally voided .
But in a restaurant as " reputable " as the octagon , who markets themselves a certain way and ensures a " fine - dining " experience , i feel like it should have been handled much more professionally , and the problem should have never arisen to begin with .
( btw , you ca n't split bills here , come prepared with cash ) .
We were never made aware of this over the phone , or before eating even ( thanks again ! ) .
Do not be displacing your anger onto me , i am the one with an empty stomach ) .
Price wise felt a little higher than usual $ 5 but because the place was clean and they accept credit card ! ( they do not charge minimums like most asians places )
* do not need to order the preset combos .
Never again .
Does not identify herself or the company , says the service man will be here saturday , and will call first .
Saturday arrives , no call , i call them .
They do not stand by their product in my experience , their service is horrible / nonexistent .
I will never purchase from them again , and highly recommend you do not either .
Will not go back .
I can not wait to go back .
I went because i used to go to the same store in san jose , cali but this location in chandler does not have the same drinks i used to have .
I do not mind paying more for something i am very happy with .
The end product has no comparison .
Good tacos and burritos , can not beat the 1.99 tacos even if you get " tns " taco neck syndrome .
The system did not print a receipt .
No biggie as i did not need or plan to pay for two .
Or maybe this hotel simply is not that good .
She said ' i do not know if we have those .
I will call you back .'.... never called back .
Never got towels .
Do not know if she did not know what a bath mat was but since there was one in the room , i know the hotel has them .
This is what i got .... beds barely made , dirty floor not cleaned , sofa bed not made and a stack of 5 bath towels ( room came with 4 originally ) on the counter .
Not put away in proper location , no face towels , typical number of hand towels .
Did not bother to tip after that .
Other than not being able to sign into hilton honor wifi and not getting any help from girl at front desk was the issue of getting kicked off every day .
Do not know .
Not near anything you 'd want to see or do .
I certainly would not walk anywhere from this location especially if i was a woman .
Can not imagine how the other customers are treated and what their rooms looked like .
Will not return and will not recommend .
Update : i called back to schedule another appointment with jane and was told rather abruptly that she no longer worked there and that this location was not taking appointments because they had no esthetician .
With multiple locations , i am surprised there is not adequate staff to cover them in situations like this .
At this point my mom had left to go to verizon because my phone was not working right , so i did not have my phone .
So i could not call my mom to make sure it was okay to get new nails .
The ladies where screaming at me telling me my mom was right there but she was not .
So they asked me what my moms name was and i told them so they started screaming her name and i keep telling them that 's not her .
I personally do not think they look better at all .
Also i asked for rounded tips and they are not even close to rounded .
If you do not want to look like you are not helpful and unclean you should not have workers siting in the pedicure chairs and a million people that come from the back of the store distracting you .
The workers should try to be nice and not make your fingers hurt .
Finally i will never be coming back and will never sugest this place .
No longer todd english .
No raw bar .
No pot pie .
The enchilada sauce is not your typical enchilada sauce from the can .
I do not know what it is but ricardo 's keeps me coming back !
The staff is shy which does not bother me , and this place gets packed during lunchtime so beware !
Not really a hang out spot , so i do not see the price is just ...
Does not make sense .
Yes , the hibachi chef needed a little more practice , and the service was not quite 100 % , but the food , atmosphere and overall experience will keep me coming back .
Not only delicious , it 's presentation is one of the most unique i have seen for a sushi roll .
- breakfast included - not too noisy given that it 's by the airport cons : - it got a little cold so we turned on the heater , and once we turned on the heater , the whole room started smelling like gas .
No bueno . - further away from the strip all in all , i would stay here again , given the right price . :)
Also , no products were pushed on me , which i totally appreciate .
I have never had such good experience for threading before .
Your skin would never feel irritated after threading , it does not pain much too .
Do not know what i was scared of in the first place .
Of course do not come here expecting a fancy shmancy hotel .
Regardless , the woman was very sweet and informed me that she could set us up with an earlier check in as our room was not ready yet ( it was closer to 1 pm ) .
Only difference was that the room that was ready was listed at a smoking room and she was not sure if it would smell .
Complete with a comfy bed ( not the hard mattresses with funky pattern sheets ) , flat screen tv , dining table , microwave , fridge , dishes , jet tub and a hefty amount of towels ( i hate calling and asking for more ) .
The room did not smell like cigarette smoke at all !
Sure , it is not on the strip , but that was the least of my concerns .
We were informed that the hotel offers complimentary wi - fi , it either always had a problem connecting or it would connect but the internet was not working .
If you are just taking a quick trip and / or on a budget and you do not mind not being on the strip , totally book this hotel !
I understand i came at a busy time but if they did not have time then they should have given a realistic wait time rather then rush me through .
It upset me and i was not even the person waiting .
Never come back .... miss todd english
My haircut is great - could not ask for anything better !
The only reason i did not give them five stars is because of the price .
We understand this place has not been open long but there were some things that could definitely use some help .
Even when we told her that we had never been there all she offered as information was that they had general seating , hibachi seating , a sushi bar and a regular bar and asked us where we wanted to sit and then handed off a menu so she could take a call .
Not a bad thing , just something that we were not expecting .
It was not really making our experience better since it was so bright so we moved to one of the granite top tables still in the bar area .
Oddly enough , the stools / chairs for the granite tables are bolted to the floor so do not worry about scooting in to be closer to the table , you can not !
For anyone who is larger , those chairs will not be comfortable because they are very narrow and just close enough to the table to not be comfortable .
On the other hand , if you are smaller , still not a comfortable seating situation because you will be too far from the table if you sit in the chair instead of on the edge of it .
It had way too much curry powder and turmeric in it , and not nearly enough salt , acid , or cumin in it .
On the bright side , the fish was fresh and cold and did not have any off flavors to it at all .
Despite the fact that she was not busy ( we waited to make sure she did not have anyone to wait on ) she took the notes with a huff and shoved them under the hostess station without even looking at them .
Ordered salad and they sent it with no dressing .
I have been out of the state all week and had no food in my house where do they think i have the dressing to cover their mistake ?
Then after fighting , they only returned 9.00 of my salad , that is not the price .
Our only complaints were a smell that never went away in our room , leading us to buy a scented candle and a room spray to help it go away .
Overall , the smell , the lack of elevator , no drying rack for dishes , and the older and too firm mattress are reasons why i am giving tahiti resort four stars .
Checkout coaltrane 's if you not already done so !
Can not wait to go back !
I do not know where to start ...
This has to be one of the worst eating experiences i have had in vegas ... i will not even attempt to refer to it as dining .
I ordered the egg white omelet that was so grease - laden i could not taste anything but dirty grease ; the omelet was brown instead of what you anticipate an egg white omelet should look like .
We also noticed the amanager ' was in the kitchen expediting the orders .. that is never a good sign and when we asked to speak with him , he made eye contact and seated other unknowing patrons , never returning to speak with us .
The wings are the tiniest chicken wings i ever had , with absolutely no sauce , and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars .
No napkins on the table ( all of the bins were not refilled , on any table ) and the upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead of helping us ...
Dinner on a saturday night after an afternoon visit to codescape and sunset drinks at thirsty rabbit ; i was surprised that it was not that busy , but guess they are still developing a customer base .
I do not live nearby , so would go out of my way to eat here , but a solid option affordable option while neighborhood .
They were not crowded so service was super attentive and quick .
If you ever frequented the previous tenant , john 's country kitchen , you will not believe this is the same space .
( i hate it when you get an avocado that 's still kinda hard because it 's not ready yet . )
They did not have quite the kick i was looking for , so i we nt back to the counter for their salsa verde .
I would have liked a little bit more salsa verde ( it 's killer !! ) for my avocados but did not want to look like a total fat kid by asking for more after i already downed one container 's worth .
Do not get the carne asada fries or the tostada + taco combo .
1 ) carne asada fries : first , the cheese was not melted at all .
Second , the carne asada had no flavor .
2 ) tostada + taco : tostada was not flavorful at all .
The taco was similar to the tostada , except their was some type of meat which also had no flavor .
However , i wanted a healthy smoothie that was mostly fruit , so i would probably not go back .
No seriously , i dropped nine dollars ( tax in ) for the l 4 lunch special here today and i walked out with a huge bag of food .
Someone does not really like the environment because it is plastic and styrofoam aplenty but i guess you got ta do what you got ta do .
Not too inventive of a menu but all your favorites will be there .
A while ago i had ayce sushi here and i remember that being pretty great - a lot of stuff you would not normally see on the cheaper take out menu ( ex. butterfish sushi ) .
Not saying that i would not do this in my house , because i would and i do , but i am not really sure that 's appropriate for a restaurant .
Well , let tell you this is not a typical hampton inn.
I told anrew i was not 100 percent satisfifed .
When i checked out on 1/4/14 , i expressed my concern and not being satisfied .
Trays were empty , and it did not matter on the tme .
Also hot food was not hot , and the cold was not cold .
At that point i am not going to check my order to see if it correct .
After getting home , it was not right .
Not the best technician was talking about how often she has sex and penis size with another customer .
Nails are also never consistent .
Our group of eight were not impressed by the hibachi service .
Our cook gave a mediocre show at best and did not interact with any of our group .
It was around 25 bucks for steak and scallops so the price was not too bad .
I would say if you want to try it do it on a week night when it 's hopefully not so busy .
We would not rush back .
I was weary of going here because of other reviews , but i am honestly not sure why people reviewed this place so badly .
I recommended you ask for non msg , and i usually feel tired and bloated after eating at congee queen , so now i say no msg !
Food will not be as salty
The food was decent , but not for the price .
If i were you , i would not waste my money or time with this place .
I hope weekends are slow and this is not representative of the quality of fish i just ordered .
I would never come at dinner but for lunch , it 's worth it .
Not great quality of sushi .
The tempura was decent , but again not worth it for ayce dinner at basically $ 24 ( tax included ) .
Never going back .
There is no communication .
I guess our landlord is not willing to fix anything !
Renters have no friends !!!
Not a bad spot if you are looking for fast service and a diverse selection chinese food .
Just do not bank on the quality .
At 9 pm , i was starving , and congee queen did not disappoint with their speed .
The other dishes i probably would not get again , but i would be open to try some of the other items on the menu .
Just a pain to try to get a hold of anyone , and they do not seem too eager to fix things ... and when your fridge / freezer goes out , you want it fixed asap .
Also , i do not think i have ever seen a company that has an " f " rating on bbb .
They did not even do that 2 times , however , on halloween they did say they 'd be with us in a min after we stood there for 7 to 8 min .
I do not know why the waitresses would not seat me .
When we moved in november 2015 , the oven , dishwasher , furnace , and bathtubs did not work .
On may 16th we notified on q that the air conditioning did not work .
We are still living with no a /c and we have no idea when it will be fixed / replaced .
These people do not care .
I would not recommend using this company to anyone .
I bet if you had to live , cook and sleep in 90 + degree temperatures you would not be saying " we understand your frustration ... " you would be actively doing something , anything to provide some alternative for us .
As for keeping us up to date on the process of the unit - you are not doing that .
The last was an email stating your surprise that we were not notified that the unit was to be installed wednesday .
Well today is wednesday and it 's 94 degrees in the house and you never contacted us to tell us that it will not be installed today .
Is not against state law to not provide a/c to a tenant .
Also , there 's a gym -- which is not common in smaller hotels .
And not only did i have a mini refrigerator , i also had a microwave , which is not very common .
My only complaints ( room # 162 ) : snug tub / toilet area ( door almost bumps into toilet ) , no light in shower , the linoleum floor appeared dirty and the comforter was torn on one side -- old and needs replacing .
Location is not ' great ' with airport noise ( seems to stop around midnight and starts back up around 5 or 6 am ) and it 's about 20 mins to most casinos on the strip .
There is free breakfast served each morning and i was very pleased with the selection ( not continental breakfast ) .
Note that you can actually see the airport runway but the sound of landing planes never bothered me .
Her customer service is outstanding , i never worry when my house is in her hands .
The higher end tint which was about $ 600 is a 3 m tint that guaranteed no fading and a lifetime warranty .
The place gave us no hassle , and the waiting was not all that bad .
No waiting , no hassle .
Even when it was our problem and not theirs . the rooms were perfect , the place was very clean , the location was great .
That may be true according to the receipt ( it 's not even written clearly , the fee is under " freight " ) , but shane wrote up our total cost on a business card , and he definitely told us we 'd get $ 100 back .
I spoke with the manager , larry , and he 's just positive that his sales people do not ever misrepresent anything .
I guess he has not actually bought anything from them .
Again , they have a " great " argument - their installers are not responsible for anything except the line they replace , because houses often have worn - out parts .
I have now spent $ 110 more than i expected , so their " great " prices do not beat the other stores now .
I also purchased the extended warranty from them , so i hope i do not ever need to use it .
Still i thought it was good enough to eat - nothing special but not too bad .
Only a 10 - minute drive from the strip meant we did not have to ditch our friends , and having a mini-kitchen in the room meant we saved some $ $ from pricey strip drinks . ;-)
The things i am not thrilled with : the quality of the nail polish - the last few times i was there a good portion of the polish was very think and the rest had been clearly thinned down .
We were not doing anything extravagant - just some shopping - and i looked down and noticed on over half her toes the polish was missing .
I am not a super conservative person , especially in this arizona heat - but when i can see all your goods - i m not a fan .
I do not care how cute your figure may be , nobody needs to see your ass cheeks hanging out .
I also do not like that nobody ever introduces themselves or wears a name tag .
I have had a lot of bad experiences with salons and my thick , short hair so i tend to go to a salon once and never come back .
I have very thick hair and she did an amazing job with thinning it out , and did not get annoyed with the weight like many stylists have .
The food will never look like the picture .
But with the 2 - for - 1 entree coupon ( check out any area weekly magazine ) , it 's not bad .
It 's never usually too bad ( 10 - 15 mins ) , though , for a table for 2 .
Four dollars extra for " longer lasting " nail polish ( not even gel ) is a bit ridiculous to me .
Conveniently located just at the edge of the ttc network , it 's easy access and a great post - work stop no matter how late i get off work .
On weeknights there 's never a problem getting a table , but make reservations on the weekend if you are set on coming !
They are decently staffed but things get busy - as i have come more often i have gotten to know the servers and they are all very nice and genuinely trying - it 's just not a kind of restaurant to be super polite and wait your turn - raise those hands and wave and get their attention !
The items i do not recommend include their house special stir fry , mango chicken and tiger shrimp , and garoupa casserole .
Refreshing for the warmer months of the year and always on the house , so do not miss out !
I did not give it 5 stars only because i waited for almost 45 minutes with a scheduled appointment .
Furnished with a flat screen tv , sofa , large sink and bathroom area , closet with iron and iron board , king size bed - i did not hear a single airplane while i was staying there , which surprised me considering how close we were to it - location wise is perfect .
Since i am from washington the heat was not being very nice , haha .
Went in not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised with the food .
Service a little awkward but it was obvious she just has not had a lot of experience yet !
Since i had never been here before i told the young man i had a groupon and he explained to me how it worked etc .
I can not wait to try wok box again soon .
No one was helping eachother just standing around .
Never coming again .
Do not recommend at all
However , aji sai was not half bad !
The restaurant was not packed so our food came out fast .
They have pretty good filling - to - rice ratio in their sushi so it was not just a chunk of rice like many other ayce sushi places in toronto .
As extensive as the ayce dinner menu was , there was no seafood motoyaki !
And no oysters either ... =(
However , this place would get four stars if it was not for the rude service stint at the end .
When we handed her our order form , she said that would be the last round ( i have never seen limits to ordering rounds at ayce places ) .
We were almost done anyway , and we did not want to keep the group of six waiting , so we finished our ice cream and left .
When i got back to my office with my lunch , they had put so much sauce in the box that it leaked through and i did not notice until i set the bag of food on my desk .
It was not an altogether terrible rage inducing experience .
And in terms of styling it myself , i do not do more than towel dry , scrunch with some hair products , and maybe put it halfway up ( or in a ponytail for the gym ) .
No joke .
I was ( nicely ) mocked for still having the same hair dryer from college and for not owning a brush ( that 's right - i was still using a comb for my tresses ) .
Overall , my ( three ) helpers were very sweet and said i did a wonderful job since i have virtually no experience with drying my hair .
All were very knowledgeable and friendly and did not make me feel like a complete idiot , which was a task for them , i am sure .
( i am korean and my eomma would be like " what the truck is this ? " ) kind of reminds me of trader joe ethnic food but if you like the real , authentic deal then this place is probably not your speed .
Not really impressed with the bowls .
He showed us a great 4 piece , frigidaire black stainless steel kitchen set with a price that can not be beat ( about $ 2,000 total including delivery ) .
We would not hesitate to shop here and with him again again and will recommend it to all our friends and family .
He could not stop raving about how good it was .
Not sure if i 'd say the same thing if i had just do not the " restaurant " portion .
Do not expect to walk through the door without being greeted before you are the whole way through the door .
If you have not checked it out do it today !
I stayed last weekend during the iheartradio event and i can not complain .
Towards the bottom you can slightly see some cars parked but for the most part it was wall and poop outside the window definitely something no one wants to wake up to in the mornings .
It s been a few months since the cut and it s grown in so nicely , i have not had a haircut i have loved this much in a very long time .
Tl ; dr beautiful interior and good service but this old fashioned establishment is not worth the big bucks .
Service was very attentive but not perfect .
Although our orders were written down , the sides were messed up and the servers blamed the food runner on the mistake when it was not he who punched in the chit .
I never felt like they were ' doing me a favor ' by serving me as you sometimes feel at high end restaurants downtown .
No chips on shoulders here !
Now , the food .. the garlic bread , pickles , olives and hot peppers were very good , but that 's not what i am coming for .
My rib eye was cooked as i had ordered it but it did not see even one fleck of salt before it hit the grill .
The eye of my rib eye was not tender .
The ribs i tried were well cooked , not the overcooked mush that releases from the bone with no effort that most people seem to think good ribs are like .
I came here 17 years ago for my 13th birthday but i do not foresee myself visiting again in the next 17 .
This place is usually very good and not terribly slow , even when busy , but the last two times my fiance and i have ordered from here it has been very slow and the service has been poor .
I attempted to order on postmates , and i guess i started my order before they flipped the " too busy " switch so was a little confused when i was not able to complete the order .
Instead , we called in a pick up order and were told the wings would be 30 minutes , which would be alright but i 'd rather not wait , so canceled that part of the order .
I wish i would not have , though because the order we went with took longer than that anyway and was of much lower quality than past orders .
Instead of an apology they just said " omg we are busy " even though it did not appear to be the case .
Salesman was wrong about the fridge having 2 ice makers , but i blame myself for not opening the lower freezer to see this amazing 2nd ice maker .
Delivery was on time , i just had them set in the garage as the home was not ready for them to be inside , friendly guys .
Spencer's has no customer service when it comes to this , in fact they do not even take the time to talk to you , just refer you to the extended warranty company .
In other words , i do not care sir .
It has been 20 days , and my fridge is still not repaired .
I will never use spencers again because of this 1 issue .
If you get a great deal , go for it , but do not buy the extended warranty if you value your time .
Not even remote .
*** but *** if you walk in and do n't have that expectation , then , as grub goes , it tastes just fine , especially for the price .
Honestly a huge shame they can not figure their business out .
We have been going for 6 years and have always recommended it , but will not go back .
- avocado salad served with no avocado .
- spicy salmon roll served with no spicy sauce .
- rolls were wrong and when we gently corrected the waitress , she started pointing at a menu item in an effort to prove they were right , only to realize they were not .
- confirmed they are under new management , who clearly have no clue how to run a restaurant .
I have never experienced something worse in a restaurant than the last two visits here .
Do not waste your time and money going here .
This place is not that great .
Considering blush is just down the road , lotus does not even try .
Second , they do not include a hot stone massage with their standard pedi ( and it is $ 32 ) .
I felt like i did not get enough soaking time on my feet and enough massage time .
I would not choose this place over other locations .
Have major hair meltdowns when it comes to hair and hair not being " did " correctly !
My do needed some major attention since it 's not use to the weather / climate of the south .
He really worked it and looked at all levels of my hair -- there are different levels when it comes to curly hair ... all those that have curly hair understands that no mans land in the back that does whatever the f it wants to .
But that would not keep me from coming back .
At one point , he scared the hell out of me , he used a technique i never saw .
With curly hair , it needs to be cut a certain way to no look like a triangle of curls on a head .
I can not believe he asked me if i wanted to go curly or straight !
Not this girl ...
All those curly girls out there will understand this -- we are so particular to our curls and styling , almost no one knows how to style our hair -- so this is a real test .
I am not sure if i will ever allow another man to run his fingers through my hair because this is marks masterpiece !
The woman was sweet and not chatty and had a pleasant smile .
I am ushered to the drying area with no goodbye , no offer for any water , or any warm remark .
With not much guidance on where or what i was doing , i burn my hand on the black light and leave in frustration as there is no one in a 10 foot radius of me .
0 /5 tl ; dr - i would return for a pedicure , but you could not pay me to have a manicure .
The place was not too terribly busy and i was seated immediately .
This was not the best chicken sandwich i have ever had but it was still very good , as it was flavorful and well - sized .
The coleslaw was not good at all but thankfully that was just a tiny part of the meal .
No drink specials either ... even though it was dead inside and mid-week .
There were also several people smoking ( including the off duty employee ) which made the patio a place we 'd probably not go back to in the future .
Not only did kevin do an amazing job on my appliances , he was very professional and helpful to ensure customer service and satisfaction was to my expectations !
Thanks for the nice stay hampton inn. nice staff , good nights sleep ( although you can hear the airport , but hey , it 's the hampton inn las vegas airport so not a big surprise ) .
Reused bedspreads freak me out and they do not have that here .
The cleaning staff was really great and i never saw them .
No annoying push to get out so they can clean your room .
When we moved in november 2015 , the oven , dishwasher , furnace , and bathtubs did not work .
On may 16th we notified on q that the air conditioning did not work .
We are still living with no a /c and we have no idea when it will be fixed / replaced .
These people do not care .
I would not recommend using this company to anyone .
The guy who waxed my eyebrows did not even make them even .
Not sure about acrylic nails though .
The tacos al pastor we are not traditional al pastor tacos but overall it was decent .
I had a dine - in at the store , but one of the ordering screens was out which was not a big deal .
I am experimental when it comes to haircolor , and if an experiment does not come out the way i want , they totally are willing to fix it .
Let 's now talk about what shine is not : it is not a modern spa type atmosphere , or cold , clinical or systematized .
It is not a place where the stylists are too cool for school , nor trying to crank you out in 30 minutes ( though they are busy ) .
It is not a place where you can get nails done for a full beauty experience ( unfortunately ) .
It does not have a giant waiting room .
It did not bother me when they ask me if i need products ( though they do not push certain ones like aveda does unless you ask for a specific usage ) because although i was a lifetime head & shoulders girl , i discovered some of their products really are better than store bought brands and worth the $ . bottom line :
I had a year lease in fountain hills , and it was a nightmare , in the first month i had to take 6 days off work ( not one accommodation ) to accomodate them , and had to threaten to sue them to get them to fix back mold in my unit .
I will file a complaint as soon as i can actually see what they decided to deduct , because naturally they can not tell you over the phone - it is worse than third grade .
I have never made an appointment , but i have never had to wait more than five minutes for a mani or pedi .
I could not be happier and plan on remaining a faithful client !
I have had tint done on one of my cars before and it did not come out like this did .
It was flawless and the front windshield was not cut crooked .
I do not know about their customer service because we never encountered a problem , but i can comment on the workmanship .
Been here multiple times for special occasions and have never been disappointed .
I did not make an appointment , but i did call ahead .
While appointments are not required , i always call for one - this salon is quite busy & calling ahead versus " walking in " ensures you will not have to wait more than 5 minutes @ most .
I can not even begin to explain how great this little spot in central is !!
Now , not so much .
Will not be back here again unless they can get their food quality in order .
Had to try the honey bar ( who would not ) also a great treat .
Trust me , you will not be disappointed .
The vietnamese coffee was kinda gross , but i should have not expected much from the kind of place it is .
Unfortunately , i probably will not be back for a while because i no longer work in the area .
Looking at the menu , there was not much selection but i still managed to grab some of my favorites .
In a way it could be a good thing but not when the table may not be in agreement with some choices .
Well the food is okay , the service was decent and the cleanliness was not up to par .
Was not mixed in .
But dennys i was not feeling it .
Was not satisfied at all .
Looking at the menu outside almost scared us away because it is really pricey but thank god we did not .
I ordered the veal oscar , which i did not know if you could order like steak ( medium rare , medium etc. ) but the waiter was kind enough to explain to me that it was cooked one way , but it is usually cooked medium rare- medium .
It only took 2 hours to get my car tinted here and the job that they did was flawless the thing i was happy about as well is that i have a lifetime warranty with them so let me save you the headache and the frustration on searching for a place that is worth your money and get it done here , you will not be let down !
Brought my car in as a walk - in , fit me in the schedule with no problem .
The price quoted was exact , even though i had no appointment ; they did not pressure sell either .
Not great and not worth the money .
The continental breakfast is a joke , they do not even have real milk for the coffee .
The pool is not very big .
The tvs are old and not even flat screens .
Do not mistake this place for the tahiti village , which is a bit nicer .
I would not stay here again .
Have not been upstairs but it looks cool from outside .
Why even offer morning or afternoon if you have no control ?
Wish i would not have bought all what i did from them .
I have purchased from many stores ; best buy , pruitts , room store and never had these problems !!!
The meat did not have any flavor other than the watered down teriyaki sauce .
I really like that sumo had some dishes i have not seen elsewhere such as the okra and the grilled squid .
I would go back to try the hibachi on a special occasion and i can imagine going back on a tuesday for the specials but it will not become a regular for us .
I do not have much to add except that it 's a denny 's !
It 's always open ( and of course it 's greasy and not super clean , it 's denny 's for crying out loud ) .
Over the course of our stay , i have never experienced more rudeness and incompetence from hotel staff .
They never come back to pick it up ( happened 5 times over two days and i ultimately had to go down and find someone who was around the corner ) .
I asked for two more and the staff person rolled her eyes and said they did not have any more .
Not a sorry or anything .
There are more instances of rudeness , but there is no need to reiterate here .
Thankfully no tomatoes !
Not a fan of the medium .
We were in the mood to have some diner food on friday and our two year old was a little fussy from a short nap so we thought why not go casual and see how our neighborhood denny 's is .
I ordered the cinnamon pancake breakfast and the server suggested that i get half bacon and half sausage since i was not sure which one to choose .
She had no answer at all except " that is how it comes " .
She informed me that the bill was 31 dollars and i said " that does not sound right " .
Without any inquiry she printed out an itemized check , handed it to me and aggressively said " i do not know , you tell me " .
I do not know if the check was right or not .
That was enough for me to know that our business is not appreciated .
With all the options on eastern , there is no need to give this denny 's another chance .
I just moved back to the area after several years away and the old salon i went to did not have availability , so i yelped shine and my visiting - from- philly sister and i made same - day appointments .
Waverly looked at the clock and said since i was not looking for something dramatic she had time to do the color that day .
Instead of doing a typical salon - style blowout ( which i could never pull off on my own at home ) , waverly commented on how much she loved / was jealous of my hair - type and worked wonders with a diffuser to bring out my hair 's natural texture -- this is huge !!
I did not look too much at my hair that night as i went out right after but the next morning i was slightly disappointed , i wanted more color and i felt that i got more top layer highlights than a full ombre .
I have never had the technique done before so i did not know really how to communicate what i wanted .
I himmed and hawed over whether i should call back because i liked everything that was done , but i did not feel it was enough .
So i called and left a message for the manager , who was not in that day , but who i got in touch with me promptly .
I was nervous showing up there because i did not want to be perceived as rude or a prima donna .
I talked with waverly and she said that because i came in initially with a more natural look and no color in my hair that she held back because she was not sure how dramatic i wanted to go .
She did not skimp on the lovely scalp massage , she took her time , and fully styled my hair - on the house !
Waverly is a very sweet woman and a skilled , talented stylist in cut and color ; she did not make me feel awkward at all about coming back .
I do not know what the put in the ingredients .
Can not thank her , or on q enough .
I.e. did not accept receipt on my phone , asked for confirmation number so i gave that after waiting on phone 10 mins for it , then they said that was not good enough that they needed an email of receipt with confirmation .
Idc whose fault it is just do not make me jump through hoops while i am trying to get to the airport .
Some places turn you away , they never have .
I would never go back .
Scallop was good , but one of four did not have bacon wrapped .
Never asked once how thing were .
I am not a picky guy normally , but this place really disappointed .
Our delivery guy was over an hour late to dropping off our appliances ( did not get to our house until after 7 pm ) , he was very unprofessional , we asked him to unbox the appliances and haul the boxes away and he just opened them for us , which we could have done ourselves obviously .
And to top it all off , our range was apparently damaged and was not delivered with everything else , which we were not informed of until the delivery guy was at our house with everything else .
Needless to say , once we get our range we are never doing business with spencer 's again .
Update ; our range was supposed to be here today , i was told by 2 people yesterday that it would be delivered today because they " have a bunch in stock " and we got a call this morning that it will not be here until monday .
They also keep trying to charge us for installation that we did not have done on our appliances .
I 'd probably go back if i were in the neighborhood , but would not drive miles out of my way to go back .
There are not too many of these places around , but we love coming here for lunch .
Our pedicures were done by new people , and were certainly not as good as they used to be , my polished chipped within a week , and the pedicures seemed rushed .
This never happened before !
The last time we went he did not have a manicure because danny was gone .
I have had my nails done at so many other places , and never had them done as well as vincent did them !
We will not be returning .
To be honest i did not really like it but i can see why it 's so popular .
Not a fan of the new renovation .
Now no free popcorn anymore , the lobster roll is meh , and the service was super slow .
I had the pretzel , that was pretty good but not worth the trouble of going out of our way to come here .
Probably will not be back , tried momkfuku in the cosmo and that may be the new regular .
And then 10 minutes and saw no one !
The person that i assume is the manager , who greeted us and took our drink orders when i first arrived , and then was not seen for the rest of our time there until just before we left .
He did not seem to want to take no for an answer to the question .
You never get a second chance to make a first impression .
Would not recommend this place .
I honestly can never go wrong with bambu .
It 's suitable for those who are not used to open to trying new things .
Can not rate highly enough .
There was not really any people there and the girl up front did nt seem like she knew what she was talking about when i asked her some questions .
I guess you can not order anything unless it 's che .
Was not impressed , the chicken was average at best and the shrimp was awful .
The menu is mainily steak and seafood - i do not think there 's much for vegetarians - sorry michelle a. the food was really good !
- i ordered filet mignon for my main - ( i am not a steak expert but i thought it was good and everyone else seemed happy with their meals as well ) two people orderd lobster tails - they are enormous and looked really good .
Called before my flight took off and once i landed in vegas .... no shuttle waiting .
I will never stay at any hampton inn again and neither will anyone i work with .
It 's been 5 days and bubbles are still there all over , it did not disappear .
They do not waste people 's time to come back for errors like this .
They have lost my trust and would never leave my vehicle in care of their hands again .
I do not want anyone to experience the same thing like me .
No biggie as that is the stated check - in time .
Not much parking on the side of the building where the elevators are located so we had to park on the opposite side and walk all the way down the hall -- again no biggie but would be nice to have an elevator at each end .
They have a good all you can eat selection , however i am not a fan of their sushi because it does not taste fresh and it 's cold and dry .
Not much to say other then it was amazing !
It could not of been better .
All in all , pei wei will not be seeing much of me anymore !
I get that it 's not fine dining , but this was on the low end of what i 'd consider pub fare .
He proclaimed loudly that he did not want a discount and did not want to make a big deal of it but that it was the worst quality pastrami he ever experienced .
He really did not want a discount , a refund , or a replacement - apparently he just wanted to lecture every single staff member about the evils of low - quality pastrami and the perils of buying your meat from the lowest - cost bidder .
Do not come here if you want to enjoy delicious food and good service .
The server took 10 minutes to get us our hot tea and never attempted to clear away any of our empty dishes , they were piling up and it was a mess .
I can not speak for the hibachi service since we were in one of the party rooms but the party room service was very mediocre .
Value : you are paying to be entertained and not for the food here .
Feel free to come here if you are looking to have fun and do not mind eating bland food .
Anyone who is on a budget and can not afford an $ 85 dollar hair cut ( that is with tip when most master stylist in town charge $ 70 per cut ) rush to this talented lady before she starts charging the same !
It will not be long .
Extremely unfriendly and they do a terrible job i had asked them to redo my nails twice and still they kept layering on now polish which was creating ripples in the paint and after waiting in the salon for over two hours i decided just to call it quits , the salon is filthy they do not use individual pedicure kits at one point the technician was working on my pedicure then stopped and went to the lady next to me to work on her pedicure while wearing the same gloves .
Ayce , so do not expect sushi to serve your royal guests at your dinner party .
It 's not quite " mad men " and " goodfellas " old school , but it 's about as close as you can get .
I have been to octagon a number of times and have never seen or been served by a waitress .
The wait staff appears to consist entirely of males dressed in suits and ties - does not get much more old school than that .
Now , vegetarians , vegans , and other individuals who do not consume red meat need not read any further .
Not the most extensive i have come across , but it was varied enough that i do not believe anyone would have a difficult time finding a nice wine to go with their steak .
And personally , i can not think of a better combination than a great steak and a fantastic wine !
After stuffing my belly full of beef , i had absolutely no room for dessert so i can not comment on the quality of the desserts .
The parking lot was really busy ( likely because of the mall ) but it was not busy inside .
At that point , i just no longer want to order further and just wanted the bill .
When we got the bill , there is a default 15 % tips which the service itself does not deserve it .
Did not put my friend and i next to each other , even though we came in together and they were empty ... they do not know acrylic tips vs gel tips .
Never again .
This certainly was not the worst experience , but wanted to share with yelp users as there are many more nail salons in the area that do a better job .
The staff was not extremely friendly or welcoming .
The girls talked to each other the whole time , rather loudly , but not the customers .
It was a long massage which is ideal to me but did not use pressure at all so that was a let down .
I felt bad and she patiently waited for the woman with the other customer to finish while the other two ladies sat around , laughed , ate , etc again , not an awful experience , but with all of the salons in the valley , i will not return to this one .
I was drawn in by the excellent reviews and they did not disappoint .
It was a little painful , but it was over so quick and not long and drawn out like tweezing .
The renter trashed the place and onq did not hold back enough of the deposit to pay for everything .
Do not make the same mistake .
There are no slot machines .
The prime rib was served cold and it was not very tender .
The sides were very limited and basic with no effort on the presentation .
Generally , considering the price the food does not impress .
A few of those issues included : cold food ( which i noticed was mentioned in other reviews so this dennys must think it 's acceptable ) , running out of our drinks and not having them refilled a single time during our meal , and having our order messed up .
I needed a new place to get my hair did , because the whole " letting students do it " was not working out .
I can not write this review without bragging on how great i looked so , please , just bear with me .
Despite the fact that we had to double process my hair to change the colors , i did not come away feeling like i had straw for hair .
In fact , my hair has not felt this soft and smooth in a year .
They listen , they are all sweet and professional , it 's a great neighborhood , and they are prices are not outrageous .
The only reason i did not give 5 stars was because of how long it takes to get an appointment ... but i would much rather wait and have shine style my hair than anyone else .
The beans tasted straight out of a can with no spice or flavor .
Not impressed at all .
Not better .
No wasabi or ginger .
Until then , thanks but no thanks .
If you are looking for a window tint place give them a shout or even swing by and check them out you definitely will not regret it !
It cost slightly more because they use real fruit , not the powdered crap .
I would give zero if i could , i would never recommend this place .
I walked in the door and there were 3 ladies sitting able to work , but had not one customer inside the place .
Not one lady got up and offered to clean it up or even help , they were busy yelling at each other about me dropping the polish .
I asked for one more towel to finish it , so you would never have been able to tell it was dropped but she would not give me one more .
Now , i am certainly not the first person to ever drop a polish bottle like this , but it was my first time ever .
They had no plans of trying to make me feel like it was okay or that this could ever happen in their shop .
No customer service skills whatsoever from any employee / owner in the place .
I paid $ 32 for the deluxe pedicure and was not even offered a design at the end .
The job was terrible , she was extremely rough ( maybe to show me she was really mad at the dropped polish ) very rude people technicians , and the place was not clean .
Some kind of roach was on the floor by my chair which i took a picture of but do not know how to post it .....
If you want to come to the usa to live and make money , you should try treating people nicely and be friendly to customers even when you do not feel like it !!!!!!!!!!!
You never know who might refer lots of business in the future , or who might write an honest review of your crappy business !!!!!!!!
Marilyn and i had a discussion about my color expectations , she made me feel so comfortable in the decisions we made together that i could not wait to get started .
However , the restaurant was not full and yet the service was quite disappointing .
The food was not exceptionally unique and often times over salted .
The prices for the wines are also reasonable and not heavily marked up .
I do not think i would recommend eating at this place , and i doubt that i will be back here any time soon .
The place looked fairly cramped , but was not so bad once we sat down .
At first it was not noticed , as you spent the waiting time talking with friends , but after a while everybody became anxious .
Some of our orders never got to us ( probably lost with the influx of all the orders ) , and one of the members of our group even heard the waiters talking in chinese , saying " these kids eat too much .
Super elusive or may not even exist .
Not only is the salon fabulous , chic and clean but they were gracious , kind and made my experience wonderful .
He even moved back an appointment in order to finish up my cut and style ( so sorry ! ) but i appreciated not being handed off .
He spent nearly two hours with me recommended products , but not in that pushy car salesman way and discussed how we can both work together for my hair success - sigh .
Do not tell the owners but i would have paid double for that experience .
Go somewhere else ... jr burrito with cheese and beans had no cheese , burrito that i paid for extra beans to be added was missing the beans , súper nachos had no cheese and some sort of wan na be guacamole ..
For my friends looking for a good burrito or taco place like my self , that know true mexican food this is a no go !
No more !
They were hot but not too hot .
This place has a line of people waiting to put their name down for a table , and i do not get it .
We watched staff avoid our gaze the entire time , i guess no one wanted to wait the table ?
It 's things like this that just make me not want to return .
I did not complain , i was very hungry , and just wanted to eat .
It was not a deal breaker .
Although when i asked for a small refrigerator to be brought up to the room to keep my medication in , they informed me that they could not accommodate my medical need .
I asked for a manager , but apparently there was no one on duty to assist me for over a hour .
I did not know what it was until i took off my sandals to walk over to the bed , and i stepped in a big damp stop of carpet .
What if my blood sugar gets really high and they can not get it for me in time .
I do not think they understand the reality associated with things like this .
5 minutes later , she came into the business center and handed me room keys and said " ill have a refrigerator to your new room in the next 30 minutes , do not book somewhere else " .
I went up to my new room and it did not smell bad !
I answered and she said " we do not feel that we can meet your cleanliness standards , so we are going to refund you and you need to vacate the room " .
Surely enough , she said " i am going to have you escorted out if you do not leave in the next 5 minutes . "
I went downstairs to speak with her , and i asked her to explain how she can do that because i do not understand .
I could not help but start to cry from the way she had treated me .
When everything was moved i we nt back to her and gave her the room keys and asked if i could sit in the lobby to call corporate and use the wifi to book another hotel since i am not from the area and it was 115 degrees out side .
I told her that she city was totally booked , to which she replied , " i know it s not my problem .
They told me i would not be refunded for 48 hours , and in the mean time the entire city was full .
I will never , ever , stay at this hotel again .
Do not buy fridgidaire products .
I have had a stove crack out , a dishwasher control panel go out right after i bought it , a dryer hinge that wo nt stay closed and a microwave that started arching for no reason at all .
Spencers guy are cool people but not there fridgidaire products .
If you skip dessert or do not order alcohol be prepared to feel judged .
We could not resist because you pay little , but get a lot for you are paying .
The waitress that served us was also on top of everything making sure that my friends water and my coffee with orange juice were constantly topped up until we said no more .
Full bar upstairs with a nice patio so i definetly can not wait until the weather truly breaks .
Do not go here !
I was not sure if he would like the whole thai / asian concept .
But he finished his food before me and did not speak a word while eating it which means he was digging it .
I still love this place , however i just got a chimichanga and it did not have any sour cream or guacamole which just makes this a deep fried burrito .
As a new mexican , this is not the best mexican food i have had .
Not even close .
It was not even close to a spicy dish .
I literally could not find anything resembling pepper flake .
The other dishes at the table did not look all that spectacular .
My girlfriend did not eat much of her dish .
They get high marks for service but the food just is not that great .
I will never go back .
I have never had to wait a long time even on saturday mornings .
They make my nails look natural , no weird bubbles or thickness .
I have never left disappointed .
Wrong rice , no sauce for sweet n sour chicken , charged us for a large adult order for my daughters kids portion .
I have been back maybe 3 more times since and it has not been the same .
The last drink i ordered was sour ... which i felt like was done on purpose but i had no idea why ?
I feel like there should be recipes for making their drinks but i am not getting that consistency ...
Do not listen to anyone else 's review but mine .
She said it 's not delicious .
I did not eat much because i was full easily .
It 's not very big and twice we came with a group of 10 so we sat in the far back up the stairs .
It appears to be a chain of aji sai in the city and i have not been to the others before .
Sashimi is not as good as the other places .
I did not know what to expect and i was blown away by the wait staff ( totally professionalism ) and the food !
It is a place i can go and have supper when i do not feel like cooking .
I go in for my appointment only to be informed that the woman i booked with no longer works there .
They claimed to have called everyone who had an appointment with her to inform them , but i never received a call ( i even checked my missed calls to make sure ) .
I did nt have her blow it out at the end because i had already been there for over three hours , so i did not see what it looked like immediately .
I know coloring is expensive , but balayage is no longer some new thing that you can mark up so absurdly .
So that itself was not thrilling .
But it happens - it 's definitely on me for not verifying the price first .
In all 5 years of highlighting my hair , no one has ever messed up the color .
The stylist brought me back in 10 days later and fixed it and it 's better , but still not quite what i wanted .
After all the hoopla with the appointments and the unsatisfactory execution , combined with the steep price tag , i will not be returning to shine .
This was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded and now i will never go back to waxing .
I did not have to wait long to be serviced and the facility has very chic decor and also looked and felt very clean .
No pain , irritation , or marks left behind .
We had a great stay here , except for the wifi not working , which really was not a big deal for us ( there 's a starbucks next door ) .
She was a little grumpy ... but it was nice to stay somewhere where the sounds of slot machines did not reach our room !
Not very large kitchen but it worked for our party of 4 .
Driving by , one does not realize how much they pack into this place .
Color , cut ... the annoying baby hairs that just will not behave .
I would not be surprised if her old customers drive all the way to the queen city to keep her as a stylist .
Cost-wise , it 's not in my budget to come here on the regular .
For some people , probably not an issue .
Like many other customers before me ( i am sorry now that i did not read the reviews )
Goldwing service came out and told me that the high priced dishwasher detergent i bought from spencer 's would not work best and told me to buy other products .
I called goldwing and they never returned my call , they are only open monday - friday .
I have had several other service calls for the same issue to no avail .
Ok , i spent $ 980 of my hard earned money , you want more for and extended warranty for a product that never cleaned in the first place ?
The product never cleaned the dishes period !
The other one we tried , was not one we would order again .
They have a large selection of sushi and rolls , but very few sashimi options ( no tuna ; crab stick is not sashimi in my opinion ) .
I do not go for luxurious atmosphere ( even though i find the salon to be as clean or cleaner than many others i have been to ) or unlimited polish colors ( they have hundreds of colors as it is #bringyourowncolor ) .
Then try telling them you do not like how they are performing the service .
That 's not unreasonable .
I took off 0.5 cause it was so dark in this restaurant that i did not see this bump on the floor and almost tripped which would result in some embarrassment .
The lighting was a little too dark for me but i do not mind .
As for the main meal , how can you not order their steaks ?
Generally when i order my steaks , i always order it one down of the doneness i want ( ie. if i wanted medium , i ask for medium - rare ) only because a lot of places never cook steak to my choice .
Not with this place , i ordered medium - rare and it came exactly that way !
Nice and juicy , not too salty , it was just right .
Dress code is business casual so do not be going in your sport shoes or sandals as they probably will not let you in .
Now , why the day clerk and the van driver could not have told me that , instead of lying about " bad traffic " due to non-existent construction and an imaginary accident is beyond me .
Now , while i can not fault the hotel staff for the rudeness of the customers in the room next door to mine , i do fault the day clerk and replacement van driver for lying to me about the shuttle .
If they had simply told the truth and set a proper expectation about the delay in picking me up at the airport , i would have had no complaints at all about the hotel staff .
It is a new restaurant and owner ... not todd english anymore .
Will not be coming back .
The pool was not really that great .
It was small and not that fun .
At 6:18 we still had not been picked up .
Well we asked for the manager to call us , i left a vm and still no call back .
But i would never stay here again .
Not to mention , i love the salon itself .
( not to mention you are given copious amounts of wine )
For me , i am dead tired from a long night at the poker tables and i am knocked out so it does not bother me .
First morning , could not get used to plane noise and could not get back to sleep - my fault !
Not bad for $ 50 on hotels . com on a labor day weekend .
Our delivery guy was over an hour late to dropping off our appliances ( did not get to our house until after 7 pm ) , he was very unprofessional , we asked him to unbox the appliances and haul the boxes away and he just opened them for us , which we could have done ourselves obviously .
And to top it all off , our range was apparently damaged and was not delivered with everything else , which we were not informed of until the delivery guy was at our house with everything else .
Needless to say , once we get our range we are never doing business with spencer 's again .
We both tried two of different kinds and were not disappointed .
I do not mean to make it sound unappealing but then again congee is porridge that is shared across the family .
The kids were not huge fans of it .
Note : pictures in the menu do not always match the food served .
The server was terse , busy as heck and in a bit of a rush as if he was also manning the porridge in the kitchen and did not want to overbook or overboil it .
I can not recommend them highly enough !
Not one , not two , but three glasses of wine were offered to me as i awaited my appointment .
It was good in the past , apart of that they are not good in serving the proper order .
After that 30 minute wait , the room they assigned had not even been cleaned and was somehow mis-communicated by housekeeping .
... we decided to go to this denny 's because 1 ) it was late and not many other places served breakfast food 2 ) tired of going to our usual places to eat .
Only thing , make sure you sit in a non ventilated area so at least your not covered in goosebumps and chills lol .
The primary issue i found was the total lack of at&t coverage , the crappy wireless in the lobby that can not sustain a skype connection , the in room wireless is overpriced and also horribly slow .
I do not care what people say .
Not enough anchovies and garlic .
The garlic bread was just toasted bread , with no taste !
Dry , tasteless , and no au jus .
Auto tint express is the best window tinting shop that i have ever been too and i highly recommend this place , do not go anywhere else .
Do not order anything else .
Do not order please . overall , just order steaks here and you will not be disappointed .
Do not order please . overall , just order steaks here and you will not be disappointed .
Not this time .
Will not be coming back to this location .
As we waited ( 30 minutes in ) i noticed that other tablets that came after us were being served including the table next to us that just sat down within 5 minutes of me noticing that we were not being served .
Also if you notice that you did not get your entire order at your table at a timely manner , do not check with the server because chances are , they probably forgot to punch it in and they will not even tell you that .
So pretty much at the cash out , the server was debating why i did not follow up with him and in my mind i was like " uhhh , i know your dirty secret of how you cover things up so ... " pretty much it confirmed a lot of my experiences before at this location .
Management did not bother to offer to comp our meal , or offered anything for our bad experience .
Will never come back to this location
Food was pretty good a little pricey for almost 10 bucks you only got your box dinner enough for one but no drink or egg roll not even fortune cookie . but it was good i have to say that it about the same had a panda express but they garnish it with some fresher things .
The food is fresh they do not freeze anything and what i appreciate is the pride themselves on freshness .
The " make it grain " salad is spine chilling the combination of beets and sweet carrots , wheat berries and quinoa atop the arugula bed brings a new kinda freshness to the pallet that words just can not explain .
The food is so colorful even if you are not into vegetables it 's ediblely attractive and the sauce blends will leave you smiling after every bite .
We arrived late night for an early flight in the a.m. the staff just was not very welcoming .
Stayed in much better hampton in n's and as a hilton honors member i was not treated as such .
Disappointment but you can not win at them all .
Not accommodating on getting us a cab at 5:30 a.m. the staff said it would easily take 45 min to get a cab .
Even their shuttle service that runs 24 hrs a day ... only runs on the hour ... that does not make sense .
I am all about hospitality and to me , at least at a late night check in , this place did not have it .
I ordered cracked corn , with extra cilantro , a malibu taco , blackened fish , no lettuce , and a standard taco with steak no lettuce .
I will not be back .
So i have not eaten at a denny 's since high school when it was the hang out spot back then .
I do not know why , but do not judge .
We noticed that all the other patrons were senior citizens , which we did not mind because it made for a quiet dinner .
The only thing that we were not too fond of was that our side salads were sad .
Prices are a little expensive , but if you are craving chinese food , this place never disappoints .
Do not be afraid of the johnny utah , it 's killer !!!
Michelle tyler went completely above and beyond today to assist me in the situation i had and i am super grateful and i could not be more happy to recommend this company to both tenants and homeowners alike
I have never been this happy with my color before .
There are a lot of hotels in vegas , good deal or not try to avoid this place and save yourself the head ache .
Actually , there is no customer service at all !
They took no care to wax properly .
The spoke in another language the entire time and took no opportunity to greet us at all .
I would not recommend this place and will never go back .
Unattentive service , poor attention to the food and not worth price .
The service was pretty below average too , besides taking our order and getting us water , they did not come ask about the food or anything , even though the restaurant was kind of empty .
Not to mention it was hard to wave someone down .
Definitely better options in the area , i do not recommend this place .
Wonderful place , will eat again no doubt .
The receptionist can not find our reservation through booking.com and would not accept the online reservation screen shot showing confirmation reference .
Email arrived but the receptionist can not read some chinese even though the confirmation number is english .
Now the receptionist has to consult an off site supervisor as they still can not locate the reservation in their system or do not know what to do .
With no explanation , we were upgraded from a studio to a single room for our entire 9 days stay .
No scrambled egg or bacon .
It never came , and you have to call and talk to the front desk again and again to remind them if you need the service .
I had a groupon for the facial , but can not wait to come back again .
So far have not run into any thing too dramatic of problems so i do not have anything negative to say besides the positive .
No more .
" my boss will not let me do that " , came the reply .
That request has never been a problem at any other restaurant -- fine dining or otherwise .
No more .
No more .
When we went in june it was $ 17.95 we will not be going back
Love the fact that they precut the tint and do not cut directly on your car window .
You 'd never guess that this place once burned down and was rebuilt - the old school atmosphere is certainly still there !
The trainee that made the salad for the first time apparently added too much olive oil ( which i did not notice at all ) and the manager who walked by apologized profusely and made a fresh one for us himself .
The bacon is not overly - salty , and complemented the enormous scallops perfectly .
I was pretty full at this point , but i could not help myself and finished this extremely tender and juicy entree .
They do not always have this available , so call ahead and reserve your pie !
The crust on the bottom is perfect - not too hard , and not too flaky - and every bite you will taste coconut !
For cheesecake enthusiasts , this may not be creamy enough for you .
I do not know , but i was expecting somewhere around $ 300 based on how much we ordered ..
The prices are good and you get your food really fast one weird thing is that you do not get your napkins until they bring your food to you which is odd but this is a cool little spot that is good for breakfast lunch and dinner
Hence order chinese from a place that we typically would not go to ( live in etobicoke ) .
Congee queen has never disappointed us in the past and i am happy to say it did not disappoint this time either , even with take - out .
We were given a complementary milk for my son , and when my toddler kicked his shoe off the balcony ( where we could not see it ) they gladly hopped off to see if it had fallen underneath the deck .
I did not go inside so i can not talk about the customer service or location , but based on food alone , i will never go back .
The shuttle service may not have been the fastest but gee gosh willickers batman !
The complimentary breakfast is also a bit nicer than the ones you normally get but still not amazing .
Not so impressed with this particular hampton .
My wake - up call never happened , i could not find the coffee pot and when i finally did ( located on an inset shelf in the bathroom behind the door , they only had decaf available .
My husband and i went here last night for the first time , and the experience did not disappoint !
I figured it 's sunday , and it may be crowded , but i will not have to wait long .
I greatly appreciated an early check in because i did not have to be at my account until later in the day .
I immediately called the hotel and was told housekeeping was closed and there was no one to access the locked lost and found .
They directed me to the voice mail which was full and would not accept new messages .
I asked to talk to a manager he took my name and number and said he would check skip ahead to 1.5 weeks later and 2 manager calls ( one went to voicemail ) and still no response .
Not sure why this hotel has such a disrespectful person managing but i suspect he would do a better job at a dollar general .
Would not recommend the hotel or inept manager .
I was stuffed after the meal , i could not look at the dessert menu ... so can not comment on this .
Total came out to $ 11.87 not bad for the amount of food i got , plus awesome company . i guess it was slow at this time , so sabrino came by to chit chat and see if i needed anything .
My husband got very sick from the garlic sauce , i am eating mine now i tried to have it on the side but it 's extremely salty now and there must be a different seasoning added in because it 's making me puke just be aware that your not alone if you think it taste different .
It 's changed and it 's no longer what i will be consuming twice a week when i am in east liberty area .
We do not eat meat so we know it 's not about bacteria ( hopefully they are not cross contaminated cooks - i do not believe that of them but if this is your business , i would strongly advice looking into it making sure the products being used are right )
It is nerve-wracking deciding where to go , but do not hesitate here .
They did not try to upsell me anything unnecessary and they were thorough in their inspection before and after .
The most recent experience not as great ...
I ordered a to go salad , yes it was dinner time but it took almost 20 minutes for it to be ready and then i got home and realized half the toppings ( nuts , cheese , etc ) were not on it ...
Although it was not bad , it was not particularly good either .
Also , the fries were pretty limp and not that hot .
You can not have a good burger place if your fries are not crisp .
You just can not .
Which is not my personal favorite i am a well done type of person .
So if you go and do not like medium well ask the server if they can cook it a bit longer .
I did not read the menu where it stated that they cook their meat like that .
No complains here !
We had the crab cakes which were good and the clam chowder which was quite thick and had that almost gelatinous quality when it cooled down a little - not a fan .
You are not allowed to share entrees - my sister and i were going to split the lamb chops but ended up ordering from the lighter menu instead .
I had the salmon and she had the chicken parmesan which were okay , we do not eat beef .
I have always been challenged in terms of styling my own hair ... manual dexterity has never been my strong suit .
She called herself a professional which she does not come close to .
Kim 's so called professionalism should be accounted for and i would not recommend this nail salon .
At move out they witheld a portion of our security deposit for items that were pre existing and documented or did not exist .
On q charged us $ 185 to clean a 16 " x 16 " dirt stain on the deck and charged us for oil stains in the garage that were not seen at our joint walk through at move out , they had no pictures or proof that these stains existed and they were not on the invoice from the maintenance company .
I would also add that the maintenance company they use is their own company which would appear to be a conflict of interest and would not allow for objectivity .
I needed a table to fill out some paperwork and i did not want to sit in the car ( but i should have ) ..
The blinds look like they have not been cleaned in forever !!
If i were eating there ( never ) i would have been more than a little freaked out .
Yes it is a chain , so no points there , it is the same as the last time i had the misfortune of being in a dennys ...
I waited a full 1 hour and 14 minutes ( i timed it ) even though i made an appointment ; had no consultation with a super rude guy -- seems to be second in charge next to the owner in the corner .
But do not worry , he put some glue on it and moved on .
Do not go to lotus .
I used to look forward to todd english pub for every trip to vegas , now i would not bother coming back here again .
The teriyaki chicken came with an odd combination of vegetables that did not taste good with the flavorless sauce .
This was our first visit and it will not be our last .
Sometimes , do not you just want a skillet breakfast smothered in gravy for dinner ?
My new ge washer that died after 6 days was not something spencer 's could resolve .
Hampton inn really does not get enough credit .
First i arrived into vegas about 12 pm no need for taxi , just called the hotel and within 15 minutes they had a gentleman pick me up .
I had seen this location before , but never had stopped in .
The reps / agents move things quickly and efficiently , i do not think i can think of a simple problem i have ever had with on - q.
It sounds like some tenants on here have had isolated experiences that i have not had so i wanted to get on here and add something positive !
There were issues with the grills and so it took a long time to actually get food but the food was great so i can not fairly take away a star .
I usually do not eat bacon but i do here only .
It was not salty and not fatty at all .
The only thing that i did not like is that it is next to the airport literally .
We never had a problem finding parking even if we get back to the hotel late .
I would not agree with the $ $ $
The meal was excellent the steaks where cooked to perfection and what i am more amazed by you can order anything off the menu and not be disappointed .
My wife and i had a 24 oz rib steak on the bone which is generally difficult to cook properly since it is very thick and bone usually presents a problem for most people but not here .
The reason i am not giving it 5 stars is that the building may be old but it should not be this stuffy even at full capacity .
You can slightly hear the planes take off and land but for me it was not a problem , since i live on the landing approach to bob hope airport in the los angeles area .
The temperature of each dish was just right and i actually ordered too much food because i did not know how big their portions would be .
( this is definitely not a complaint . )
You can not go wrong with this place .
Centrepoint mall is not the most hoppin ' place , but cq is definitely a good excuse to swing by .
Either for a walk in ( cause i have not looked at my face in a bit ) or to make an appointment .
If you have never tried threading , but prefer to get waxed instead they have that too .
They are amazing team they know what there doing not like other tint company ..
I have no idea ... they refuse to answer their phones or even return calls and / or emails .
With that being said , i am going to say probably not .
Just want to say thanks for helping me make the right decision to not use you in my home search !!!
And the number actually is not completely wrong on zillow because i get a voicemail message stating that i have indeed reached on q property management and to leave a message and someone will call back ...* spoiler alert * no one calls back .
After not reaching anyone by phone , i we nt back to zillow and filled out the " contact property management " section and sent it off .
Still no contact back .
Then ( and this was the last straw ) i went to your website , searched rentals , found the home , and attempted to contact you through your own website by clicking " contact agent " ... again ... no response .
Granted , it 's been around for some time , but that does not necessarily indicate it 's great .
I knocked one star off because the quality of eh tofu was not great .
There is not a specific place for online order pickup .
I asked the " cashier " about my order and she said it was not ready .
This time the worker simply dismissed me since she had not called out any orders .
I could not have been more wrong !
She gave helpful information but was not pushy or focused on selling products like i have experienced with last facials .
I will never come to this place again .
It was a bit smaller but not bad .
No " how are you doing this evening " .
Steak neptune - no seasoning on the steak .
Hollandaise was bland and clumpy and clearly placed under a broiler because the top of my food was brown not the colour of the hollandaise .
No flavour - only highlight of this dish was the amount of crab meat shrimp cocktail - overpriced - yes they are large but 5 - 6 years ago they were much bigger for around the same price .
Caesar salad - way too much cheese - they do not make them like they used to .
Yes it 's nice that they make it at the table , but that does not make it taste better - big disappointment for me overall .
This place is certainly not up to par with some of the other great steakhouses ( barberian 's , hy 's , morton 's etc. ) they need an update out of the 80's for decor and with the amount of lights all over the place a bit brighter especially at lunch would help .
Not sure if i would go back or recommend to any family / friends anymore .
There were no unusual delays .
His response , " i do not know . "
And , surprise , there were no traffic delays , none at all , in either direction on the roads ; no construction and no accidents .
I really do not appreciate a hotel staff that lies , specifically , the front desk and rodrigo .
Because of my work schedule and their delivery schedule i would not be able to get the fridge delivered until the following weekend .
When you have seven cases of wine showing up on monday , you do not want to wait until the next saturday !
Let me start by saying it takes a lot to make me want to write a negative review as i understand no business is perfect .
If you call to get a quote , they will quote you a very fair price , but not let you know the price they are quoting is for the poorest of poor quality and even when you ask on the phone if this a low level tint film and if there are any hidden fees , they will not tell you the truth .
Not to mention they will tell you that the initial quoted price will not be guaranteed , will not last and is of very poor quality .
I do not expect it daily on a 10 day stay , but the could check to see what one needs .
I would not recommend this to anyone .
If you have never been to a place like this , you can choose the regular dining area or the hibachi area where they cook in front of you .
I could not understand her at first though .
No complaints whatsoever with the staff .
Though when we did leave , the ladies at the front watched us walk out and did not say goodbye or thank you .
Food : ok , i am part filipino so i do not mind all the flavors used .
I did not like the flavor of the fried rice .
My daughter has never been to a restaurant like this and she loved it .
Though i do like the places in california better , this was not bad for madison .
It also was not ventilated enough inside but it was not unbearable .
I would not mind coming again and trying something new .
I should note i have purchased previous appliances , a water softener and water heater from spencer 's and they have never let me down .
That was about 2 - 3 years ago and we have not been back .
Today , my wife and i decided to use a coupon we got from one of those school coupon books and i can say that we were not real thrilled to go .
You will not be sorry !!!!!!!!
Acarei rude employee at denny 's i called dennys at 3:07 this morning and acarei took my order , 3 moons over my hammy , egg whites , turkey instead of ham , no cheese on one , add avocado and mushrooms to all sandwiches , hashbrowns for all and 2 orders of fruit .
She asked if i 'd been to this dennys before because they do not have mushrooms at this dennys , i said yes you do , i always order from this location with joe and ruby i am a regular here .
She states she 's been working here for 7 months and does not think they have mushrooms , then she states she can not find the mushroom add on button .
I always double check my food , there was no egg whites on any of the sandwiches , and no avocado !
I worked all day and just finished moving , i do not need attitude from anyone who 's helping prepare my food .
This person had no idea how to do a cash refund ( give the money back duh ) she had to call and wake the manager up ( there was no manager or supervisor there on duty ) from his sleep and he had to walk her through step by step on how to do a refund !
Will never go back to this dennys again !!
Did not want to give any stars but could not post review without giving at least 1 star .
They have this huge 16 inch burrito ( no joke ) super reasonably priced and to mirror the review before me , the food is outstandingly fresh .
For the second time , i went to idolize dilworth for a facial with jane and can not wait to go again !
We arrive and we are not acknowledged and finally when we were hostess asks are you waiting to be seating ?
My husband politely says yes and i say i am not standing here for nothing .
U mm sorry not booths but we have a middle table .
Me : no we will wait .
Sadly her and parents had manners as not even her parents told her to move out the way .
She says no and starts to walk away i say can i place an order of toast / white .
At that point i tell my husband $ 5 bucks that toast will not come with my meal .
No toast .
Never a complaint from me on their food .
You lady who does not do the register should at least be professional and let customers know waiting to pay that someone will be with them shorty
I really have no complaints about any of them .
A burger does not need a zillion things on it to be good , it just needs good ingredients , and i feel like that 's what the pub has .
My pedicure was only 15 minutes long i was charged $ 30 the a / c was clearly not to a comfortable setting and the chairs were gross , old and dirty .
I will never return to this place again nor would i recommend this place to anyone .
This is a chain restaurant - my food was not very good , the blue crab sushi was very bready and the pad thai smelled off , like the sauce was something premade full of chemicals .
I am never going back
Great place for families , not crowded , quite , clean and nice .
I know how good they are because before them i had a management company who would never give me my rental income .
Twice my renters moved out and they never let me know .
I had no idea who was in my house .
I do not love this place as much as others , it is your standard issue mall hibachi grill located outside a mall in a family friendly environment .
The chicken was not dry or anything but it was not enough to be my favorite meal .
The non-sushi items in the buffet do not taste good : the sweet and sour chicken is drenched in sour sauce ( the same sauce used to drench the spring rolls ) and dumplings are bland .
If smaller tips are not indicative to staff of a needed change in customer service standards , then it s no wonder the buffet has yet to improve over the months .
The all - you can eat dinner deal is over $ 20 , and is not really that much of a deal .
I will not be back .
I normally do not write these kind of reviews but our server we had here was great .
I am not expecting five star pancakes but they were pretty good .
Their prices are good , in - store service is so so .. first time their installer never made a air gap for my dishwasher .
No call .
I called the store and the sales idiot never submitted the delivery yesterday .
Why is it we just can not get something done right the first time these days .
It 's decent , but not great .
Both the food and salsa are a little bit on the light side , so i suppose they are perfect for those who like mexican - like food but not the full flavors of real mexican food .
I would not choose it on purpose .
Will never return !
It was hard to get a server 's attention because she does not look at you even when you stare at her to get her to take your order .
I would not choose congees with bean curds in them though , because bean curds are soft ; i want some crispiness or some flavour in my congee .
After taking one bite , we did not want to eat it .
I felt so bad wasting that huge dish but we did not even have it packed to go .
I am sure people enjoy that dish but it just was not for us .
Similar to other lower quality ayce places , this sushi place will not provide quality .
I would definitely not visit again and do not recommend wasting $ 20.99 on a weekday for dinner .
And last but certainly not least the salmon teriyaki that was suppose to be belly was a fin plus lil bit of meat left on it
I will never go to another place again !
Good for walk - in , last minute beauty fix if you are not in a hurry .
Granted i probably would not make a big deal with the person threading my eyebrows while she 's doing it , but hey , to each it s own .
They were not skimpy and more than once did someone offer me a re-fill .
Been here twice now , the first time i got a green tea blend and i was not really a fan of it .
After that horrid trip with no a /c in a 120 °
The service is quick and the sashimi is fresh no matter what time of day i order .
No kidding .
No appointment , no call ahead , & josè help a lot explaining everything , and tint was done in couple hrs !
He gave us exceptional customer service and went above and beyond to help us out in getting our appliance needs taking care of , along with somethings he really did not have to do but did for us .
I am not from charlotte but have my bachelorette party this weekend and am here on business .
It 's not over the top sweet and you get a medley of fruit / tapioca / jelly in coconut milk .
It was not a show , like i expected , but more so a guy cooking my food in front of me .
There was no egg in the hat trick , no flaming onion tower , and no fancy knife skills .
I do not understand ... they did not pair with the food at all .
They put their weird ginger sauce in the fried rice , and it was pretty good in that , even though it did not marry well with anything else .
The other tables had fun , and their chefs were acting like expected by flipping dishes and food every which way , so it 's likely we just got someone who was not having a good day - who knows , but judging by the other reviews , i would just go downtown and get some better food with some better service for a better price .
Apparently online reservation does not get any priority in room reservation but instead , they prioritized those ones that walks in to their hotel first .
I visited it later and it was not too busy .
Was not a fan of the fries but the burger was ok .
Burritos well put together , not greasy and great after a long day at wet n wild .
Not only did we hear others in adjoining rooms but there was a mechanical noise in our bathroom that could not be stopped .
Not a ghastly stay by any means , but we have visited many better hamptons .
By the way , there are no restaurants or anything else nearby , so you will need your car or a taxi to get a meal .
I have no idea why there are any bad reviews ?
One review speaks of ' an old lady and daughter ' and there is not that at beverly nails , so maybe some of the bad reviews are about another beverly nails .
There may be other great salons but i found beverly nails , liked it and found no reason to look elsewhere .
Even though it 's an airport hotel , i did not hear any planes landing / taking off .
I was a little worried about staying here , i booked it through expedia and it was at a affordable price .. so i am like why not .. i loved this place ... checking in was fast and easy .. got a room on the second floor .. got a small suite .. it included one bed and a small kitchen .. ( bed was very comfortable ) .. it was clean .. no noise !!
She will give you the perfect most natural look no matter what .
The portion was kind of lacking and wow factor was not there .
After moving from ct i had the worst time finding someone who could understand what i wanted i spent hundreds of dollars to get exactly what i did not want until i found cam !!!
You can not really go wrong .
I have no qualms with eating here .
I learned that i really only need to have a few tools and products to have quick and easy great hair day every day ... my problem was i had all the wrong ones and was fighting my hair every day to no avail .
I was also able to swap out the noodles for rice at no additional charge .
If not purchasing bottled water they sell presweetened beverages from a machine made with cane sugar .
Without the yogurt it had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overfilling .
You can opt for maple syrup instead of honey if that is not your bag .
Every menu item is priced differently so you will not know until you see it on the tablet how much you are spending .
It is not too big but definitely worthwhile .
I never had my brows looking this good .
The wings are the tiniest chicken wings i ever had , with absolutely no sauce , and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars .
No napkins on the table ( all of the bins were not refilled , on any table ) and the upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead of helping us ...
Did not venture into the hibachi area , so can not speak to that .
We were seated right by the waiting area , which was a bit disappointing - it was not super busy but it was rather noisy and distracting .
Had the fried rice for an extra dollar - was not impressed .
We arrived pretty late - i called in earlier letting them know and it was no problem .
Apparently , they did not have her belongings and they made a mistake with their earlier phone call .
We arrived at the hotel and no one knew what we were talking about - there was a lack of communication on their end and we were extremely frustrated because of it .
In the end , they did not have my friends belongings - they said they checked security cameras and also always check housekeepers purses before they leave .
My friend arrived in the clothes she forgot to the hotel and they were not with any of us or in our rental car - they only place they could have been was in the hotel .
My friend should not have forgotten her clothes , but mistakes happen .
What should not happen is people stealing those belongings .
But keep an eye out and do not forget your things here .
I was not feeling like beef so wanted to try something new .
We ordered desserts and they were very frozen and probably something that is not made in house .
I am happy i experienced it however will probably not be back .
I give them 4 stars because it is not the cleanest restaurant , and also they automatically charge you for a large every time unless you specifically ask for a regular .
If you have not been here before it is absolutely worth a try !
Not their fault , but i was not happy at the thought of going another week without our tv .
I asked to have a brand new tv since i did not want to go without for another week .
I never normally stay at hampton in n's , but overall , very happy with my stay .
I wish it was within walking distance of more restaurants as it does not have a restaurant otherwise ( that said , they have delivery to several restaurants in the area ) .
I wish the prices were not so high though .
I assume you are an owner because any employee that always seems so dour , would not be allowed to interact with customers .
For about $ 50 , we could eat at a " real " restaurant so wok box does not often make the cut for being a regular stop .
If i ever come back to this denny 's again , i hope joe will not be there and has moved on to bigger and better things ; he deserves more .
I have been coming to ila at idolize for a few years now and i have never been disappointed !
I did not have to spend a great deal of time explaining what i needed done - andrea quickly understood what i wanted .
I can not stand to spend hours waiting to have my hair done , so the short amount of time it took was a total treat for me .
The only reason that i did not give the salon five stars is because of the price .
I had no idea that it 's been here since may 2016 !!
It 's not as soft as regular boba , but has more of a springy and spongey consistency .
I had an event to attend to yesterday and i can not tell you how many compliments i received for my hair !
I would say the space is not that big but there is seating available .
Compared to the pictures , i thought the salad did not look or taste as appetizing haha .
Just felt like something i could have made at home and the ingredients did not seem too fresh ...
As for the stir fry , you can definitely taste the coconut , which i am not a big fan of so it was just okay for me .
I am not sure if i ordered the wrong thing ...?
It was not bad but the decor is very drab , old school , and stuffy .
Some people perhaps enjoy that but if you are looking for a high end steak / meal with a fun and lively atmosphere , this is def not the place .
They do not even have a bar you can sit at to eat / drink if you are dining by yourself .
My food was not bad but it certainly does not fall anywhere near my top steakhouse list ... a list i have to say i take very seriously .
They advertise walk - ins but i have never been able to walk - in .
I ve been completely ignored to this last time they said i 'd have to wait and i said no problem , how long ?
My pedicure was only 15 minutes long i was charged $ 30 the a / c was clearly not to a comfortable setting and the chairs were gross , old and dirty .
I will never return to this place again nor would i recommend this place to anyone .
First time , so did not know if they brought your food to you if you are upstairs ( they do ! ) plus you can order up there with the bartender and they will call it down .
He not only handled my food but contaminated the food in the containers by just reaching in .
I did not say anything while still there because i was the only customer at the time .
I called today to speak with the manager , he apologized but then made some comments which led me to think he did not believe me .
I will never step foot back in this place !
No pressure .
I never got his name , but he was a very old man .
( mean looks ) . it is definately not a comfortable place to eat .
Can not say enough positive things .
No soothing aloe or attempt to fix my eyebrows when finished .
Check in is not until 4 pm , but they guaranteed a spot by 1 pm if we early check in .
Not only did we have to wait till 4 pm , but they kept telling us in 30 min , in a hour oh not much longer .
It took them 3 hours not to clean the room , but to inspect it ??
I had a late flight and asked to stay in a little later ( checkout is 10 am ! ) which i figured should not be an issue since check in is not till 4 pm .
They called me back an hour later to tell me management said i can not do either .
No hassles about being a no show , or having to pay a cancellation penalty .
This is by far the " worst oysters " i have ever had :/ tasteless & watery not with natural juice per se :/ like some one took the oyster liquor off and pored salty water in the shells and small oysters ( 6 ) for 20 $ prob piss water wld have been a step up for christ sake !
Def not a todd english restaurant any longer - caveat emptor !
The clerks were not friendly or helpful .
We were told we could check in early but they would not let us check in until 4 despite being there for 4 hours previously .
I would not stay again .
Actually had to update my review seeing as my pedicure paint job lasted with shine and no chip longer than i have ever experienced .
I do not just trust any person with scissors .
He has not tried to cut it short ( seriously - every stylist seems to want to chop it all off ) , he works with my curls and he understands that i also love my hair straightened .
Not pretentious .
A lot of fun ( which getting my haircut is normally a painful experience - not a fun one ) the only negative ?
Not terrible for a classy restaurant .
I have had my days where i was rude and ryon did not deserve it .
The items i have tried so far taste exactly the same as the other location , so no complaints there .
My only complaint for eating in is that they have huge air vents that were blowing out cold air over almost every table so it could not be avoided either .
This place will not disappoint , try their food today !
More private than getting threaded at the mall and no appointment needed .
Customer service is not a priority for on the q.
I contacted them daily and did not receive a response until today which was via text .
The house is no longer available and time was wasted attempting to contact this business .
Been here twice now , the first time i got a green tea blend and i was not really a fan of it .
I eat here once in a while ... not my decor but it s really pretty good food .
She told me go get specifically the extensions that would be able to be colored just in case the color did not match and that she would be able to do everything i mentioned .
I show up a week later with my $ 150 extensions , she colors my hair , proceeds to start styling and says she will not have time to do the extensions .
Not only that , but tells me this after she opened the box and took them out ( making them non returnable ) .
She tried to curl my hair but i do not even know what you would call it ...
I will not be going back here ...
You do not need an appointment for threading .
I have always walked in , even during busy times after work , and i have never waited more than 5 minutes .
I was with my prior stylist for about 15 years and i just was not happy with my hair or her advice on how to fix it , so i finally found another stylist closer to work in uptown charlotte .
My new stylist did a better job , but i still did not love my hair .
I searched angie 's list , yelp , etc for reviews and finally found shine salon and , most importantly , james . james was the first stylist who truly and carefully listened to what i liked and did not like a out my hair and asked thoughtful questions about what would / would not scare me before he put his brilliant and creative mind to work on my hair .
I have since made an appt for my daughter - n- law to see him in a few weeks - i can not wait to see his creative transformation on her hair .
Oh and i can not forget about the best vietnamese coffee they have !!
Came here because the reviews seemed promising and was not let down .
I had a scheduled manicure appt that lasted 30 minutes ( was extremely rushed ) the soaking dish containing water was cold she was put out by having to answer any of my nail questions she berated me when one of my polished nails touched the towel and had to be touched up and when i initially called to make the appt and asked if there was any extra charge for having my current gel polish removed ( i just wanted a regular manicure at this appt ) they said no as long as we do a manicure for you at this appt they did charge me $ 5.00 for removing the gel polish so a $ 12 manicure cost me $ 17 . my mom also had an appt same day later time and was treated much the same and her acrylic nails looked horrible !
Never will i go back and i will be sure to always let others know of the customer service and quality ( lack there of ) of work they do .
Decent place , was not thrilled with the manicure .
Not sure if i will be back .
Room is nice , it has everything you want , just need a good customer service , we only stayed one night , but i felt like they only wants us to stay for 12 hours , they check us in late because room is not ready , and called at 10 asking if we are checking out , kind of feel like they are kicking us out for overstaying , probably not going back unless they have a good sale .... pricey too ..
I am glad i did not base going on some of the reviews i read .
He talked to them like people and did not ignore them .
This place is not the same since they changed hands .
The only reason it is not one star is because the gal who gave me a pedicure was very nice .
Never did get my nails done .
Never thought i would see a well designed che ba mau cup , can not beat the location
I was sat in a chair where the massage did not even work .
Is not the massage part of the cost of the pedi ?
They got started on her pedi . for whatever reason my daughter did not want the softening of her feet done ... like the scrubbing , so asked her to stop .
I then hear my daughter say , " oh , no that toe is white with black stripes . "
The lady literally yelled at her saying , " why did nt you tell me before i painted it pink ?!?! " well sorry she was not staring at you the entire time .
Do not yell at her , she is a child ! "
Which i did not know until my daughter told me after or we really would have had a problem .
I was like ... no these need to be redone .
Should not we just be charged for a nail paint ?
Well then she should have gotten the massage and everything else included with the full price of a pedi , which she did not get .
No , it did not fix anything and we will never be back .
Please do not go to this shop and i wish i had read reviews before we chose to come .
I selected the red curry tofu noodle bowl - it was slightly disappointing as it was not packed with as much flavor as i imagined it to be and the portion was not as large as i feel it should be for $ 10 .
I was not 100 % sure of the che but i ordered the fruit addict and it was weird for me because i have never had anything like it before and there was a lot of stuff and jellies in there but it tasted good .
We were not sure if it was the smell of the business or if the place used to be a salon , but we kept tasting something funny .. can not quite put my finger on it .
We were not sure if it was the smell of the business or if the place used to be a salon , but we kept tasting something funny .. can not quite put my finger on it .
It 's not our first visit - but for sure the most disappointed one .
We did not got chopsticks .
We did not got small plats do we can eat somehow .
We did not got small containers for soy sauce .
We did not get drink refill by mistake - they charge my amex with over $ 130 .... they fix the mistakewithout telling me !!!
His sauce was sesame garlic sauce which was on the bland side and the roasted tofu tasted like it was not really roasted but had a dab of smoke on it .
Disappointing we heard from honeygrow , they did not apologize for our poor experience only said that 's not what they are well known for .
Also , the email address they gave me to respond to their comment was not valid .
... not the best i tasted , but surely works if you crave for sushi , and that s the only place nearby , you can go to kill the sushi craving .
A little on the thicker side and was not expecting that , but i do like the fact that you can choose two topping add - one for free .
Once it had filled in i thought i did not need to point out how to do my brow anymore since i had seen her pretty regularly and had told her to leave it each time .
I guess it was my mistake for not saying something but thought after all this time that she would know .
I would rather pay someone more who is experienced with shaping brows and not just threading and pulling willy nilly without looking at the shape and trying to match the brows .
Larry stated that the 500 model sells for several hundred dollars more . no apology or refund was offered and no reasonable solution to their mistake was given .
The lady working on my nails was rude and did not seem to have the skills to successfully complete a basic manicure .
I will never go back .
Nevertheless the wait time was not anything crazy .
The only drawback might have been the noise level , but there 's not much you can do about that with a full restaurant on a very busy day .
It 's not too sweet , just perfect .
It seem like she did not give me the 20 % discount or it was not a thing .
She did not smile at all but her tone of voice did not sound she was filled with hatred .
Going back to the yelp offer , she only gave me the discount for two drinks but clearly it said the whole order and that did not happen .
It 's fine , but my offer did not say maximum two drinks .
I would take off another star but i am not .
I have some curly & big hair and this southern weather does not make anything easier when it comes to a style or cut .
Attempting to be more of a grown up , i figured i should refrain from getting my hair cut at super cuts ( not trying to hate on super cuts ) .
Even though i do not get my hair cut every six weeks , i did not feel judged for my clearly horrible split ends !
I left with a new style and smile - could not have been happier !
I was trying to get information on the shuttle and she was not even trying to help and answer my questions .
I did not pay to get treated disrespectfully .
I have worked customer service my whole life and i have never spoke to a single customer the way she spoke to me .
I have never had threading before and i wanted to give it a try .
I was in and out in no time .
I finally have a nice arch and i do not have to fill them in everyday if i do not want to .
The food did not take very long to come out so that was cool .
I got stuffed for under $ 10 and that does not happen very often .
Brought my daughter who is not even one yet and they were very baby friendly and accommodating .
Never seen that before !
Never used the shuttle system , but that looked handy dandy too !
Ok , so all i have to say is i never even hear the airport !
No brainer there !
One thing i hate is rooms that smell old and musty or when you check - in after a long day of travel and something does not work .
I have never encountered any of that here ... ever. the manager , pamela , even greeted me and asked me to enjoy my stay .
I needed a new refrigerator because the house did not come with one .
No meat in our beef taco , cheese in the enchilada was not even melted !
My advice never go there .
The shuttle will not let you take luggage or drinks with you , so you can not use it to get to the hotel to check in ( or out when you are leaving ) , and let 's face this is vegas and everyone always has a drink in their hand .
And there 's no restaurant or bar on the property , so you can not order food or drinks by the pool .
Amazing and fantastic service by the installations crew - i could not have found anything better .
Thank you to jake airey of the installation team for his excellent communication , knowledge , customer service ( did not make me feel like a deer in the headlights ) and ability .
His honesty and credibility ( knowledge ) came to light when he advised me i did not need a piece of equipment originally thought ; he was able to complete the task without it .
They were not happy unless i was happy ; those are not just words but a motto they lived by .
Do not know what happened but no longer todd english pub but the pub .
Indifferent bartenders , pleasant , but that does not make for an enjoyable experience .
I am new to charlotte so i have not found my go to brow spot .
The service was quick and the lady was nice but she did not arch my eyebrows the way i liked it , however she kept them thick which i appreciated .
I probably will not be back .
Although our room appears okay i can not give any more because of the pictures from other guests rooms .
Had i seen the yelp reviews i would not have chosen this hotel but the stay was not horrible and given our positive experience with the staff they might change your room if it s infested .
Terrible service and for what you get , not even worth the price .
Not a good morning for ricardo and the cook .
This place also can not stop raising prices .
Also , you can not beat the price .
We ended up not getting into the rooms till the check in at 4:00 p... which okay ..
However , one of our rooms bathtubs jets did not work , had a lot of mold inside the jet areas and surrounding the rings to them .
The pool maintenance gentleman said he was cleaning the pools and left ( never seen him after that ... we were in the hot tub for a long time ) .
We requested a late checkout and was told yes by the lady at the front desk and when i called and confirmed later that night ( agreeing to pay extra ) i was denied and told i would be charge full price and tax if we were not out by 10:00 a
The towels were not completely washed because when i unfolded one of them it had really sketchy streaks on it ..
I would give it 1 star had it not been for the excellent customer service and nice atmosphere .
Not authentic asian .
It seemed there was no sauce .
The meat was about the same quality you would expect from taco bell and the veggies certainly were not fresh .
I went with my husband couple weeks ago , and we both did not enjoy what we got .
I got the oolong milk tea , which i think did not taste like oolong at all and overly sweet eventhough i have already requested for less sweet .
My husband got no 1 , the bambu special .
Best burger i have had in awhile definitely not a regular drive through !
Ricardo 's does have a salsa bar , but it 's definitely not a highlight , imo .
I did not know anything about tints or types before coming in .
Can not go wrong with the johnny utah with pickles , pulled pork , and mac and cheese in a taco .
This place is no different .
I know chinese places often do not have the best decor ( by western standards anyways ) .
The food is not consistent during dinner .
I would not get any salads since they use pre washed greens and taste dry and dirty like they need to be washed .
If you have kids avoid the pizza it 's never cooked properly .
Remember you do not go to places like denny 's expecting fine dining .
I must say i 'd rather go to panda express than eat here and i do not go to panda express anymore .
They were fast , friendly , and they only use film that 's legit and will not fade .
It was sooooooo spicy i could not even palate it .
I did not know anything could be that spicy !
Not there for helping , cleaning tables , or anything else .
There are also very few tables at this location and they are placed so close together that inconsiderate families gave no thought to taking up 3 tables .
There were not anywhere near enough for the number of people there .
I will also throw a huge " piss off " out there to hampton inn for not serving biscuits and gravy anymore ... my favorite reason for going there in the first place , but the other reasons still stand , so i will remain loyal .
- putting green is fun for kids .. it 's small , and has no challenging breaks .
Not serious golfer quality .
- no restaurant .
- no casino .
- rooms are limited , so requests are not often fulfilled .
Tahiti does not feel like las vegas .
So the white polish for a extra $ 10.00 was not needed .
Which was not a design it 's a french tip .
Will not be back .
This place is a copy of viva chicken , but yet , not viva chicken .
I do not understand why she even works there .
She should not .
The food was not my favorite .
The corn was not what i expected .
It was like corn soufflé only not sweet and basically flavorless .
Overall ... not thrilled , no desire to venture back .
I would not recommend nor go out of my way .
Woman did not even turn around to hand me take out food and continued to talk to colleagues .
They do not skimp on the ingredients either .
I did not like at all my experience there , the service was really shitty , the waitresses looked like they ran out of fucks to give , after ordering my order took a reeeeeally long time to come and when it came the rice in the sushi was warm !
After sitting down the atmosphere was so not welcoming i wanted to go away immediately but i stayed and even than , after the order came i could only think about eating the faster i could so i can go away tbh besides the ward rice the food was not that bad but the atmosphere was so heavy i would not want to go back
While i personally did not try any of the local honey and granola options , she did .
I have heard about this place with mixed reviews for years now , and we had a client coming from out of town and why not go to give it a try .
The steak are priced high but very good , the ribs that i had were under average , not off the bone , not juicy or saucy ...
Disappointing all in all we had a unlucky night with a high bill so it 's not possible to give a high rating hopefully you do not get unlucky when you go !!!!!
This is your typical ayce sushi joint and you do get what you pay for but considering the area and the quality of food ( for ayce ) , we have never been disappointed .
We simply can not get enough .
We have been here many times and never once have they ever charged us the automatic 15 % gratuity .
People do know that they need not pay that 15 % if they disagree ?
It 's not law .
So we did not even get a show .
The waiter never came to check to see if we needed more to drink .
The vegetables were ok , the steak had no flavor .
I never criticize but this place was just not worth the money .
Do not waste your money .
Prompt , fast , not a lot of little talk .
They did a few dishes well , and a few were edible but not good .
Service is not note - worthy as you can expect from any chinese owned place .
There are better places but i will not mind coming here again if i am in the area and want to stuff myself .
Not only did they not show up at the time frame they provided , but they did not bother to call and let me know they were running hours late .
The sales man who assisted me , alan said sorry they are a third party company and there 's nothing i can do ... ask for manager and they said he was not available until the next week .. after giving them 2 additional hours to show up no one ever did .
The sales man who assisted me , alan said sorry they are a third party company and there 's nothing i can do ... ask for manager and they said he was not available until the next week .. after giving them 2 additional hours to show up no one ever did .
I called to get a refund and requested a confirmation but was told they would not do my refund until tomorrow when they had the washer and dryer in their possession .. are you kidding .
Do not buy from here .
Poor service , their low prices do not make up for the horrible service .
No biggies however i have 20 bucks .
However did not come check on me one time .
And did not even say thank you .
Food was fine but it 's the principle of not checking on me and not thanking me .
First time i got the sesame garlic stir fry - not spicy , but delicious - lots of fresh veg and meat .
Just be careful if you are not into spicy .
Other than the speed at which the food came out at , it is not good .
Shrimp tempura in dynamite roll did not taste fresh and the rolls are very small .
We shooed it away then it would not leave .
Will never return .
If you want saucy wings ask for extra sauce but if you get the buffalo you probably will not need it because the flavoring is amazing .
Will definitely be back to try more of the menu , it 's small but i prefer small menus as to not over whelm me .
So if you are in thorn hill give this place a try ... you will not regret it .
Also the girl could not explain to my friend what boba is .
It 's definitely not top of the line but it 's nice enough .
I am not really into manicures anyways .
One thing i do like about this place is you can just walk in and not have to make an appointment .
They were questioning why they were told they could not reserve when others were able to reserve seats .
The food is always good so there are no complaints there .
It was not horrible .
The girl seemed like she could not be bothered and wanted to be else were .
I was not impressed by his conversations .
Great , no non-sense property management team .
No doubt , the interior is nice .
I was not a fan of their honey ginger vinaigrette ?
Not too impressed .
The servers were really nice but not too attentive .
Was not the best visit .
Did not clean the room regularly .
No tv ; no wifi ; and thank god .
No dress code enforced .
Unkept people in old dirty jeans does not enhance the experience .
Just went there for the first time yesterday and will never be going back .
My mani was not good , i felt both ladies were rushed , the paint was not spread even and there are air bubbles on a couple of the nails .
I would not recommend this place , madison had other much better options .
I had the 3 roll lunch special and was not disappointed .
Was not a fan of the medallion fries or baked potato - both were very bland .
Spencer 's does not back up the appliances they sell with a dependable company , which is centurian .
Been going here for a couple of years and had many things on the menu and never disappointed .
I have never had a bad drink on the menu and the team in there is super cool .
They would not even care to inform me when my property manager left the company and when the tenant moved out they sent their handyman company to give an estimate for the necessary repairs .
It was also a mix up of repairs for which the tenant was responsible and other services not related to damages caused by the tenant .
I did not use their handyman company to mitigate the damages and at that point on q refused to communicate with me .
No response to emails or faxes .
( of course , that never happened .... ) .
Until now , ( several month 's after the tenant moved out ) i never received a statement showing what they did with the tenant 's deposit .
It was not just me , all four of us were actually sweating .
I was insulted by the price of the caesar salad , so i did not order it .
And believe me , i knew the prices were high before i went there and i honestly did not care b/c i assumed the food was good .
No soup of salad .
So i been wanting to try this place for some time i went there today and to be honest i am on the fence about coming back i ordered the stuff avocado and street corn casserole the food was pretty tasty a lil bland for me but tasty my issue with this place was the lack luster customer service and the fact that i had a 40 min wait for something i ordered to go i was very annoyed but here 's the kicker i ordered a drink when i went to refill it before i left there was mosquito in my cup not sure how it got there or when but i noticed it half way through my drink i ask for the manager one of the team members takes my drink to the manager and i honestly did not feel any since of urgency or remorse all i got was a new cup and a $ 5 off my next trip no refund no free dessert no apology nobody stopped to check the ice machine or anything that did not sit well with me
No extra cost to get parking for extra cars .
Of the things i did not like thought were the fold out couches .
So uncomfortable and hurt my back , did not sleep well .
I do have to say i have not been to many ayces in toronto , but compared to what i am used to i thought it was quite solid and reasonable for the price .
I have been coming here for almost 2 years and will never have another place do my nails !
I feel i vastly overpaid , far more than i expected to , and i am not at all happy with the cut .
There was no massage with the shampoo .
Will not return .
Perhaps if you have been doing your own hair at home it seems okay , but if you are used to internationally trained stylists who keep up their training , this is not the place .
If you have not tried it , it 's in the new trend of fast , " locally sourced " real food , like chipotle , choolaah indian bbq or piada in oakland .
I am sure they would not like to be grouped together , but to me they are basically all the same ; quicker versions of " ethic " food .
( i did not like it so i ended up asking for a side of the sesame garlic . )
And as i said , i did not really like the tahini sauce , but i got it on the side , so it was not a problem .
He did not realize you could choose lite , heavy , etc. sauce , and the amount they used was a little too much for him , but he liked it otherwise .
We will be back but it is not like i am dreaming of the place .
If you want real chinese / thai / asian cuisine , this is not it , but if you are looking for a decent , quick , semi- healthy grab - n - go meal , it 's a great option .
It also was not very sanitary from what i could tell .
They do not use a new sterile set of tools so who knows if they have even been disinfected .
Will not be returning .
I notify rebeccah that i have not received the key in the mail .
The inspector never shows .
I have a job , so i can not make it .
But the key to my personal storage unit does not .
August 22 : i email rebeccah telling her that i am getting worried and do not want to call a locksmith or my attorney .
No word from rebeccah or on q. also , they stacked the dryer on top of the washer without properly securing it and did not respond to multiple requests to fix it .
I am 5 ' 3 '' , 110 lbs and do not want to go out in my closet via death by dryer .
He was not pushy and gave the space and time needed to make a decision about our purchase .
For the past two years ... for what reason .. i m not sure .
I had not gone to shine .
So , last week i set up a consultation to talk about cut and color .. i wanted to talk about doing highlights ( i have never done anything like that to my hair ) .
Can not wait .
I had not been itching to try this place because we have already got roco and viva chicken rocking the rotisserie close by .
Oh , and they have $ 3 drafts on fridays which does not hurt !
20 minutes later still no menus .
Even though they do not close till 9:00 pm he locked the door after we left .
I have only been there on other time it was not that great .
Not sure i will be back especially if service is that bad .
I do not recommend this place .
I will not be coming back anytime soon , used to come frequently .
It is not elegant but it is a very relaxing place to vacation .
No waiting for valet , centrally located by a grocery store , pharmacy and access to the freeway to get to casinos within 10 minutes .
Although the service was ok we were served the dinner menu without being told so and when this was brought to the attention of the waitress at the end of the meal , she informed us that last call was at 2:30 pm ... not sure how we are supposed to guess .
I have not been here in a long time and the last time i was here was at least 1.5 years ago before i joined the yelp community .
The biggest negatives to this place is that they do not offer dessert , or shrimp tempura and their kitchen items are a bit below average .
Not worth a special drive , but if you are in the area , it 's good for a quick ayce sushi lunch .
Not very busy but the waiter was very attentive to our needs .
Stayed here recently , but lived here mon- fri a couple of years ago , so have a lot of experience with this hotel and i am never disappointed .
There have never been any issues with the cleanliness .
I did not have a car on this trip , and they have a couple of pretty good restaurants close by .
I was not impressed and would never return .
It could be custom made , so kids selected their sauces and no spices :) we will go again and again
The downside it 's close to the airport and you hear the planes land and take off , but not too much late at night .
Good company so far no issues .
Repairman came to fix the ceiling and management company had not informed him that he needed containment to accomplish the repairs properly .
We did not have a choice in the pool company because it was included in the rent .
We even offered to have the rent lowered and then we would pay for a new maintenance company so we would not have these issues .
We felt this was extremely unfair because we did not have the choice of pool company .
The inspector told me that i did not need to be there and that he was only there to take pictures to give back to the property manager so they can make a determination .
We received a letter back saying that they refunded us for one light bulb , but consider the cleaning charges final , which did not include the photos we requested .
If somebody does not contact us back to refund our money immediately , we will be taking it to small claims court and will also be suing for the utilities we incurred that we had no control over due to the pool issues .
I have never had a bad experience and would recommend them to anyone !
It 's not painless but it 's just about as painful as waxing your brows but way more sanitary and you do not tub the risk of getting burned .
They have a different culture which takes a little getting used to , but they have very good prices , and my nails never lift or break and my toenail polish always lasts until my next pedicare .
She seemed like she was in a hurry but i do not understand why ..
If you could not fit me in then please let me know !
I told her if she can not get me to the level i wanted on the balayage then it s fine .
I told her " this is what i want " she did not ask much questions and she made it seem like she knew exactly what i wanted ...
I had a faded blonde ombre that got brassy and my roots were pretty grown out and i said i do not want to see any of my natural roots .
I do not want to see any black .
She did not touch my brassy old ombre at the ends of my hair .
She did not ask about it .
She did not communicate to me how she was going to achieve my look .
She did not have a clear picture what i wanted .
She did not educate me how the process was going to work out .
I explained to her that this was not what i wanted .
You said you wanted highlights and no dark roots " .
I was not going to walk around with bright blonde highlights , natural roots , and brassy ends !
She left to mix some colors ... and did not even to bother ask me what shade i wanted .
This whole entire experience she did not show me swatches or color scales ..
She said that she did not know that and when i showed her the balayage i wanted she said that she thought " oh no. she 's not going to like that " .
She said that she did not know that and when i showed her the balayage i wanted she said that she thought " oh no. she 's not going to like that " .
If i can not reach to that level today at least put me on the road towards it .
I am so sad .. she did not get a chance to get to know me .
When i explained to her i did not like my hair she did not get an attitude .
It was not worth it .
The next day i called to explain my issue and why i was not satisfied and shine salon said they are always willing to fix an unsatisfied hair job from their own stylists .
But they never did .
There are no refunds .
And it s not worth my time to keep calling them and to complain about my hair .
I found some lettuce that had brown spots and other large bits did not seemed to be washed .
It also had a strange taste but i do not know if it was because of the salad prior .
Like all of the pieces from the chicken you do not want .
I have no complaints about the wait staff because they are always pleasant to me .
Shame about the food quality , i will not be coming back .
My parents also rented a property through them and had a similar bad experience ( aka charging my parents six dollars to replace a lightbulb after move out !! ) now my credit is not stellar i will admit but i found a cute place thru an advertisement on craigslist , posted by a man who said he was showing the condo for the owner .
I had a conversation on the phone with someone named patrick ( owner ? ) while the man that created the cl ad showed me the condo , i stated i was very interested even though it would not be available for 3 + more weeks .
There was some confusion as this particular unit was not listed on their website as being available so i had to apply under another unit number .
My situation changed and i was not able to get & did not want a cosigner for my lease .
I contacted sam asap at on q and stated i am not able to get a cosigner and will continue to look for another rental .
He asked me the reason so he could communicate that with patrick i stated i was not able to get a cosigner etc .
Patrick called me a few hours later & left a voicemail ( bullying ) stating that my $ 300 deposit was " a non-refundable deposit that 's why it 's called a deposit " he stated his disappointment that i was not able to get a cosigner !!
The next day i have to go back - and - forth with sam at on q who told me that i needed to work it out with patrick to get my $ 300 back as they did not even realize that rental is available and they had no receipt of me giving them $ 300 .
I explained to them the money order was made out to on - q property management , patrick is one of their employees so it is their problem to deal with and i would seek legal counsel the next week if they do not refund my money asap !
I have received my $ 300 cashiers check back , the man i had given it to very nice and honestly was not part of this mess .
However i think onq property management is shady and i am so glad my credit was not up to par in this case because i can only imagine what sort of headaches i would have endured with this property management company !!
Not wanting to wait 30 min for a table , we head to aji sai .
I do not love ayce .
I have been to aji sai in barrie and it was sub-par , so i never returned .
No sashimi however they did have butterfish sushi which was fantastic .
Service was ok but not great .
The honey garlic wings had actual honey and garlic shavings , not some fake honey garlic sauce .
If you see the incredibly sweet shree , you will not be disappointed .
I ve been going here for over 2 years and will not go anywhere else !!!
There was no wait so ila took me to her chair right away .
Now do not get me wrong , there are past instances when i have had amazing brows in charlotte and atlanta ( my former home ) but not at the rate of $ 12 !
I have always paid at least $ 25 and up at other brow bars and that does not include the tip .
We were not starving but we were hungry .
Their menu is just the right size , not so long that you can not decide .
Not impressed .
Will not return with better , more reasonably priced options in town .
I never thought that i would be reviewing denny 's but why not .
If you are not looking for the local flavor and you are ok with a chain ... there is no better place to go for a good , inexpensive breakfast .
The grits are not too soupy either .
This place is not a place i would recommend at all ...
The condition of the beds are bad and not comfortable .
Maribel is one of the best waitresses and she always remembers what we drink and eat , even if we have not been here for a while .
You got bathtub jacuzzi 's you have an outstanding hit jacuzzi and sandy beachy pools you got an outdoor grill man - winterman - you have what you want let your mind free from troubles and problems you need those tensions relaxing and gone relax at this beautiful resort a place to be to stay for the greatest best of your enjoyment a place you can release all your stress and let it go freely love it like it do not hate it .
Because satisfaction of this place thumbs up such a great beautiful timeshare my beautiful love of my life dose not even wan na leave after feeling so happy so do what you must feels confident and comfortable @ the tahiti is a wonderful place place blahh of non sense of what others think and say because i have not had any problems ask f peter at the front desk a gentleman who 's smart and elegant knows and feels why we compliments on why we love it and why we wan na even stay longer , !!!!
That way you do not have to worry about them threading too much inside is very clean and nicely suited for the services they provide .
While i have not tried their other services , i can vouch for their skills when it comes to threading brows !
Everything on the menu is beautifully and deliciously crafted , you can not go wrong with whatever you order !
If i did not like them so much , i would probably be annoyed actually lol .
I 'd never had a che before so it 's been a very fun new treat to explore !
Not a fan of the taro lover .
Planes were fairly constant but did not stop me from falling asleep .
We then leave a message for the store manager who never calls us back .
The store manager never comes out to face us .
I was a manager in appliances myself and never treated my customers the way we were treated .
Do not buy there and if you do , expect to receive absolutely no customer service if you have an issue .
Recommendations : apps : escargot , shrimp , caesar salad ( portions are for at least two and they make it right in front of your table - try not to add / subtract anything because you will be surprised at how good it is the way they make it ) mains : filet mignon and salmon dessert : molten lava cake
He did not have gas in stock .
Kept telling me there was no reason to buy gas .
I said no your are trying to talk me out of buying .
Kitchen manager guy was cool but after a 30 minute wait for some chicken and rice .... there was no saving this visit .
After my manicure a week ago i removed my nail polish and to my horror i now have a nail fungus ( which i have never had in my life ) caused by dirty instruments used at beverly nails !!
It was delicious with no complaints and for only $ 6.75 . my husband 's order of pan fried minced beef & golden mushroom rice noodle was a bit late in arriving but it seemed to have been made fresh and then pan fried , thus hence for the delay .
His dish was only $ 6.50 , so the meal came to $ 14.97 ( including $ 1.72 hst ) so one can not complain about that .
I am not super picky about where i get my pedicures .
Evidently , this place is not that memorable as i apparently visited a year before with my mother and did not recall .
This is certainly not a new shop .
I was a little bummed because the chair was a little broken and did not recline / incline so i was stuck in one position .
I was a little grossed out that they did not use a basin liner and encouraged me to put my bare feet on the foot rests ( rather than cover it with a towel first ) once my actual pedicure started the woman barely spoke to me but was very social with her colleagues .
I picked the special pedicure which offered a choice of coffee or white tea mask but she did not give me a choice .
Granted they were busy but 45 dollars is not exactly a " discount " pedicure .
I did not end up with any fungus and other than bleeding a little no major damage was done but i do not think i will be visiting this location in the future .
Try them with chicken you will not regret it .
Then when they found out it was for pick up , they started sitting the dine in customers who came in after me again and again before i had to stop them and said " hey , i do not have all day .
The food is sitting right there behind you . " we will not be coming back to this place .
You would never know it used to be an old country buffet .
I have never had a bad experience with threading here .
However , i had a terrible experience with the lash plus lashes and will never be getting them done here again .
They were not applied very well ( you could see the glue along my lash line ) and half of them fell out within a day .
I was never given after care instructions nor really told how to care for them at all .
The esthetician just told me not to use oil based makeup or face wash .
The esthetician said that she could not get me an appointment until tuesday ( it was saturday ) .
I sent an email to management and was pleased that they responded ; however , the owner , who said that he would be calling me , never did .
We book 7 months in advance for a full kitchen and washer / dryer and did not get that room .
We never heard back we called to ask and kept getting he is busy or out showing .
When we did get him he had no idea what we were talking about and later goes o yea i have not contacted the owner yet .
If i could they would get negative stars never have a dealt with someone so unprofessional .
I was not really sure what i wanted , but we decided to split because the portions seemed huge .
It was quick and easy to place our order and we did not have to wait long .
We ordered it to go , but when it was ready it was not packaged to go .
The kung pao shrimp was not my favorite , but it could have been because that was not what i wanted originally .
I mean do not expect gourmet sushi , ok ?
It s a small place as well so may not be ideal for big groups .
Hosts could use some customer service training but honestly i will keep going back because the servers are great and the food has never disappointed me
But i consistently come back so i guess i should not complain ! :)
Also , do not even try to come during lunch hour or at 5 pm because parking can be hard to find thanks to the harris teeter .
There was a gentleman who was working , not sure if he was waitstaff or what but he was singing and really just making the experience great .
Our hibachi chef was not the most entertaining .
We had another family at our table that was not part of our group who had a younger boy and i thought the chef could have been a bit more interactive with him .
Prices are fair and it 's never too crowded .
Not a best place to have jap food .
It was not even close to good .
Check in , they said no problem whatsoever .
Dude ( or dudette - i do not see race or sex ) , have you ever been to a dennys ?
Not sure there 's much to say except that dennys is at least consistent in their offerings and with their quality of food .
I am from the northwest valley and there are not a lot of places like this on my side of town .
We got a quality kitchen aid product at an excellent price and have absolutely no complaints .
I walked in around lunch time and immediately sat in the chair to get started with no wait at all .
My brows have never looked so good !
Not bad for an ayce sushi joint .
- yakitori ( it was a large piece of dried out chicken deep fried ) - snapper and salmon sashimi ( bland ) - steak teriyaki ( chewy and dry ) - selection of rolls ( almost 90 % of the rolls consisted of tempura bits ) - agedashi tofu ( cold and tasted weird ) - salmon teriyaki ( they only had the neck & belly ) - udon ( not the japanese ones so very hard ) - soy sauce ( worst part of my experience .
Follow him on ig @ markafterdark ( no he did not solicit my review ) .
I have never booked a follow up appointment with a stylist before .
Not to mention the orgasmic smelling products make me creepily sniff my own strands .
Not the best which is ironic considering the restaurant 's name .
I do not even care if they are polite or smile but at least try to help out customers instead of standing around .
They provide a shuttle which goes to the strip ( about 2 miles ) , which i have never used .
I was very disappointed that i left a voicemail and no one called me back .
I can not imagine what would happen if a customer of mine called and i did not bother to acknowledge their phone call .
I have to add that i ended up calling them the next day again to actually get a response but i do not even want to do business with them now .
The waitress even let us substitute our hot fudge for caramel at no extra cost .
Do not expect to be blown away by the food , but expect to meet your inner fat kid 's craving .
They have some unique rolls that i have not seen at other places .
The fish in my tacos was so overcooked i could not even chew it .
They forgot the sauce for my fries and i waited almost a half hour for my take out order , there was no one else there so not sure why the wait .
They do not care if you are there or not .
Never going there again .
I will never go back again .
When i arrived at 10:30 , i did not have to wait at all .
I watched them argue with a 16 year old girl when she said she only had a credit card and could not use an atm .
She said she is going back to school so she probably will not be there much longer .
** great cheap alternative to vegas hotels ( if you are not a gambler ) ** first off , there is no gambling at this vegas establishment .
- the pool is open 24 hours but they do have request quiet time from 10:00 p - 7:00 a. - my only gripe was that the hot water in the shower does not get a hot as i normally like .
This is not a vegas hotel , this is a time share and they will offer you to go on a tour of their new facility .
Additionally , do not expect the typical hot vegas skirts and heels in this place .
Chelsea & i talked through my whole cut so there was not a bit of awkwardness at all , and i completely appreciated that .
I will go back , but will definitely not be able to afford a cut every 4 - 6 weeks !
Only thing is that they do not have dessert on the ayce -- at the south location they have several on theirs .
Not saying it 's the best but i think they have decent food at very fair prices and restaurant is always clean unlike alot of others out there .
The food is decent but i did not think it was good enough to justify the cost .
I am not sure if the broccoli was frozen , but there was water at the bottom .
It was mostly cabbage and peanuts .. no heat pretty much whatsoever .
( what , no pork ? ) .
Weird place , way overpriced , almost like pei wei - i am not sure which one 's worse .
It was busy as it usually is and i never mind waiting for services because i do trust their process and am never dissatisfied .
She does not speak to me the entire time .
Now i have never gone where my wax was not followed up by tweeting and even topical agents to remove wax or even cool down the irritation .
However , she did not do either .
I am so disappointed that my longtime nail salon has disappointed me so much and that i am now forced to not only repay money somewhere to have my eyebrows fixed , but am also forced to find a new place to get my nails done regularly .
The hot verde sauce was very good but it 's not worth going back for .
It 's good when you are in a hurry but not so good if you want a good job done .
Every single time i come here the ladies rush even when it 's not even busy .
My daughter was a little sad after we left and it was not a very good experience .
The pedicures are ok at best , i do not usually get manicures but i have heard other customers complaining while paying that the job is not what they expected .
Today 's visit was my last , i will not return .
I would not recommend to anyone .
I ordered a standard taco with steak , no lettuce , and a build your own burger .... the kahuna , build your own burger , grilled onions only .
Not the case here .
If i go back , i will not be ordering burgers .
I have been to almosto several different stylists there and never had a bad experience !
I have had most of the menu now , but will not be going back anymore .
The ingredients appear great , and taste really good , it 's just unfortunate they do not cook things enough to make them hot .
This place is my favourite place for lobster and every time i order it , i am never disappointed .
Not salty and all and the corn adds a sweetness to the soup that works .
I did not enjoy it as much as the other two dishes .
Have not found better tasting mexican food at this price point .
Myself and my friends frequent this place all the time and it never disappoints .
It was cooked to perfection and no issues cutting through the meat .
This is not your typical hawaiian joint like aloha , rumbi , etc , and as long as you know that going into it , you will not be disappointed .
Can not wait to go back and try something else !
I read some reviews that stated things that we did not encounter at all , with that being said , this is a new restaurant and people should take that into consideration when writing reviews .
Horrible energy she was being rude to me slapping my hand when i would not take my hand out of the gel machine fast enough !
I could not wait to get out of this place !
Never again !
Had the rice box for lunch & it was just ok - the spice level was decent as promised & the usage of different spice ingredients ( definitely not indian ) made the butter chicken " interesting " .
What pissed me off was the missing naan bread from the box ( not sure if they missed it intentionally or by accident ) - make sure you ask for it next time you order .
Please show them some love ; you will not regret it !
Although it does not sound like much of a difference , i have curly hair so it makes a big difference .
Paid almost $ 50 for something i did not ask for .
I viewed a property , submitted my application and they stated they could not reach the owner to see if the owner liked my application or not .
Onq never followed up about my pictures or rental insurance , on the lease it stated i received 3 copies of the front door , only one of the keys was cut correctly , i had to cut more keys .
Horrible customer service and once my lease is up i will not be renewing with this company !
You do not get much for your money .
Not sure we will go back .
But , bailey the cashier , was not friendly at all .
I am hoping that is not the norm .
I can not say enough good things about this place .
They did not have a problem with us showing up early and let us check in anyway .
The guy at the front tipped off on using uber or the shuttle they offer ( save the money , do not use a cab ! ) .
I was not with him when it happened and he went up to the front lobby .
I was in a crowded location and could not answer the phone .
They went above and beyond and sent me a text message with a summary of what happened and what the hospital name was ( we are not local ) .
Could not beat the price either .
If you are looking for exquisite and attentive customer service ... keep on looking because you will not find it here !
Our waiter was not friendly , did not smile and did not attempt to create a memorable occasion for us .
They seated us in a way where we are right angles from one another which i did not really like .
I dipped the escargot thoroughly in sauce that came with it and did not taste much , the flavour being missing .
My date thought the garlic bread was well done , and it was but no one is blown away by garlic bread .
The olives were nice and the pickled peas were different but not really for us i think .
The steak itself was pretty good , though i remember going " hmmm " at our two previous steakhouses , ruth 's chris and elements at niagara falls , and i did not do that here .
I find i did not have to do this at other steak places .
It was not the exceptional steak i was hoping to find .
The impressive décor could not make up for lack of customer service and high price vs. quality of the food .
I would not recommend it to others and i definitely would not come back .
And in my honest opinion , it is not worth it at all ...
The honeybar was good but not worth the price , at all .
I can not comment on the service because none of the three workers greeted us when we walked in and you do not interact with anyone when ordering ; it 's all done on a self - ordering screen .
But now , i probably would not come here again by my own decision .
I have been to enough places and i have never had it with it .
It was kinda weird but for me i was not a big fan .
Not the best but it 's alright
No wait to get in .
I did not care for my chicken mush bowl at all ... was way over - sauced with a vinegar - ridden sauce .
Could not wait to get out of there .
I was not sure at first because they nickel and dimed me a little bit .
It started out as a good pedi - a little mechanical and less spa like at first - it s worth noting it was redeemed with a very good leg massage and in the end she did not up charge me for the buff and shine .
I would probably come back but i would not prioritize this place over my usual place .
It 's just not quite amazing but every bit of a 4 + which i consider a good score .
I am just going to be honest , i am not a huge fan of las vegas .
I can not really hate on it .
Probably not ideal though , if you are trying to party into the wee hours of the morning .
If they are not located right in the midst of the action , they make it easy to get there .
Because apparently the 2,000 mile difference between hawaii and tahiti , need not apply .
There are exceptions , but certainly not for me in las vegas .
Not really worth going into details about , since maybe it could have just been me .
And while it may not be for everyone , i definitely enjoyed the quiet and peace that staying here granted me .
My only complaint is how annoying the server was coming over to our table to micromanage what we eat , she kept saying if you do not finish this dish well charge you !
And when we ordered dessert , she would not bring it until we " cleared our food " !
I could not be more pleased .. thank you audio tint express
We had our doubts walking in hoping it was not yet another buffet and we were happy to be wrong !
The inside has been completely renovated and you would not even know the building had once housed a buffet .
We were not in the mood for full hibachi experience , but peeking there revealed several hibachi stations with chefs putting on the standard show for patrons .
He noted it did lack a little flavor but nothing that a little soy sauce could not solve .
The food is okay , but was not enough to compensate for the poor service we received .
Waitress brought over the check ; must have then heard us complaining about the service because she brought another check with 18 % gratuity added and then proceeded to say we could nt pay at the table and must pay up front , where no one was available to take our payment .
Mind you , there was someone there - they just could not take our payment .
When we are about ready to just walk out , our server comes , we give her the check with no gratuity added and she still puts it through with gratuity .
If you are hangry , this is not for you .
Food is good ; ultimately not worth the hassle .
My repair quotes were no higher than several i priced on my own , and some were actually lower even with labor costs .
The service style is different since they provide a checklist of the ayce menu which is not as diverse with the choices but at least it still kept the special rolls .
Cheese wontons shrimp & squid tempura vegetable tempura dynamite roll just a quick note , every item after sushi pizza ... i do not have pictures for because those idiots devoured them before i got pictures of it .
[ 1 star ] i did not know what i wanted to eat , cause everything look so good , so i decided to order the " all american slam . "
I like this place the best because : - it 's a lot cleaner than other area salons - the people are always friendly and seem to recognize their customers - they keep expanding their options , including new colors - there is enough going on that i can stay entertained while sitting through the hour - long process of getting a gel manicure - the prices are competitive with other local salons i have never had a bad service and i highly recommend this salon .
Not one person acknowledged our presence or greeted us !
We will not be patronizing this chain .
Really used to like coming in to see mary at the counter area but apparently she is no longer there .
There is nothing worse than feeling like you are not worthy of someone 's time .
Could not get our waters refilled quickly , food came out cold , waitress was impersonal and the cashier was awfully rude as well .
Could not be happier .
I have never gotten so many compliments .
Stephanie at the front desk is the epitome of great customer service and proves her understanding that customer relationships are not just built between the stylist and client in the chair .
While the prices are not exactly cheap , you definitely are getting what you pay for .
Bambu i still love you but last few times i have come in the quality has not been what i have come to expect .
I ended up feeding the coconut to my dog because i did not want it .
I will still keep coming back but if things continue like this i am not sure how much longer that will last ...
I settled on shine based on the reviews , and i have not been disappointed .
It 's not cheap - expect to pay upwards of $ 150 if you are doing cut / color - but well worth it !
No really , not going to sit here and say what 's good on the menu because every single bit of it is the best whatever of that you have ever had .
I said i was not going to do that and i did .
This is one of my favorite little mexican restaurants of all time , you can not go wrong here , give it a shot and you will not regret it !
The place was clean , there was not a wait , and the best part was on mondays and tuesdays they have 25 % off on all threading .
Nothing special , but not bad either .
This will be the new stay - at hotel for channel 70 productions when we are not on the strip .
Do not forget to tip the driver .
Flat screen , but no hd signal .
This hotel is also part of we - do not - wash - your - sheets - because - it 's - the - green - thing - to - do scam .
Lastly , a very nice continental + breakfast ( limited hot food ) is served at no charge .
Food is pretty good here , service not so much .
On our most recent visit , we ordered : congee ( dried fishstock & pork bone & peanut ) - ordered the small size and most of the bowl was pork bone , so not as much congee as we would have liked chili turnip patties - turnip cubes were mushy this time around .
Also did not come with enough soy sauce .
No sauce and they added rice when i specifically said i only wanted veggies .
No reimbursement ... or anything ... nothing .
The food is not good and is overpriced .
I would not give this place a try .
Not worth it .
The rooms and elevator were clean and there were earplugs on the night stand ( probably because this hotel is close to the airport although i do not remember hearing the airplanes .
Stopped in the store on saturday , they did not have what i wanted in house but said the had one in tempe and could have it by tuesday ; i said i wanted to see if someone had it in house and would get back to him .
We could not find one , so i emailed the salesman saturday night telling him i wanted it and to have it brought out to the store ; i followed up with a phone call on sunday and i got it ordered .
Today i went to pick the item up and it was not there ; it was shipped to a different store and sold .
Needless to say i am not very happy right now ...
I will not be going back to this store !!
It is usually placed next to the salt and pepper , but if you do not see it , ask the waitress !
It s as cheap or cheaper then mcdonalds , except you can rest easy knowing you are at a restaurant , not a fast food place that has a " character " called " the grimace ! "
Would not do it again .
My stylist barely talked to me after i showed her the picture of what i wanted and did not have a friendly attitude .
They did give me a glass of wine and a little bag of samples when i left , but i was not impressed with the experience or the price tag at this place .
Try the salsa roja if you are not into spice like me .
I never ate this food before but it was great and i will come back .
I did not get seen until 15 minutes after my scheduled time .
No one said anything to me as i watched clientd arrive after me and get seen before me .
I decided to leave without saying anything as i will not be going back .
I also did not have a huge budget to try to fix it .
Sometimes it s pretty good , sometimes not so much .
Remember the bill only covers food and tax , no tip .. " .
Customer service is not the best .
Although it is not on the strip the place and people make up for that .
Can not wait to try the tots and rosemary sausage !
So sad that they do not have one in kentucky !
The bubble tea we ordered were the actually bubble tea , we did not specify the slushie version which i would of enjoyed more .
Definitely a go - to spot when it comes to congee and dim sum can not wait to go back soon
I can not say enough about how great this store is and these employees are !
I will never shop around again !
Can not wait to buy a water softener from them :)
If they really felt like it could be a contender , i have got some news - it 's not .
It was like we were " dap toi " ( sharing a table with separate bills ) , extremely uncomfortable and tight and so noisy that we could not hear the conversation two persons over .
The food was passable , but not up to the quality of other congee queens i have eaten at ( 4 in total now ) .
I do not even feel like recommending any of the dishes .
Do not sleep on their sides either .
Unfortunately you can not give a company or business zero stars , so i will be forced to leave the review with one star .
This particular refrigerator was not available to see in the store , so it was purchased without being seen in person .
The first delivery team to come to the house could not install the refrigerator , as they were unprepared .
They did not bring the right tools to install the refrigerator , and the installation had to be rescheduled .
The next team installed the refrigerator and after using the refrigerator my mother and her fiancee quickly realized this was not a good fit for them .
To pay $ 11,000 for a refrigerator that does not work for an individual due to medical reasons and be forced to pay almost $ 3,000 for a restocking fee is disgusting .
This is far , far from " top notch customer service . " spencer 's also said it did not matter if the refrigerator was only one day old , they would not take it back or exchange it .
Do not use this company !!!
I had the chicken korean firecracker noodle dish which is supposed to be spicy ( it was recommended by the young man who took my order ) ; it however was not spicy at all .
I am so glad this place is here since i have moved back from orange county i can not get che as easily as i did last year .
Definitely a great stop any time during the summer and it 's located in the lee lee 's plaza where dq used to be so not hard to find at all .
Went here to tint my car and can not say enough .
No star !
Hubby's was done but mine they could not see weird since i only put it in 3 mins after his and i gave them well over 30 mins from the 20 they quote for ready for pick up .
Still took another 20 to get all together 50 min total not 20 .
Anyways finally get my order get home to see that my food is not cooked to order so i still had to finish cooking it at home and my order was incomplete .
I call them and the manager knew they did not complete my order great customer service not !
And the website does not know how busy the restaurant was .... really !!??
But no you had attitude because you only had one order and you could not see my other order and walked away leaving standing there like i did not matter you could have said " let me check on your order i will be right back " i honestly believe this was done on purpose .
No excuses .
If you are not a fan of the coconut flavor , they also have other smoothies and drinks to choose from .
At this point , they do not serve any food or snacks ( which is fine by me ) .
I can not be any happier to see that chandler , arizona is slowly becoming like my town rowland heights in ca . with boba place around the corner , glazier snow across the street and now this delicious store for drinks , i am so happy that they are all in here .
When they are not swamped with walk - ins and appointments , service here is top notch .
They did not apply enough coats and it was see through in parts .
A friend recommended i come here and i must say i was not disappointed .
We wanted a place where we could sit and talk for a long period of time and not feel guilty about depriving someone else of a table .
Not looking for gourmet food .
No need to worry ...
I have been here several times now and there 's never been anything wrong .
I always have good food and good service , but it always feels like everything is just not quite impressive or worth bragging about , considering octagon 's fine dining aspirations and price point .
The octagon is simply not in the same league with tier 1 steak houses in toronto like harbour sixty or jacob and co. and i would suggest that it lands in the lower end of the tier 2 places , delivering a more upscale environment , but similar food quality , to a place like smith brothers in scarborough .
So in the end , i have always had a solid meal , with solid service , and i have enjoyed repeatedly devouring huge baskets of garlic bread , plus a ton of olives and skinny hot peppers , so i typically leave feeling satisfied , but like things did not quite manage to live up to the price i paid .
Then , the day before delivery was scheduled , kent calls to tell me the microwave was not available and would be delivered the following week .
Kent was not apologetic whatsoever .
When the appliances were delivered , i noticed the extended warranty was not on the dishwasher .
Having never received an invoice from kent for the added warranty , i thought maybe he simply added the warranty in exchange for his mistake on the microwave .
He charged us , which is ok , but he never sent us a bill .
Suggestion : shop at spencer 's if you have to , but do not buy from kent webster .
First off , i can not even rate the food because we never got to sit down and eat and had to go somewhere else for dinner .
15 min later we check with the original hostess again and they had not even put us back on the list after realizing their error !
They gave us a small gift card but otherwise did not seem very apologetic .
We left sumo and walked to a really great indian food place nearby with amazing food and service , so the night was not lost .
We may try sumo again but not on a busy night like that until they learn to manage a crowd .
Not sure where to start .
First of all , pay no nervermind to the losers who posted 1 or 2 stars .
Every food joint on the planet will have someone who does not like for one reason or another .
When its 1 or 2 or 3 bad reviews out of 40 ... it does not affect my decision at all .
It is not our first choice .
We went to mr congee but we could not find a parking spot there so we decided to give this congee restaurant a try .
The restaurant is very noisy as any other busy chinese restaurant so we would not expect any difference .
The seafood was not very fresh , so the entire congee had unpleasant smell .
There were a lot of ginger slices inside the congee , which was very annoying since i do not eat ginger so i had to take them one by one .
I do not know whether the food was always that bad in congee queen , or it was because of the christmas eve and the main chef was taking a break .
The dining experience was so terrible that we would not give it another try .
No doubt this is a classy place with your all male staff ( one woman at coatcheck ) and beautiful pod and decor .
Our waiter never cracked a smile but was polite .
I had the full rack of ribs and was not impressed .
Not impressed .
All in all , i guess i would come back , but i would stick to the steak and not order the mash .
A few things to note : - conveniently located in shopping center in dilworth - threading is walk - in only ( no appointments ) - there was one woman working , but she worked quickly and was amazing !! - cost is $ 12 + tip ( 25 % off on mondays ! )
Oh boy , will not return .
I tried to eat it cold on a sandwich with some doctored up dressing this morning and still a no go .
Now , he 's easy to please but said it was not really good ; was not the temp he wanted it ( over done ) and the seasoning was " off " .
Do not come here ....
Please do not come here no no no no no hell to the no ... my daughter can do a better job then this ...
Was definitely not a fan of my pedicure .
Prices are not bad though
Even went on you tube to find out how to manually unlock the car since no electronics worked .
I really enjoy how she always asks her customers the way they want their eyebrows done or what they are trying to achieve , not the way she thinks they should be done .
Another thing i love about her is that she does not rush .
A few people may walk in and have to wait while i am in the chair but i have never felt like she was rushing through my session to get to the next person .
Yes there 's often a line during the lunch and dinner rush hours , and ' intimate ' is not the first word you will think of ( i.e. , take your boy - / girl - friend some other place for a romantic vd-type dinner ) , but the food is usually of decent quality .
When i had my daughter and my parents came out to visit , i told my mom she needed to open a chè shop in this same exact plaza because there is not one and she literally laughed in my face .
I can not wait to come back .
Sadly , i will not be returning to this shop the next time i am in this area .
Anyway , my burrito did not say cheese , but it had eggs , cheese , peppers , onions and i added rice .
Place is tucked away deep in the corner of strip mall , so tough to find , but i was not looking for it , so that makes it a better discovery .
I have never been disappointed with ricardo's .
Remember : you are going for the food , not the ambiance .
Happy with this business as they did a walk around with me on my loved beamer to make sure " no new scratches " from work to be performed .
When you have tinting done your not to open windows for 3 days , they put green do nt open windows stickers over power window switches .
She 's super sweet , attentive , and shapes my brows exactly how i 'd like each and every time and she 's sooooo gentle handed so i never get any cuts like i usually would with others !!
Honeygrow is my go to place when i do not feel like cooking dinner , but want a home cooked meal .
You will not be disappointed with your yummy bowl of tastiness , enjoy !
Our server seemed slightly overwhelmed and frazzled ( not uncommon on a busy night ) , but was still friendly and made sure we got everything we needed !
Located in a huge strip mall , but this is closer to the di side , but not quite the corner , if that 's any help ( directly across the star costume store ) .
Hubby set an appointment ( this past saturday morning @ 9 am ) for the new car ; it would take two hours ( no biggie , we had some errands and lunch ) , and just in time for the summer vegas heat ( noticed lately that hardly any of the newer cars come with tint , but just an observation ) .
We did not see any bubbles !
On the door handles , there were a couple of orange " do not roll up windows " stickers to remind us ( 3 - 5 days , suggested ) .
I highly recommend this business , seriously , they know exactly what they are doing , and there 's no pressure , or up - sells , here .
Also they do not listen to your requests .
I asked for pointed nails and they just said no it looks better square .. which has never happend to me before .
My nails were often left lop - sided and misshapen too , and when i pointed it out they would either act really irritated and kind of fix it or just pretend they did not hear me .
The atmosphere is lavish , the food is pretty top notch , i had the steak neptune and escargots , boyfriend had the baby back ribs for appetizer ( the were not fall off the bone but still tasty ) and the rib eye bone in was delish .
It 's not one of the best hotels i have stayed at , but it did have some of the best staffs i have ever met .
Due to one of the timeshare benefits , we stayed at this hotel for free , so i really could not have complained if it turned out badly , however , this hotel was beautiful !
Complimentary breakfast was not all that great ( mostly just a bagel , some fruit and coffee ) , but since we were hardly up during the bfast hours , i did not really mind .
There are also shuttles that go back to the hotel , but we never used it so i can not comment on that .
They did not panic at all , which was much appreciated .
I was not sure where to even begin , but kameron offered to help us figure out how to change our flights that we would obviously miss .
Not to be confused with tahiti village : )
I got a side of the salsa verde ( mint and jalapeno - not spicy , very yum ! ) and my husband got a side of all three hot sauces ( he said they were not overly hot , but they were tasty ) .
I got a side of the salsa verde ( mint and jalapeno - not spicy , very yum ! ) and my husband got a side of all three hot sauces ( he said they were not overly hot , but they were tasty ) .
Trust me you will not miss your fight if you hiding out at this hotel as the landing strip is directly across sunset blvd .
Not like other hibachi
But it will not be our last !
It would have been nearly perfect had the steak not been over cooked .
Installation perfect do not have bubbles. and ..
I saw brett who is a few weeks new to shine salon ( although not new to hair styling ) and he worked a miracle on the coloring by restoring the brunette coloring i had back to the blond i desired .
I am trying to grow my nails out / strengthen the nail beds , so planned to forego gel polish , but since no one asked , offered , or recommended anything in the way of gel polish , specials , combos , etc. , when directed , i chose a regular polish .
The chair was very relaxing ; no real complaints about the pedicure , though i was a little embarrassed by the cleavage of the young lady ( and i am not a prude ) ; pretty decent callous removal , even though i only chose the " regular " pedicure ; leg massage was very nice .
Next thing i knew she had clipped my longest nail with a pair of big clippers , then proceeded to clip them all ( no need stopping her at that point because it would have looked weird ) ; however , the one nail i had expected to be clipped and filed was not even touched .
The polish went on and even then seemed a bit thick , but , hey - i am not the technician .
After she started the polish , she asked why i did not like gel ; i told her no one mentioned it , but i did not want my nail beds filed on , like i have had done before , to which she replied they do not do that there ; even though i expressed interest , she made no suggestion to do it or start over .
Needing to get to my interview , i looked at the manager , standing behind the counter , and asked if he thought they were ready ; he said oh , sure ... did not even check , but i got the feeling he was waiting for me , so i gathered my things carefully and went to pay .
When i asked the name of my technician , he did not even know , but did find out .
Not having any time , i smoothed them and poured water on them asap ( a quick set trick from an old manicurist ) , and hid my fingers during the interview .
While much busier , the lady manager ( i think , no one introduced themselves ever ! )
Came right over and loudly proclaimed they would fix for free , though she denied anything being wrong with the polish , that it was probably my fault for rushing ... but why had not i done gel nails ?
( i see someone else mentioned the huge amount of giggling , seeming side exchanges , and foreign conversation , which i do find to be a little disrespectful . ) my new caretaker was polite , made suggestions / created my color , but did ask why i liked my nails so short ; though i think that was a little impertinent ( but not as much as her cleavage ; no i am not a weirdo , but worse than the day before ! ) , i responded i did not , that her colleague had snipped them off !
I paid ; i left ... and will not go back .
I am sure this place is good for some , but not for me .
Note : the shop is quiet enough , no fumes , fairly clean - though never did see sterilized equipment , and the restroom / hall area were kind of dingy .
Not only was the salon clean and absolutely gorgeous ... the nail technicians / artists were all fabulous as well !
Would have given it 5 stars had the steak not been over cooked , making it a little dry and tough .
Not fantastic , not earth shattering but ...
Or a god ... not sure but it felt like a super power .
The zombie like customers could not even remove their brains from their phone for 2 seconds to acknowledge their order number and pick it up !!
I could not have done that ... no way .
However , honeygrow did not quite live up to the hype .
I like the idea but in practice , it made the process more confusing and time consuming - not to mention 2 of the 4 computers kept freezing up .
Overall , honeygrow did not wow me .
It was not fantastic but it also was not bad .
I would stop in again if i did not have any other healthy options around .
We paid only $ 40 / night for this place on priceline.com as we were not planning to do much in the hotel but sleep .
They apparently have a shuttle service , but we drove , so we did not use this .
The only thing that we found weird is that the tv does not have many channels and there is no pay - per-view option .
I always take that route and i have no idea why i have not noticed it before lol .
I tried not to fill my tummy with the bread before our main but could not stop myself !!! :(
I could not believe how big the portion was .
We were not sure whether to get an appetizer or not , and the server said the portion of the platter is big and will not disappoint , and it sure did not !
We could not finish it so we asked for the leftover to be packed to go .
The sides were okay - did not stand out as much as the seafood .
I 'd say just anticipate that you may not be able to sit inside so you are not disappointed .
I am not rushed and i can order my food exactly like i like it .
Your palate will thank you , but your wallet may not depending on how custom you made your meal .
The sleek , minimalistic interior design was open , bright and inviting though a little more seating would not be a bad idea .
They had everything down to a strainer and a wine opener , so no need to bring your own .
I liked that it was a bit off the strip but close enough where it was not an arm and a leg to pay for a taxi .
Ordered fajitas and when i got home no tortillas in the bag , called and was told i realized when you walked out the door , no attemp to come after me and not apologetic .
$ 24 for 2 meals and no chips and salsa included unless you pay extra , cheaper in a restaurant and then to get home and not have all your order .
Not a happy customer .
I do not think there was anything organic in the organic milk and honey option i got .
I never saw anything resembling honey but they did pour some white murky liquid into the water .
No sign over the polish area to warn people .
Not tod english anymore .
Will not be back again .
This place is so unprofessional i would rather not get my nails done then come here again .
Oh and when i handed the lady the tip ( should not have even tipped at all ) , she did not even say thank you , she just said " k " and walked away ... lol
There is a lot of selection on the all you can eat menu - even for those who do not like raw fish .
This place is actually not bad !
But my friend wanted to go here so i figured why not give ayce sushi another shot .
I was not a fan of : rocknroll maki ; squid tempura .
I would rate their sushi 7/10 ; it 's not just good but very good ; but not excellent ; but hey the price is right .
You have to eat all you order or they charge you a surcharge for everything you did not eat which i think is fair to avoid waste and to keep prices reasonable .
Although their waitresses do not speak perfect english , they are helpful and efficient which is great in my books .
Nothing on the menu that i do not like .
I did not look at their sushi or regular japanese menu so i do not know about their pricing for those entrees .
If it was not the soft opening , it would have been 3 stars .
They had messed up my salad order and did not bring the food out at the same time , and then just could not get the dressing down right so i just ate the salad as was .
Unimpressed with the stuffed avocado and the boy did not love the quinoa too much .
There 's about 2 seats , maybe 3 at the bar , and a couple of tables so not exactly the spot where you 'd go grab a cold one on a patio somewhere when the weather is nice .
If i could ... i would rate this place - 5 stars i can not believe that a place like this is still in business me and a bunch of friends went to this place , in search of a good ayce place .
Sadly when we ordered our sushi , they decided to place salt in some of the pieces of the sushi , after arguing for five minutes with the waitress ( lanuage barrier ) she took the pieces away and decided not to charge us .
Which were not advertised on the menu .
I will never go back !
I placed a takeout order tonight and when i returned discovered that the order was not what i placed .
I attempted to call the restaurant twice ; no one answered , nor was there voicemail ( there was no one in the restaurant when we picked up the order so i do not think it was too busy to answer the phone ) .
I tried to fill out the comment section on the website and immediately was met with a message stating " failed to send your message . " wondering why i would ever return to a restaurant that does not appear to want business ( how can someone call to place a takeout order when no one answers ? ) , gives incorrect orders to patrons and has no way to contact anyone .

I am a real estate investor and do not usually feel comfortable about out of state property management .
Not surprisingly there was a lineup at around 6:30 pm on a weekday , so the demand is definitely there for this branch .
I likely will not return to this branch as i have had better experiences in the other branches .
The biggest con for me in staying here is there is no shuttle to the strip .
I grabbed some late night sushi and tempura and was not impressed .
Though the atmosphere is very interesting , it was not enough to make up for everything else .
Very poor food , made by people who obviously have never eaten asian food .
An employee could not speak english and did not understand what duck sauce was .
I was actually in awe when i walked into the venue as the outside is not much to look at but once you step in ohhhh my .
For those not familiar , this is not a place that just sells congee !
You can definitely find cheaper chinese food , but you usually get what you pay for ... while the centrepoint mall location is not the first one i have tried , it 's definitely one of the best .
The staff are not particularly warm and friendly , but this is on par with what you would expect at most other chinese restaurants ( unfortunately ) .
The only other drawback to this location is that their drinks ( in particular , their hk - style milk tea ) is not as smooth and delicious as the kennedy / sheppard location .
The alaskan roll and the holly wood roll were not all that special but enjoyable all the same .
You can not go wrong with anything on the menu !
He told me that " manicures do not last at all " as though the concept of a manicure was completely new to me .
She followed that by dousing the open wounds with acetone despite the fact that i had no polish on .
On my way out , danny wasted no opportunity to again reprimand me for leaving too early ( " your nails are so wet " - i had sat for 15 minutes waiting for them to dry ... ) definitely the worst manicure i have ever had .
We both had long weeks and needed some pampering , plus i have never had a pedicure before .
The place looked clean and welcomed us even though we did not have appointments .
I was not about to create a scene too and i really just wanted to relax so i bared with the tingly pain .
The nail polish i am not too happy about .
Overall i had an amusing first pedicure experience , however , i will never return to this place .
Will not be staying here again .
The bathroom tub , sink and sink in room do not drain .
There was no dish washer in this room .
You have dishes but no rack to dry them .
The jacuzzi jets did not work by the pool .
If you have at&t you will not have cell service only the slow wifi .
Not worth the money !
While on this past trip i was told they parted ways with todd english and are no longer affiliated .
Considering they have not had their grand opening yet , that 's saying a lot .
I can not even believe this is the same space .
I mean , the floors are not sticky and the lighting is great .
I was very disappointed with the hong kong style lobster which was soggy and not fresh .
Samosa are not good , do not order them .
Way too much flour & potato filling does not have much flavor .
Value of not driving to dilworth
No question no doubt !
The beans were okay , if i did not use the salsa with every bite i would say they would have been a little bland .
First time at honeygrow , and it definitely will not be my last !!
Did not wait too long .
They do not skimp on the toppings , so you are paying a decent price for what you are getting .
No push to purchase product and the cost was worth every penny .
I do not often get facials but my time with jane was excellent .
I was actually laughing in pain but either way it was not as bad as i was expecting .
It would not have been bad but the cleaning staff were using them most of the time and their carts took up the entire elevator .
Strangely enough , our friend , larry the cockroach did not seem to mind the temperature as he was scurrying around the bathroom in pure delight !
My wife did not have any shoes on when she found him at 2:30 am so she just put the trash can over him so he would not be inclined to crawl in bed with us .
That 's not the kind of threesome i keep requesting !
Not bland at all , and the portions are decent .
I do not even know if he realized that his drawing looked nothing at all like the picture he had right in front of him the whole time he was painting .
You will not be disappointed .
We set up delivery and told them the only time we can not have the delivery was between 11:30 - 1:00 pm or they could come any time the following day .
We told the driver that 's the only time day we can not have a delivery .
I told the driver we would reschedule my appointment to 2:00 pm. at 2:00 pm no delivery the finally showed up at 2:30 pm .
They only had the washer but no dryer .
Also they did not have the stackable kit .
The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing .
I called the salesman and explained my frustration and he blamed me on the delivery and the fact that they did not have the stackable kit .
Not today .
It 's a rather new " chain " but do not let that word fool you , this place delivers quality food that makes you forget it 's a chain .
I have never had a bad meal here .
Either way , you will not be let down .
They will do the best shape with what you have got , so if you are trying to grow out your brows to even them out , be sure to tell them , because they are not going to ask .
Very pleasant .. the next day 3 nails came off in whole pieces .. i came and spoke to her and she said no problem she will fix .. but they normally do not guarantee .. i said i understood and thank you .
Very pleasant .. the next day 3 nails came off in whole pieces .. i came and spoke to her and she said no problem she will fix .. but they normally do not guarantee .. i said i understood and thank you .
I came to day and owner immediately said we no guarantee !
And some guy came into picture and called my daughter to counter and i told him we would wait for girl and he ignored me 2 times .. i asked his co-workers does he not understand english ??
She will be hour ... i said no she is almost done with pedicure .
And he can not even see her and said no she be 1 hour !!
I said no i get pedicures monthly .. i know how long they take !!
It 's too bad there is not a 1 / 2 star .... they original girl is the only reason they get 1
We all know that your face greets the world right ?.... so why not make sure it 's picture perfect .
I must admit i have not tried any other person there ( i am a loyal customer ) especially when you have done me proud , but the flow of people that comes thru the idolize doors speaks for itself .
I just moved to the area so wanted to try something new and closer to me .... needless to say i will never go back !
It was horrible worst service and i could have done better myself went in for pedicure and manicure left after the manicure did not even want to finish .
I am not sure . this place would have gotten a 1 star based on the type of service received ... but the food was on point .
Got the usual ( the i do not need a menu , i already know what to order ) - minced pork & fish w/ beans , crispy chicken , fried squid w/ spicy salt , cantonese chow mein ..
Veggies on other dishes not overcooked ...
I understand it 's diner food , can not expect much ; but there are still some great items .
Not once did the server drop by .
I was already half way done , i honestly did not want to make a big deal about it because i had just gotten off a late swing shift at 2 am .
Whatever man , not everyone that comes in is an asshole .
But you never know who you are serving , and not every industry people are going to be nice about it but i let it slide , only because i had a great night at my job .
Will not be stopping in here again , i 'd rather try my luck back at southpoint .
I am sure that no one is reading this review because they are curious about the vegetarian options at a steakhouse , but i can not emphasize enough how thrilled i was with my dinner .
I did not even have to eat the emergency granola bar i had in my purse .
This would have been a 5 - star review if it was not for the service .
The waiters were polite and professional , but not warm or friendly , or particularly attentive .
I might not have noticed if it was not for the calibre of service i saw at some of the other tables .
The cute cashier also let me know that there is no lard in the beans !
Not a huge fan .
Not a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot .. does not seem fresh .
Not a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot .. does not seem fresh .
With other options in the area , i do not plan on returning .
I could have been served burnt toast ( i was not food was out of sight ) and still give 5 stars because of the manger .
There are no waiters and waitresses .
Tons of healthy options - no seafood option : - chicken , steak and veggie only .
I ordered the wings and the rice bowl - the fresca queso cheese is a shaved fresh queso not a sauce ( like at a mexican restaurant ) .
Live not far from here so came down to try it out !
The ambiance was amazing , however , the food did not reflect that .
Their platter came with no meat , only seafood .
All of us have never been there before , and likely never to return .
Horrible communication ... moved into a filthy house , yard filled with garbage , exterior windows and screens caked in dirt , aweful smell in the house and a pool that they expected me to fill up with a hose that i had to purchase and with no compensation .
I came from across the country and had to put a non refundable 2000 $ deposit down so i had no recourse once i saw the house .
This market definitely allows renters no rights , we have to just deal with it .
It s been 9 days and they have sent no one out to fix anything and they expect me to not only schedule all of the appointments but have all the vendors out on my personal time .
Always welcoming and never pretentious - shine is my go to now that i live in charlotte .
An out standing restaurant that has not lost it 's touch in time .
Do not do it .
Two nails are crooked , one is too wide ---- wider than my thumb , and it 's not the shape i asked for .
You have doubled your sales in a year , opened an extention to the salon , hired more people and you can not afford to pay your credit card machine fees ?
And the best part is that there is a lexus parked out front every day but you can not take on those credit card charges ???
And for the record , i was not trying to get free anything , since i double tipped you .
I asked the server to take it back and have the eggs over easy more or less and the manager grabs the my plate from the window and stands there arguing with me that it 's " cooked in a bun " well no shit it 's an egg in a basket genius !
It 's not rocket science on how to make an egg in a basket !
No wonder this place looks depressing .
I would never recommend this place
Never had such a giant bowl of seafood congee before ( the house super bowl ) .
Decent food for the price , but do not expect high quality ingredients .
Beware not to tip twice .
During times of low - carbing this is a go to for skillets as denny's has a number of them that you can substitute the hash browns for spinach and not mess up your diet .
Seems like everytime i come here there is only a couple waitresses and they are not really on point with getting her order , refilling your coffee or virtually any aspect of the job .
I have had the phó and the banh mí , which no one probably orders since it 's not a very well - known dish .
They were both really good , and my family makes banh mí homemade , so i can tell you i am not a novice when it comes to this vietnamese sandwich !
My father ordered the lemongrass chicken , and i tried it - the spice was not the lame , bland type you usually receive from fast - food .
**** never think about entering into an agreement with them !
Not kidding :
Because i was desperate and could not find another place in my price range .
Apparently , legal documents are no barrier to the greed of this organization .
Combo seemed most reasonable the menu on the drive through is $ .75 cheaper on tacos than inside the items looked good on the menu .. no tea ever arrived and no one asked for my order nor approached to direct me towards the counter for service so i got up and i left .... hoping that they turn the place back into a long john silvers
The only reason that i am not giving four stars is the price ( hey , a girl can dream , can not she ? ) but the prices are fair and you really do get what you pay for :-) .
You need to set aside 15 minutes just to get your food , not counting if you have to wait in line .
It 's an upgraded version of panda express - nicer food options and ambiance - in my mind that does not justify an average of $ 12 for a lunch entree + soda .
Got the tatoki sushi roll and that was mediocre ( not a big fan of cream cheese in my rolls ) majority of the choices incl .
Cheese so it 's difficult to shy away from it and not to mention the offering list is short .
It 's not bad but very different ..
I never tried anything like it before ..
I do not know if it was the texture or what .. but overall it was not bad , i will probably stop by here again to check out all the other drinks they offer ..

I have been here a few times the food is fantastic the place is clean and you can not go wrong with $ 13.99 all you can eat lunch and even dinner is only $ 19.99 the food is absolutely delicious but the service is shit , that 's why there 's one star off and also because we went this monday at 11:30 am but they opened the doors at noon we thought we were mistaken but even the sign on their door said 11:30 am .
If i do not live so far away i would be there everyday !
Lol i can not wait til they have halo - halo tho ....* hint hint * ms. rada .
The made at your table ceasar salad you will find no better .
Old school , not really any flare - except for the made at your table ceasar salad and pepper corn sauce but if that 's that you want .
Can not beat that !
Will never go anywhere else !
My arch was perfect , she follows directions to the t not to mention she was very sweet .
Not impressed whatsoever .
Probably will not be back .
We stayed upstairs on the 3rd floor ( smoking room ) but it did not smell like smoke at all .
The room was clean and we had no complainants .
About 30 minutes ago me and my girlfriend walked in and took a seat the server noticed us and said he would be with us shortly after about 5 minutes go by and then i noticed the two other empty tables got sat and then he gave them menus and drinks instantly he walked by and ignored us 3 times and about 10 minutes went by so we just left on our way out i was hoping he would say something to get us to stay or at the least apologize but he just made eye contact and continued , then i mentioned the great service to him out of frustration and he then replied commenting about our patience and i am pretty upset just because this is not the first time i have experienced terrible service here and i truly do love the food but if i can not even get menus or a guy to take my order then i guess i just will not try anymore .
The steaks are less than average and the service is poor ( we ordered french onion soup which never came , and they mixed up a medium rare order with a rare one ) .
Not very good .
The service was ok and friendly , but the food is just not very good and it is over priced .
The restaurant itself is not huge , but there is still ample seating .
Great proportions for all ingredients and the dressing just the right amount ( not overpowering ) .
The kiddo was not very hungry so he opted to build his own yogurt parfait ( yogurt , fruit , granola ) .
Will not be coming back .
And another memo to the kitchen : a hotdog is not a sausage , despite similar appearance .
I did not think it was possible to mess up " sausage and mash " but congratulations - you did .
We were here for 7 days with no housekeeping services .
So i am from the islands , not many places in the valley have good island food .
Not my intention !
My man dez totally hooked a local brotha up by making this amazing dish , and i am forever grateful , but if you show up asking for the loco moco , do not be upset if they can not make it .
You will not be sorry .
The guys are are very knowledgeable and will not pressure you into unnecessary work .
Then , two hours later , justin called and said that they did not have it available after all .
I was furious and said that was not acceptable .
The next day , when the deliverymen came , they did not have our loaner frig , stating that their boss told them not to bring us another frig , because we already had a loaner .
Lowes is much more customer friendly and do not make false promises to get a sale .
Also , they are not on commission .
I do not enjoy going to the hair salon either , but shine has most definitely made me a believer .
I never once felt as if they were trying to sell me products or more expensive services .
If you re not in a rush to get somewhere then stop in but if you re on break and need a quick boba , then you did yourself a favor by reading my review .
I am not sure who 's fault it is - but when us and our 5 teenagers arrived to check in at tahiti village - we were told that we were actually placed at tahiti resort .
There is absolutely no phone service in the rooms or the hotel .
We asked if we could at least see the rooms , were not even allowed to see the rooms before officially checking in .
The rooms are ok - really , if the pool was not so depressing , we could have made it work .
We tried to talk to the floor management , who was a woman but i do not remember her name , but she was absolutely no help .
We asked if we could switch to tahiti village where we were supposed to be because she told us it was a sister hotel , but she said she would look into it , stalled and never responded or returned our calls as she said she was going to call her manager to ask if we could cancel the reservation for the next two nights ( side note - tahiti village said it happens all the time and it is not their fault - most people are super mad when this happens to them too ! )
An hour later we walked back down to the desk , she had not called the manager at all yet and called her when we were there .
She was not any help , and honestly sounded like she could care less about anything .
We arrived to dozens of towels laying out , apple cores laying all over the ground , chairs were in the pool , and no towels were available for my family .
Like i said , the rooms are ok - and if you have not been to the real tahiti village and do not plan to spend a lot of time in the pools like we did , this place is ok although their management needs an upgrade .
We did not mind too much having to stay there the first night .
I do not recommend this place unless you are a senior citizen wanting peace and quiet away from nice pools and families .
3rd issue my reservation was not on file when arriving and took 30 minutes to rectify .
Not sure if this was expedia or the hotel .
I am not the only one to find bed bugs .
Been coming to jose for a few years now .. would not take my car anywhere else for tint .
Products were delivered when i was not home ; my husband was .
He did not look things over like i do .
I will say that i thought something was wrong with my dryer and i received very prompt and under-warranty service ( it turned out to be a clogged vent in my new - build ) but i am not at all happy with receiving a banged up refrigerator with missing parts .
That thing was not cheap .
The quality of the sushi is not bad , per se , but the whole experience left me vowing to not come back .
Steaks were cooked perfectly though i wonder if they were aged or not as menu does not say ?
I think the fries were not good though .
But you do not want to drive downtown , octagon is a great choice .
I was there last friday on a whim and it was not full so my group of six was seated immediately , but during summer i have also tried to get in without a reservation on a friday night and been turned away because there was a two hour wait .
There is a sign outside the door that states their dress code , which is something like business casual , but some of my group was wearing sneakers and t-shirts ( not me !! hehe ) and they still let us in without even blinking an eye , but i did feel a little underdressed .
Beware , you have to pay the menu price for items you do not eat .
I do not mind this .
People need to realize that food is not free , and if you do not like it , it is not an excuse not to eat it ( think eating at your own house ) .
Only time it is acceptable is if it is not fresh .
I could not be more impressed than i am with onq .
Drinks may be not good sometimes , but customer service will decide 90 % of the success .
I can not , however , recommend this new location ( yonge and steeles ) .
With the restaurant staff 's kids sprinting through the aisles all evening like it 's a playground as they play hide - and - seek , and no responsible parent to address the situation , eat elsewhere .
Not to mention the annoyance to the paying customer .
I have been there 4 times only because it was where i was invited each time , and after tonight you could not pay me to go back .
Words can not describe the lengthy list of neglectful , complacent and rude service we received .
On top of the worst service i have had in my life , and i am not exaggerating ..
Despite the small amount i ate , i felt indigestion , not only from the bland greasy food , but from worrying about how sanitary the preparation was .
If it was not a friend 's birthday plan to eat there , i would have walked out at once or better yet , never set foot in there .
But that was not the case .
He did not try and sell us the most expensive ones in the store , but what we actually needed .
He was very knowledgeable about the different brands and features and why they were good or not good .
I will never go anywhere else for appliances .
No shame here .
I could not get a yes , no , or even a maybe .
It was not until the fourth day when more of my calls went unanswered and voicemails went without response , that i finally decided to once again try to text the leasing agent , only for him to finally respond and tell me that the property was no longer available .
Honestly , after the neglect of even potential tenants this company displays , it 's probably for the better that i did not get the house .
I do not know when the best time to come cause it seems they are always busy no matter what time .. and make sure once a server comes to you finish whatever you need to say cause it will take a while before they come back and check in you cause the people that bring the food to the table are in training .. would i go back to this place yes it is worth the money and fast service ..
Our burger was delicious , fries crispy and they knew we were splitting it so they cut the burger ahead and we did not have to ask for extra plates .
I am in and out and do not have to wait forever and a day like other shops and they have a cool little waiting area for customers .
The tempura had no crisp to it and was soaked in oil .
Service was good though and the food was not expensive .
I have been here many times and never been disappointed but somehow this little place was forgotten in my mind .
I guess it 's because i do not make it around here much .
You know , it was not just a tostada .
Well , as famished as i was , i tried not to gobble and managed to slow down to enjoy the flavors .
Not only are they accommodating , yummy but i enjoyed a clean yet tasteful dinning experience .
When i called them to rectify the situation they were not helpful at all , acted as though they could not care less .
After feeling mocked over the phone i told her i 'd call her back and when i did , no one picked up .
When the customer service rep at just - eat also tried to contact them they did not pick up .
I would not recommend this place .
Please keep personal belongs safe and hidden away because housekeeping can not be trusted !!!!!
They told me they would get back to me as soon as possible or by the end of the day but day after day they never contacted me .
I had to go out of my way each day to contact them to get an update and it took them four days to tell me that they finally checked with housekeeping and the items were not found or there in the room ( obviously they 'd be gone after not checking right away ) i know for a fact my items were left behind in that room and the fact that they took so long to get back to me was absolutely ridiculous !
I hope everyone else has a more pleasant stay there but we will no not be back and i hope that this review can help anyone else out so they do not have a shitty experience like we did .
But the food is too great not to share .
Not exactly what i expected .
Will not recommend to friends or family .
The salmon sashimi quality was quite low , the shrimp tempura was not freshly made , the ' steak ' teriyaki was hard to stomach , the new bacon shrimp tempura was gross , you get the point it was terrible !!!
We had eaten there just a few months ago and it was pretty good so we returned , but never again .
The red sauce taste like it comes straight from a can at least add more spices the carnitas meet is not too bad .
The shredded beef chimichanga was a little better then the wet burrito but not by much the shredded beef was okay it lacked spice .
This food is not worth the price .
The burritos were so bad that my husband and i did not even finish the burritos we threw them out .
Still not enough to get us to go again .
Stopped by here because of the overwhelming positive reviews and was not disappointed !
The staff did not seam to care about this even upon telling them twice of it .
I do not hesitate one second on recommending them if you are looking to rent your house out or looking to become a renter here in arizona .
We did not get any service for about 20 mins .
We did not make a fuss , we calmly waited for our food thinking at least the food will make up for the abhorrent service and wait .
They also did not bring out correct orders , and a few members of our party did not eat , and that was extremely disappointing .
The food was mediocre , not much to judge when it was cold , burnt and arrived an hour later .
Let me tell you , i was not disappointed !
Only reason they do not get 5 stars from me is that the salsa is not great .
The only reason they are not receiving 5 stars is because even though they were very welcoming and quick the lady constantly talked in her other language with a co worker and continuously kept laughing .
This made not only me a little uncomfortable but also the lady next to me who even gave a look as if she could not believe what was happening .
The only reason why they get 4 stars and not 5 is that they are not that quick .
There was no problem with our order .
I did not know what to expect because i had heard mixed things about the dc location .
Decided to give this place a try , to say the least we were not let down .
Minus my fiancé did have a bone in hers but that 's not unexpected .
Fairly standard not too expensive sushi .
It 's fine for what it is , but do not expect fine dining .
I was not very impressed .
Well come to find out i paid the extra fee which i did not mind $ 71.00 .
The room itself was okay , not something you should see in a 4 star hotel or a timeshare like this place .
Maintenance and house keeping seems like they either do not care anymore ( photos will show ) .
Dirty walls , worn furniture , crumbs on the floor , main door does not shut all the way , fridge ice maker does not work .
After showing her photos i taken because she did not want to come up to the room and see for herself as she 's the only employee on duty in the lobby .
The manger did not seem to care other then refund me my upgrade .
When my old esthetician moved away , i had a difficult time finding a replacement but happened to wander into idolize , never realizing that i drive by it almost everyday .
The only reason for the 4 not 5 is the price .
Basically , another one of those no- frills hotels i stayed at for a night or two .
The blend of different fruits and jellies with coconut milk is super refreshing and not too sweet .
The tea itself is not very sweet , but the fresh strawberry on the bottom with the basil seeds is sweet enough to balance the whole drink out .
The tapioca balls were not nice and chewy , but more on the mushy side .
Because the issue is now resolved , my husband and i have decided to not only get the new washer , but also order the matching dryer .
We chose to get the extended warranty and hope that spencer's will reassess the policies with their warranty company so others will not have a similar experience .
This is not to mean there are not excellent salespeople at other locations .
Keep being a perfectionist , it does not go unnoticed ! :)
The service was slow , and the waitress was not nice and friendly enough , to keep me patient .
My food was so plain and not good .
I like denny 's i just do not want to spent money on service like that .
This nail salon is ok , but do not go here expecting a real ' spa ' experience .
We made appointments and did not have to wait , so that was a positive .
One of my friends ' man who did her toes was really friendly and personable , but my guy was not .
Not really the best experience , but my toes came out nice and my little toe design turned out cooler than my friends ( sorry guys ! ) so he gets props for that .
I felt like for a newer salon , the massage chairs were not the best and a lot of the ' fun ' nail colors offered were in off brands ( not opi or china glaze ) ... which makes me wary to try them .
A basic pedi was 22 $ and the nail design was 5 $ , so it is fairly reasonable , but i do not know if i would go back because i had a better experience at a different salon ( nails 8000 ) for around the same price .
They do not care about you except for the rent income .
We rented this house with irrigation system - which has never worked and still does not even though the inhouse maintenance company ( owned by the same person as onq ) allegedly fixed it .
My husband has taken off work for them to come and do repairs and they do not show up .
When we do not work , we do not get paid - so we have lost payroll money in the repair process .
If i were the owner of this house - i would want repairs to be made to keep the property in good repair - apparently that is not a concern by the owner , or at least that 's the way on q makes it sound .
Such as having more smaller portion steaks at a reasonable price for those who do not eat a lot .
Did not expect the tacos to be as big as they were and have as much meat in them as they did .
Can not wait to go back .
Since moving to gold canyon a year and a half ago , i can not find anyplace closer to home that does as good a job with my nails as they do .
Not fast , not slow , not rushed , just fine .
It is not a signature dish .
I was not happy with my stay here at all .
It 's a rip off , do not do it .
Also , it 's obvious they did not clean the tub jets , because when i turned them on a bunch of mildew started floating around in the water .
If you do not like what one does that have you call the other .
Warranty people say oh well we can not schedule till we have parts and those take 10 business days .
Meanwhile we have a fridge that does not work .
Will never buy there again !!!!
The only negative i do have is about the service and not from the wait staff but from the kitchen ; it is slow and frequently they mix up orders .
Most recently my husband and i both ordered 2 tacos and one of my tacos was on his plate but not the end of the world as we just switched them .
If you are in a hurry i would not stop in but if you have some time to sit , relax , and enjoy the ambiance this place will not disappoint .
I asked for egg whites instead of regular eggs , no butter on my toast and eggs .
As she went back to the kitchen to explain the order to the chef he yelled at her for all the accommodations and so when she came back to us to explain that we could no longer as for anything else to be changed because the chef was mad it put us in a very very uncomfortable situation to where we were hesitate to ask for anything else such as condiments , hot sauce , or anything else .
This was the worst experience ever and we will never go back .
It was not worth the money or stress that it put on us .
We where there to enjoy ourselves and that did not happen .
We felt like we had to sit there with our hands crossed and not say a word because we were going to get scolded by the chef again .
Never going back .
Great price and i would not hesitate to take another vehicle there for tinting in the future .
I did not complain at all and was very courteous .
I realize this is a tough job but a little courtesy goes a little no way .
We started with a drink in the bar because not all of our party had arrived .
The chairs were anchored to the floor so you could not really get close enough to the table to be comfortable .
He did none of the embellishments that make it so fun , he did not even explain the volcano ... his eyes did wander frequently to the soccer game on tv .
He really just did not talk so it was not much of a show .
This is the first time that we ever did not tip the chef .
The couple that came with us had never had a hibachi experience before .
I am still not sure that they had an official hibachi experience .
First of all , let me just say that i do not trust just anyone with my precious eyebrows , so after moving here and being new to the area , i did quite a bit of research before finally picking a place .
So far , i have been here twice for an eyebrow wax and have not been disappointed .
Foremost , i do not like tofu and i know my boyfriend has not eaten it at all and we loved every bite of it .
It 's not cheap ( a typical bowl will cost you around $ 10 - 14 ) , but the ingredients are super fresh and i never felt like the meal was a waste , or too small .
I would not eat here all the time for obviou$ reasons , but it 's certainly a good option for a night out or a special , fresh meal .
I do not believe this place will survive .
Do not think i will be going back .
For that i will never stay here again .
If you can not resolve a matter with respect then you do not need my buisness .
So i do not recommend staying here again .
My nails were already quoted & as she was doing them i did not like the shape then told me it was gon na be 5 $ extra & started clipping my nails off .. she then did not even shape correctly & did not even put my gel coat on so horrible !!!

Bad .. i truly can not believe they are still in business at this point .
I ate here with 2 other people and not a single one of us liked what we ate .
The manager that took our order was rude and not friendly at all .
I over heard a conversation he had with a customer and he was so amatter of fact ' and not considerate at all .
We left the wok box saying ' well , we found a place we will never go to again . ' bad service , bad food , and bad vibes .
Not a fan ...
I could tell our server could not understand everything we were saying but was pretty good still and attentive .
Felt heavy from the oil used to cook them but was not flavourful enough .
I did not go into it with high expectations , but the food and service were incredible !
Often , i get the same thing at a restaurant because i do not want to ask a bunch of questions about the menu and possible substitutions .
I did not want the pitiful portion size at panera and i also did not want to get carried away and make a $ 20 salad at whole foods .
It was very good , but not as spicy as i would have liked .
I was told the brow tint would last between 2 - 4 weeks and let 's just say it did not even last 5 days !
I was careful to not wash my face hard or wipe the brows but it still came off before my trip which was the main reason why i got it !
I do not recommend getting your full face done here on mondays .
Not a very good job even though you are having to pay 27 plus tip on mondays .
Parking in that area is generally not awesome but it 's worth it .
Came in saturday with a friend upon entering we were loudly told ... no appointment you must go come back ... called on monday and made an appointment for 2 pedicures at 6 pm the next day ... arrived at 5:55 .. waited until we were told to go back to the pedicure baths at 6.. the pedicure baths were still dirty and the foot support had lotion and something else gross on it ... a women came in filled up the foot bath with plain water and there we sat and sat for a half hour .. we finally had to leave when the pedicure water got cold ... the entire time we waited danny and vincent were at the nail bar doing another employees nails while her friend who appeared to have too much wine kept placing her dirty pedicure slippers on top of the nail bar ... danny nor vincent seemed to mind and co nt chatting and laughing ... upon leaving i told the rude young man who is always at the front that this was unacceptable and i would be leaving a bad review on yelp .
My nails should not chip that quickly .
For the price i paid , if i have to re-do my nails in less than a week , that 's just not worth it for me .
There is no common look and feel / theme .
The staff , although pleasant , are not well trained .
So if in a hurry , the grill is not the place to go .
Not sure but it 's really quite good .
It 's hard to go wrong especially if you are not in a hurry .
Not something we have experienced before .
I passed by this place many times and was really unclear on what they were selling so i never went in .
Well fear not folks , went in today and was pleasantly surprised .
They had cool car chairs that reclined which i never encountered before ( except in cars ) .
It is not hawaiian by any means but it 's more mexican - american oriented with california surfer terminology strewn across their menus .
My burger was fantastic , their fries are really not great though .
It 's not crispy by any means and it feels soggy but it was fresh .
I am not sure how they achieved such mediocrity in their fries .
I.e. not the one you usually get at food court , much better tried their seaweed and crab meat salad , refreshing as we have had many meat dishes , will order again :)
Even my friend who does not like turnip loves it , it tastes better with their hot sauce ;) also , salt pepper pork chop is very yummy too heehee average : disappointed at bbq duck !
No meat !
I 'd recommend going for the traditional / basic congee which is more original and flavourful in my opinion ( basically the cheaper one at the bottom of the menu ) 10 people , 20 bucks each including tax and tips , not bad at all !
I could not care less about the polish ; i can do that myself .
Although i do not care about the polish , it was done well .
Well ... revising my previous ... was disappointed to learn today that the personal service of taking your order at your table that they offered when they opened has been cancelled .... they are trying to act more lile a fast food chain versus a resturant .... food still awesome .... just disappointed with the reduced / elikinated personal service .... they will dedinately see reduced tips as wwll because who tips for no service .
Atmosphere is casual and somewhat noisy but the place is not for quite dinner , it 's more for groups getting together to have a good drink , great food , in a friendly atmosphere .
Ill never be back here and ill let everyone i know to ignore this place !
I came with my mother - in - law and elena could not have been kinder or more helpful .
After our ntsc ski day , this is the place we head to to forge on chinese food .... prices are cheap and the quality of bbq pork is excellent . , meat is lean ( not fatty ) , warm and amazing .. , the fried tofu / vegetable dish is great too ... free parking at centre point mall but it get s very busy on a saturday night .. the sweet and sour pork was crispy combined with the sweet / sour sauce .. , overall it 's an amazing place for good canto foof
Did not write anything down .
I have a lot of hair , and it 's " ethnic " per say but it did not scare him he was able to cut it in a style that i have not been able to stop playing with it since !
Not to mention shine salon in beautiful clean and the staff if super friendly !
My thought is that the octagon does not like you bringing your children to dinner .
Because of that , i have not and never will return .
( that 's the exact word ) my boyfriend was shocked and then he told him " it 's not good you know " with a disappointed and angry look , i told the waiter " we are giving cash for the tip " then he walked out .
We are so disappointed because we always go here and this was the first time that we were treated like this , after that incident we decided to not give anymore additional tip , my boyfriend and i are both working in a restaurant too ( customer service ) but this is not how we treat customers , they do not even smile .
We will never come back anymore !!!
They have added so many other items on their menu and i can not wait to try more so i can see if there 's a new favorite that exists !
Did not care for the work done and was rushed to pay as my nails did not even get a second coat while they waited for me to sign my receipt .... apparently could not wait

Was not impressed at all in this place i went on a friday around 4 somewhat close to their closing time .
They were somewhat busy but not slammed , the whole time i felt very rushed .
I do not have high pinterest expectations on my nail design so i said whatever you are good at i am fine with .
The design came out looking horrible the simple flower looked like i did it and there is a reason why i do not do my nails .
Also it was not very clean and i had these little gnats flying all over me .
I do not like to leave bad reviews but this is the worst place i have been to .
The variety of dishes in ayce menu is average , no sashimi though .
The pieces were of a good bite size , not too big that does not fit in the mouth .
Not too much rice to fill you up fast either .
Service is not superb but is ok .
I will for sure be back soon and can not wait to tell my friends !
I was not able to finish my meal .
Was not impressed and will not return .
Took about an hour , so not bad .
They were so busy talking they could not even ask me to put my foot in the water , just shoved it in .
It was not that crowded so it was easy to find a spot .
We can not wait to stay next year !
Some of the rolls were not put well together , but there 's nothing wrong with the taste .
Having no clue as to what to expect ... i gleefully ordered a sapporo and hibachi salmon , while offspring ordered the hibachi shrimp .
And i was in no way prepared at the expected participation of catching a flipped broccoli in my mouth !
Their salsa bar is the best in the business with a variety of salsas that are all fantastic not to mention the spicy carrots and grilled onions .
You will not regret your visit to ricardo's .
Yep , it 's chè , and not che the argentine marxist revolutionary ( he probably did not drink too much bubble tea or pandan jelly drinks back in his day ) .
It was a light tasting drink that is good for someone that does not want something super sweet and is looking for more hydrating refreshment .
We have issues from dead trees not being removed , smoke alarms continuously going off and a crappy air conditioning !
On q is not worried about their renters just that they get paid !
Do not come here !
The lady doing my nails did not even say anything about the bugs so once i told her that there are ants all over the table and floor she cleaned them up .
I read some of the other reviews and i just do not the negativity .
Not really a fan .
Definitely not the same meat that 's pictured on their display .
I would not come back again .
I could not be happier with the efficiency and service and will never go anywhere else again for my appliances !
I do not think they worth over $ 50 per order .
Also the service was not good either .
Their prices have been hiked again and it is no longer worth the money they charge .
Shall miss the octogan and the great food they serve but i will not throw my money .
We called about resos & were told they would not take any for under 10 people .
I regret not taking a snap of it .
& no one , gas apologized for the delay .
Dropped by last saturday and there was no wait .
Looks fantastic , no complaints about service and was able to sit and watch tv while i waited .
They brought the truck around to the front and they informed me there was something they were not happy with and asked me to wait another 10 minutes while they corrected it .
Did not work , but supports that fact that they have a mind of their own .
I should have asked him to take some pics , maybe i will tomorrow after i get ready for work , i have slept on it since then , although it still looks great , it just does not reflect his technique .
You can really tell they take pride in their work and never have a second thought about coming here for more tint !
Not bad for $ 7 .
The chicken fried rice had a good portion but there was not much chicken in the rice ( see picture ) .
Did not care for the fried rice or veggies .
No seasoning at all !
I love hibachi so i would not recommend this place .
They offered us a new room , but we needed to leave the next day - thus , no good .
I felt like i needed to argue to get some kind of financial comp for an issue that was not our - this to the hotel manager , ashley .
I was left disappointed and would not recommend this hotel .
They had complementary earplugs available in the room which concerned me at first , however i did not have a need for them .
- no recommended at all !!!
I walk in got an bad welcome and got seated to wait since i did not have an appointment .
Ok with that since i did not have an appointment .
15 minutes after , a couple walk - in asking if they can be seen " no appointment either " few minutes after they got seated and a vietnamese guy start doing their pedicure , even though i got there 20 minutes before them .
Waited few minutes though to my self maybe the other girls will see me in few minutes but to my surprise i guess i had wait even longer and not been see right away for been a latino person .
I will not recommend this place to anyone , for the bad customer service and been racist .
I had never seen that at other salons .
Accompanied with garlic mashed potatoes , it does not get any better than this !
I know that does not sound good but trust me it taste yummy plus the milk teas is also pretty good too .
San tan location .. bad customer service , never return calls , spend over $ 4,000 there , but still no one cares to call back , including 2 messages to the manager , he does not care to return calls of customers either .. not going there again !!

Ordered the spicy sushi roll and it did not look fresh .
I have used this place as a caterer as well and they can not be beat .
I do not understand why people do not express to the technicians if they want something different done or do not like what they are doing wether it be a manicure or pedicure .
Do not think it 's fair to not to speak up and then turn around and give an unsatisfactory review .. really ?
She offered up a variety of their services , but really did not pressure me when i opted not to do anything but a pedi .
He did not replace the plate .
Do n't eat here !!!
Since i was there alone and portions are generous , i could not try a lot of menu items .
As i do not live close to this restaurant , unfortunately i will not be a regular customer ; however , i do want to come back and try some of the bbq dishes .
I 'd probably prefer the volcano over blue crab , but you can not go wrong with either .
My bowl did not seem to have the same amount of food as the other bowls , and she quickly resolved it by getting me more without charging .
Service is top notch in here , but the quality in my opinion is not there if you add all factors in ( ambiance , price , service ) the lack of choices for appetizers and mains , makes it a little hard to find something specific you might be in for .
I have visited it a couple of times , but it would not be something that i would repeat or recommend .
Their steaks are good , mediocre , but definitely not the best in the gta
I have tried the fillet , and the pepper corn steak , not bad but not the best .
I have been a regular customer of marija for waxing for the past 8 months or so , and i will never ever shave again , or go to a different salon .
Have not had a horrible dish but certainly prefer some dishes over others .
Things just could not have gone smoother .
It is close to the airport , but i did not hear the planes .
I never go out because nothing fast food is ever good .
We were not impressed and ate less than half of each .
And they do not list all ingredients on the menu .
I can not stand mayonnaise .
I was not worried about it since it was not on the menu .
We will not be rushing back .
It did not work after being installed !!!
( installer did not stay to check if worked properly ) .
Called to speak with manager ( wayne ) who said spencer 's would only repair it and not allow me to return it or even send me out a new one .
Wayne promised to call me tuesday after repairs were made and , of course , he never called .
As for wayne 's statement about " this is how the appliance business works " , i called 4 competitors to see what they would do in my scenario : costco - return to store within 90 days for full refund best buy - return to store within 15 days for full refund home depot - return to store within 48 hrs for new product or full refund sears - return to store within 60 days for new product of full refund spencer 's would not even stand by their product for 2 hours , let alone days / weeks like the above merchants would .
Spencer 's never even followed up once to see if the overall issue had been resolved .
Having been to locations in socal and vegas , i could not wait for this location to open after seeing the coming soon signs on my way to china magic noodle house .
It was my first time , but not hers . i definitely have been missing out though ! i can not remember the exact name of my sandwich but it was a sandwich with steak on ciabatta ( chicken is an option too ) .
We went about 11:30 am and it did not take long at all for our food to be served . i noticed a lot of pick up orders , so this seems to be a regular place for many individuals .
When i got there , the restaurant had 2 - 3 tables so they were not that busy .
The sushi chef took forever to get started even though i did not see him make any other rolls in the time i was waiting .
Finally , they packed up my food but did not give me a spoon for the soup .
They required us to miss work for the technician , who diagnosed the problem not worth fixing ( as the serial number on the machine is missing and he said this meant it likely ' fell off a truck ' if you catch my drift ) and recommended it be replaced .
Now , i am not an expert on dishwashers , but when the technician says it will cost $ 450 dollars to replace a pump on a cheap dishwasher w / several broken rollers for the racks , or $ 600 dollars to replace it with a german designed bosch dishwasher with a 5 year warranty and home depot / lowe 's happy to install it on saturdays for free and remove the old broken machine , what is the decision here ?
They are also unwilling to send a representative from their company to supervise maintenance during the week when we are not home ( we are not comfortable leaving a key , we have already had someone steal several items from a car left outside in the short month we have lived here . )
3 . they require professional cleaning of the house and pristine maintenance of the lawn but the house was not move in ready and the lawn was absolutely unkept ( sunburnt to oblivion ) .
How do they not know the mailbox number of a property they manage ?
5 . they have no authority whatsoever .
I thought that was the entire point of property management - so you do not have to deal with trivial matters such as dishwasher replacement .
I do not care how affordable this place is , you are getting exactly the quality that you are paying for .
This was so bad that my friend and i , huge fans of oysters , did not even finish our orders .
The " must - try " squid tentacles were overcooked and over - battered , making them not only chewy , but hard as well .
The only thing that had not been screwed up was the vegetable tempura , and i imagine you 'd have to be pretty hard - pressed to really mess up deep - fried vegetables .
I , however , will not be returning to find out .
The guy messed up on my nails and did not bother to fix it .
Do not come here .
She gave me long coffin nails and i thought she was just giving herself the room to work with the acrylics and really mold them so i did not say anything .
She clipped them down and i still can not type this because of how long the awful nails are .
She was super rude and telling me it could not be done .
Of course i told her it was fine i did not mind paying but if she was going to be rude i could just go someplace else .
I am leaving - paying for whatever half asses job she did and never coming back .
That was not my experience today .
If you are traveling to this city and do not feel like spending your time in a noisy , smoky , hectic casino hotel , and yet .... want to be treated like a valued customer despite not being there just to empty your bank account at their tables ?

I ordered a full rotisserie chicken and it was cooked perfectly , juicy and flavorful throughout , and the skin was perfect , also came conveniently quartered so no hassle serving .
We were not going in expecting anything but first of all : we had excellent customer service from the owner , she explained how they make the coconut milk fresh everyday and that all of the ingredients are not bagged and processed ( which is what you would get with normal halo halo ) and i loved knowing that the ingredients were fresh and not in a jar for who knows how long ?
We loved how refreshing they were and not too sweet to our tastebuds .
I have had irritation / reactions in the past and i left jane feeling no discomfort at all !
Plus , you are next door to smoothie king ... who does not need a post - wax smoothie !
I especially love their 2 most hottest hot sauce though . the corn casserole was not what i expected to be which was street corn style but i appreciate their unique twist & my 10 month babyboy sure liked it .
Been in clt my whole life & never came to what it was before .
I do not know if i should be ashamed or that 's common .
I noticed there was something here but for no reason at all i just never experienced it .
I sure do not regret giving this a try though & i am glad coaltrane is here now .
As long as there are no repairs at home this company works fine .
They do not provide second option .
Also when my home kept in the market , there were issues like , prospective tenants could not open the number lock .
Read good reviews , but when we pulled up - it had a drive through - not what i was expecting .
I really like from here : avocado salad , seaweed salad , vegetable and salmon soup , rock n' roll shrimp , grilled salmon , pretty much all the rolls , and some more that i can not remember .
Secondly , when you pay with credit card or debit , the machine asks you if you want to add a tip , sort of encouraging you to tip twice if you do not read the bill carefully and realize that the tip is already included in the total price .
My friend and i both made this mistake , because the waitress simply quoted a tip - inclusive price verbally as she brought our bills and punched in payment prices on her machine , so we had not even had a chance to look at the bill .
They had no reason at all to not refund us .
After almost getting into an argument with them , they grudgingly gave us the money back and did not seem happy at all !
The boys there know their stuff , and they are unapologetic about not being there to entertain you .
Do not pass up the opportunity .
Always perfect and the only downside is it is so good you have to be very careful not to kill your appetite ahead of the meal .
I also got a vietnamese coffee which i like , better than starbucks lol no bitter after taste , strong yet sweet .
The only thing is do not stop by in a lunch break because it takes a little longer than most places , but we do not mind since it was good !
You can not beat the quality and price .
Although i thought my wants for my hair were very specific , it seems that i was not using the right terminology or i did not understand what she meant as we were discussing my hair . overall though , the color is good and the cut is the best i have had in a long time .
I have been to other places too and never had a better quality of work done on my nails than at lotus .
Best of all , no crazy acetone or acrylic fumes ( which is a huge deal breaker for me at other " cheaper " places !
I can not enjoy the experience if i am leaving with a migraine ) .
Minus 1 star for rarely listening to my request to leave my nails longer ( shaped , not cut down ) .
Not to mention he was very rushed and rough with my nails .
I did not experience the breakfast , pool area , or shuttle , or anything else except concierge for show discounts .
They did not deny my observation .
Each room was as clean as clean as can be . the beds were pretty comfy , and i liked the pillows , cos they were firm and had substance , not like the feather ones that smash into nothingness .
She did not read that it was documented i was given till 11 am , she said , " sorry about that " .
Do not stay in units on each floor from 16 a - 20 . e.g 116 a- 120 , 216a- 220 . 316 a-320 , cos the hall ac vibrates the walls for those rooms .
2 . my check in desk clerk told me specifically that not only local calls were free , but calls to other states were free , like a cell phone .
By that time another clerk told me calls to other states were not free , and the girl who told me they were free , was new . also another desk clerk showed me on the map that there was another elevator in mid building to my room , but it was untrue , only 1 elevator in the front .
So i said desk staff was not thoroughly trained .
Also hot is on the right not the left , of the one - handle shower valve .
5 . not enough light where the table and chairs are , this varies with the room .
I was shocked , and could not find the building because i was not expecting something so old looking , the color of the building was from the 50's , light sea green .
I may stay here again if it is as cheap as a yelper said , $ 47 , but will not book through rci .
Unfortunately i did not have space left for desert , their creme brulee looked delicious , so hopefully next time :)
Delivery and installation are reasonably priced , although i personally think every place should deliver and install as a part of he price , so i can not drop a star here .
That being said , it has not been a great experience most the time .
I have vowed not to return on several occasions .
There is one technician who is obviously not thrilled with her job .
And i can not even tell you how many times i have watched her answer her cell phone and yell and cuss at whoever is on the other end ..... in the middle of doing someone 's nails !!
9 th. ( today is the 25th , so it 's been 16 days ) the tech , who i had never seen before , cut me a few times while cutting back my cuticle on my toes .
This is not a big deal ... it happens from time to time .
The problem does not come til she puts her gloves on and starts applying the callous remover gel .
However today , ( 11 march 2018 ) it was quite busy , and the service staff was not quite as attentive .
The pork congee did not taste as appetizing as our previous visits .
Even when i paid the bill , left a generous tip , the waiter just took it and never said a word .
I love hibatchi , but sadly sumo did not live up to my expectations .
Our chef cooked all the proteins at the same time , and was not quick enough to avoid overdoing the shrimp and calamari .
I have never seen a hibatchi chef start all proteins at the same time , and now i understand why .
To us , sumo was just not worth the 30 minute car ride to eat dinner there .
I was nervous to go to a new salon and a new stylist but james worked his magic and i have not loved my hair color like this in literally years !
I had an appointment at 630 sat there for 30 mins waiting this lady comes in sits for 10 mins does not have an appointment and gets service i do not want to say they racist but i feel like they are !
Generally , i stick to fish , but for those who are not fish lovers there are some nice soups and your typical tempura and meat dishes . for lunch , the price for ayce is $ 13 , which is tremendous value as far as sushi is concerned .
Yes , there are a few items obviously missing , do not expect tuna sashimi or a lot of sashimi for that matter or large shrimp nigiri .
Mind you they do have some shrimp , tuna and some eel makis , which a lot of the ayce 's do not even offer .
But for a nice , laid back lunch , you simply can not go wrong here . although i still consider aji sai on the low - end price - wise on the sushi totem pole , along generation sushi and sushi on bloor ( meh ) , i do feel like they are trying to strive for something a bit better .
No one is going to call this place a full fledged authentic cuisine , it is not , it is however a tasty japanese simile which is worth having again and again ... and for $ 13 it 's great value and at a fraction of what you would pay if you went to an authentic japanese restaurant .
Also , i think the place is run by chinese , not japanese , if that matters to you .
Quick , easy , no hassle , delicious !
Never dissapointed !
Next we had a fried mozzarella piece in panko ... not seasoned at all .
I have never sent back a drink ... ever. we also ordered seasonal vegetables ... sliced undercooked carrots ... really ???
Please do not waste your time .
Finally , that lemon walnut dressing is causing me problems because i can not get it now that i have left pittsburgh .
The entree included combo veggies of carrots , zucchini and onions which would have been great if they were not swimming in teriyaki sauce .
Did not smile .
All in all if i go back , perhaps to try their sashimi or sushi , i would not order hibachi unless i was sitting at the the hibachi table where i could tell them not to add sauce to my food .
I thought food should be marinated in teriyaki not swimming in it in the finished dish .
We have been waiting 37 minutes and counting with not much going on in the restaurant .
Ps i was in food service for 10 years , so i promise i am not just an " i wan na speak to your manager " type .
When our food came , the eggs looked like they had been sitting for a while , and the bacon was not cooked all the way , even though we both specifically asked for well - done bacon .
There was no hot syrup , so i asked the waitress again , and she said she 'd bring it .
After about 10 minutes , i got up , because i saw the waitress , and she looked like she had no intentions whatsoever of bringing the syrup .
I went over and asked another waitress if we could get some hot syrup , and she said , " we do not do hot syrup . " she then looked at our waitress and said , " we do not do hot syrup anymore . " our waitress just shrugged her shoulders and turned around , so i spoke to the manager who was nearby .
I went over and asked another waitress if we could get some hot syrup , and she said , " we do not do hot syrup . " she then looked at our waitress and said , " we do not do hot syrup anymore . " our waitress just shrugged her shoulders and turned around , so i spoke to the manager who was nearby .
She explained that someone , maybe an employee , had burned themself once before , so no more hot syrup .
Why not just say when she took our order that they do not do that , and my wife would have just ordered something else ?
Do not they serve hot coffee ?
I do not think i will be eating syrup that 's been sitting open in a bowl , under a light , for 10 ?
At the time of purchase kent stated " an email confirming delivery is on its way " i still have not gotten that email .
I can neither verify or deny if there was a discount because this was done over the phone and not at the time of my original purchase .
No service recovery offered by spencer 's except to deliver the correct dryer two days later kent did say he was " not going to charge me an additional delivery fee " .
I was supposed to get a call this am ... that did not happen either .
Again no offer for service recovery .
At 12:15 i called to speak with the spencer 's store manager larry , because i still had not gotten my delivery larry was tied up .
He offered to double my dryer warranty from one year to 2 years at no charge , to make amends for the dryer issue .
1:15 tech still not at my house but he did call .
He cleaned up all of the mess and left no trace of any work done .
This time larry was curt , less than helpful and actually hung up while i was mid sentence trying to explain there were no hard feelings to him . bottom line : spencer 's customer service is the worst i have ever encountered .
I have to admit that i was mostly curious because of the " bacon " aspect , and it was not all that prevalent in the dish , but there was plenty of chicken , noodles , and veggies and it was all very good .
Spicy - wise , it had a little bit of kick , but not overwhelming .
It was a good amount of food , and i was not leaving with a greasy gut - bomb feeling that was going to put me in a food coma going back to work .
There was not a ton of seating outside it 's a little crammed and you are kind of tucked away so there is no view or action but it 's a good place to check out .
Drink orders were taken promptly and overall service was good ( minus one thing that we will get to ) ; my boyfriend 's soda never went more than half empty , finished dishes were cleared quickly , and even little things like my straw paper were whisked away within a minute of placing it on the end of the table .
I did not sample the crab rangoon , but they did look perfectly fried and the filling had some fresh herbs .
My boyfriend had me try the dipping sauce , which he liked , but i did not care for it .
I tried one bite of the sweet potato , but there was no discernible seasoning and the thickness of the cut made it a little more firm than i prefer .
I would have asked for some , but once our entrees were delivered we did not see our server again until we had been sitting for ten minutes and barely touching our plates .
And here we come back to the service point i mentioned - i was not asked if i enjoyed my food and no comment was made that i really had not eaten anything .
My boyfriend and i had already discussed that we would not have asked to send it back since we did get what we asked for , and it was what the menu said ; we just had different expectations that it would be a more balanced entree with some lighter / fresher elements rather than a jumbo pile of fried breading .
I obviously can not comment about their selection or service in - store , but i was happy with my experience on a 100 % remote transaction !
Highlight recommend bluffing is not nice by bad beat brewing .
I hate to give this place a 2 star review based on some things that are not their fault but the truth of the matter is that i have had better accommodations elsewhere and at other hamptons .
It gets so bad that the windows shake at times and if you are a light sleeper then you probably are not sleeping .
Anyhow , the staff is really nice and the breakfast is not bad at all .
Not so much .
I also really liked the diet pop -- they do not carry pepsi/coke .
It 's a less common more organic brand -- it had some type of natural sweetener which was not stevia .
I did not have room for the honeybar but i am dying to try that next time !
One of the staff booked the flight in a friendly manner but did not actually write it down .
By the time i was waiting downstairs there was no evidence of a shuttle having been booked .
This by itself would not have merited a 2 star review but the lady working the desk on a sunday night did not so much as apologize .
She just acted like it was not her fault and did not know what happened .
I had a polite conversation suggesting that such an attitude led to a poor customer experience but she acted as if she could not care less .
Have not tried any of the other stuff so this review is solely based on the salad i had .
I asked them to wait to start my pedicure as my girlfriend was a few min late , not only did they disregard my request to have our pedicures together , but they defended this decision , saying they had a lot of people to serve and had to keep things moving .
Moreover , what they have advertised on their website did not match the pedi offerings in their on site menu and when i pointed this out , they again took no ownership and blamed me for not reading the menu on site .
In today 's world , i can not imagine defending incorrect or outdated info on your website when that is the primary way people find your business .
That did not matter to us too much since we were not in the market for a tv , but with just about 10 tvs on display , i would not say this is the best place to go for variety .
When searching for new digs , it does not get much worse than a property management company that never responds , despite your multiple communication efforts , persistence and patience .
It shuts off trying to start and will not dispense soap .
Goldwing calls at 8:30 am and says they will be here 3 - 5 pm ... i said i would like it in the morning ... they say they have no control over the days schedule ... now is has been scheduled 3 weeks ago ..... this is the 4th attempt to fix it .
I call whirlpool and what a coinidenece .. they do not find any service records of the other 3 times here .
They say they have no control over goldwings scheduling .
Of course they say not .
I was told by my son not to use spencers as he had a bad experience with a fridge he bought from them .
I would never go to spencers again .
Unfortunately i am stuck with this piece of crap washer now ... unless i play the discount tire lady and return it to them ... do not use spencers
No , they do not skimp here , not at all .
Maybe it was because unlike some other places , they did not insist on filling 95 % of the burrito with the stuff , so it was more of a compliment than a main event .
I can not wait to go back for a haircut .
Did not like the clueless staff , rude shuttle driver and bad internet access .
No excuse for wifi issues this day and age .
She then denied my card and said " no , cash " .
I have never been so offended .
Would not go back .
Great job and no , not 1 bubble !
Service was only a couple of hours and not all day like past experiences .
I drove back there to retrieve it ( no discount for my troubles ) and was not even pleased with their version of a tres leche .
I called them on 2/12/15 and they said that they could not get anyone out on 2/13 and that it would have to be 2/14 , and that someone would call me by 8:30 on 2/14 and give me a two hour window for that day .
2 / 14 comes and no call by 8:30 .
No one came by .
No one .
No doorbell , no nothin'. they lied .
So she said someone will call me sometime during the day , so i still have no idea what time they are coming , or even if .
No one has called yet .
So now i sit , on a saturday , living out of a cooler , with a 2 - year old fridge that is dead , with absolutely no help from the manufacturer , distributor , or service provider , all of which asked straight away if i had a service contract , sure enough , but not if they can provide anything remotely resembling service .
Stay away from whirlpool , spencer 's and gold wing ... i gave everyone one star because i had to ... if i could i would give them no stars , and even that would be generous .
However i was not really impressed by the che i had .
Overall i give this place a 3.5 just because i really did not enjoy the smell of this place when i first walked in .
I also did not like that the menu was blinking and going blank then coming back on , especially when your trying to order .
Been there a few times and the experience with my nails is decent but today i kept telling the lady i did not like the shape or color and she added the gel without my consent and decided to charge me more for the crappy nail shape she did when before i never got charged $ 40 for plain nail if i had a design maybe but this was plane ass .
Hate my nails do not know why i paid i just did not want to be there anymore but i am going back to complain and demand they fix them .
I do not write reviews but just thought i 'd do it for this one since it was over hyped .
Good thing i do not get sweeteners for my teas because it was extremely sweet .
While not great but better than what anyone else has to offer .
Can not say enough great things about this pseudo island getaway ( reminds me of key west ) .
I did not want to go thinking it would not be worth my time .
No complaints
The hashbrown burrito not only satisfied my craving for a breakfast burrito , it exceeded my expectations !
Found this place on yelp ... it did not disappoint !
Thank heavens they made a bloody mary for me , i do not drink all that often but kinda wanted one all day to drown out this migraine .
They do not care for your property , they overcharge for the work they do have completed if they ever get around to fixing things .
I personally prefer no more than 2 weeks though because i have fast nail growth , but the polish does not lift prematurely .
All in all , not a place you 'd go to feel absolutely pampered , but they are friendly and do a nice job !
They may not be fluent in english but they can atleast be courteous and polite and greet with a smile .
Although the food is decent , the attitude of the staff compells me to not recommend this location .
They did not have it .
Now the dishwasher is not attached properly .
He never called back .
He never called .
If they were not going to send someone out the second time , why did not they just say so , instead of lying ?
I would never deal with this company again , nor would i recommend it , to anyone .
Not only did the order take 45 minutes but it was literally served to other folks across from us .
Thankfully it did not go unnoticed .
I was not given the option to have a whole new badge of food made instead i had to ask .
My only problem is i feel seating is not that great , but they are doing their best with the building 's size .
Their selection is pretty decent , i have never received late or cold food and i have always enjoyed what i ordered .
I would not let that bother you tbh .
I can not believe i even agreed to pay $ 45 for it .
First , he was going so fast in an attempt to just get onto the next customer that as he was filing my nails , he sliced my finger open and fixed it with basically super glue with no warning .
Not generally what i am used to when getting a mani .
My nails are all different lengths and not consistent at all .
He scraped his hand against one of my fingers while applying the top coat and did not fix it so now i have a smeared nail .
The acrylic does not even cover my entire nails so the sides are just open messes of extensions , glue , and poorly prepped natural nail .
I will never be returning to this location .
The congee was very good with an abundance of different toppings like roast duck , lettuce , green onions , squid , peanuts , and some pig skin ( which i do not particularly enjoy , but i am sure it might suit some people 's taste buds ) .
We ordered dough fritters to go with the congee and were surprised that it was made fresh ( perhaps it was because we came early and they had not had the chance to make any yet ) .
We did not know it was not todd english anymore .
Never again !!!
No housekeeping for the 5 days we have stayed there .
I did not have an opportunity to sleep on one because i am the youngest and i sacrificed the older ones to have the beds .
:od to bad they can not change the look / feel / comfort of this place .
The server was amazing but the surroundings was not .
Definetly worth going back to again and certainly not a hole in the wall .
It s not the fact that i had to pay , it s the attitude and lack of customer service
My very picky boyfriend who does not typically like vietnamese dessert even liked this drink .
I was a vegas virgin at this point and had no idea where this was in location to the strip .
But that did not really matter as this place was so great we hardly left !
It was not very crowded so getting a spot at the pool based on where the sun was , was very easy ( read ... we moved when the sun shifted ) .
However ... no liqour stores !!!!
I am glad the front desk person advised us not to connect to the paid room wifi service company mentioned in their property book because the service is very unreliable .
With no room high speed internet service my directtv hbo togo service or any togo tv service does not work .
In the living room there are 2 large round vents that can not be adjusted .
We clipped a face towel to the vent using 2 office alligator paperclips to deflect the air stream toward the floor , since the vents do not move .
I did not see the fruit mentioned by some others .
Note that only 3 veggie add - in options are included , and beyond that you have to pay extra ( which can add up quick .... although today i did not care and went for the veggie overload ! ) my food was ready in about 5 minutes , and i was a happy camper .
The portion was very generous , and they did not skimp on any of the add-ins .
I loved the sesame garlic sauce ... it had great flavor and it was not too oily , which stir - fry sauces can sometimes be .
It is kinda pricey ( especially if you add a bunch of stuff in like i did ) , but i was happy with the quality , so it does not seem too excessive .
Not worth the money .
We will not be back .
Oh and btw , the terrace bar upstairs which supposedly had views of the city i guess meant views of plaza midwood since i could not see uptown at all .
This place has absolutely no concept or understanding of customer service .
This place is horrible - but the sushi is not that bad .
It was pretty disgusting and i love crab - just not this one .
I really can not deal with the servers at this place because they are too rude , so i will not be back .
Do not go .
They do not clean properly and inspect their equipment .
They use plastic bags over the bowls so they do not have to disinfect .
I drove myself to the er. they did not even call an ambulance or even offer .
Would not even give it a 1 star .
Spencer's has something at every price point and source the hard to fit or find items that other retailers can not .
Not impressed with this particular hampton inn. we are rewards members and predominantly stay at hampton inns .
If you stay here ask for rooms that do not face the runway .
The remote control in the room did not operate the television .
When we called down to the front desk they sent another one up to the room and it did not work the television either .
We like hampton inns but not this one in particular .
It was not until she started scrubbing my feet , that i noticed they do not use sterilized tools .
I did not care for the sauces .
No desire to go back !!!
They were not sincere nor seemed very concerned about the issue .
Normally a representative would meet at the house to do the walk through together , however the company said that no one was available to do that .
The company and owners stated that i left the house in a horrible condition , they had to replace the wall plaster left from curtains that were hung ( the curtains were hung with command hooks that stick to the wall , no holes were drilled ) , there were large holes drilled into the roof for a directv dish ( i had permission from the owner before moving in that i could install the dish ) , and that the front door lock was broken and needed to be replaced .
It was also stated that a door slat was broken on the lower floor , it was not .
I called and asked to see the receipts from the work that was done on the home and they stated that they did not have receipts , they just billed me for what it was the usual " going rate " for someone to fix these items .
He told me that there was nothing he could do and that i should be happy that they even let me out of the lease in the first place because they did not have to ( and that i really needed to let it go on what they charged me and just walk away ) .
I could not believe this .
I was desperate to leave with my son and i knew i was being taken advantage of because i did not leave the house this way .
My attorney sent a letter to on q within a couple days stating that they had to send the rest of my security deposit over immediately due to no proof / receipts of " work " and that they simply had lied and took all of my money when they really did not do what they had charged me for .
Seriously , do not do business with this company .
They do not have your best interest , they only want your money and will find anyway to take advantage of you if given the opportunity .
Make an appointment with mark ..... you will not regret it .
I was not a fan of it but , no complaints really since it 's complimentary .
The coffee was not the greatest but had caffeine which is all that mattered to me .
Again , it 's complimentary , it 's not designed to satisfy your morning appetite , much less your palate , but , it will get you through the morning .
You do not hear the planes landing as much as you hear and feel the thunder of the planes taking off .
No kidding !
We asked the front desk agent the next morning , who btw was not all that pleasant , but seemed like she had a scripted answer to the ever popular question .
We were unpacked anyway and did not want to move so we just went to cvs and bought ear plugs , which did help .
I have a feeling if you got an even number room , facing the front , the noise is not as significant .
Not sure why the front desk agent was not so proactive in trying to make us happy , the hotel was not full or anything the whole time we were there .
He knows just how to cut this girls curls ... how i love this mans work , never does he upset .
No coordination and no follow through .
Not one month did everything go smooth .
I was a fool and and idiot not to have fired them the first month i used them .
No questions , just wanted approval for a new water heater .
What they did not know and did not ask , was that it was brand new , only 2 weeks old and never used .
I just hope you people reading this understand that i have never done a review on anything before .
They sent their company out , who did not give me a report , but charged me $ 87 to tell me that my entire system needed to be replaced , for a total of over $ 7000 .
Based on the e-mail communication alone , my understanding is that you are not satisfied with how things have gone recently .
Correct me if i am wrong , but i do not believe we will see eye - to - eye on what needs to happen with this air conditioner .
That said , i do not hold it against you that you disagree with what our stance is .
You feel like we have not held up our end of the deal and in turn , are now demanding $ 250 .
And if we do not pay , you will sue us and write nasty reviews online .
Getting into the nitty gritty of responding to the reviews , fighting back and forth , and so on will not get us anywhere .
All the film was cut by a computer , so there are no wavy lines or weird placements like other shops .
I have used other tint shops in the past , but the price and service at auto tint express can not be beat .
Ever since that day i have been sold , i will never put wax on my face again !!!
I will not go any where else to get threaded in charlotte !!
If they were not in dilworth i would still make the trek to whitehall !!
I have had to wait a little longer than i 'd like when i land for the shuttle to pick me up , but it s never been unreasonable .
I also feel like it s a much safer parking lot than some of the other hotels near mccarran and i am never worried about leaving my car there for a long period of time .
Well the other guests had not even boarded the shuttle yet so i am not sure why i was asked to wait and take a later shuttle and almost miss my flight !
I highly recommend everyone who needs their vehicle tinted these guys are dedicated to there work and have wonderful customer service , you will not be disappointed thank you auto tint express i will definitely be back !!
This place has not been open for long , but has already become one of my favorites .
I do not normally like soups , but i thoroughly enjoyed theirs .
When he told me i was like , oh ok , no wonder you are so good !
I do not live in toronto or canada for that matter but every time i come to visit , congee queen is on my list of places to eat !
Mine did not come with a side , but my coworker thought his quinoa with vegetables was too garlicky , so he let me try it .
I love garlic , but i could not eat it because it had so much garlic in it that you could not taste anything else .
I like the ambience here , it s updated with modern furnishings and i ve never had to wait for seating which is a plus .
No pressure sales , the guy just treated us like family .
Austin has been great at explaining processes along the way so that we not only feel more comfortable with the process but learn for the future .
My family is a big fan of pei wei , so decided to try wok box as an alternative for take out ..... not a good experience .
Their " large " portion actually come in a small box and the dish is mixed with the rice , which means by the time you get home it s mostly a soggy mess and there is no recognizable sauce left ...
I love that i can come in and chat the whole time i am getting my nails done and not just sit in silence .
Our car was robbed in the tahiti parking lot .. at 2 am ... no staff warned us at check in ... we left 3 bags in our vehicle as it was raining in vegas ?
We spent the night getting a new car ... no sleep spoke to manager on duty in the am ... they know they have a problem , yet they have no cameras in parking area ... the night staff could not even give me the number to the police ... stay away
It 's not something you can get most places and it 's heavenly .
Can not wait to see this business grow !!
The salsas are typical cheap bottled , mass produced tasting , and sadly no pico available at the salsa bar , but i rarely find myself wishing for it here anyways .
Never again .
I do not know if they upgraded our room or what but it was beautiful .
The television could not be heard .
This was not just noise it was unsleepable noise .
No sleep but the night is free .
Only it was not .
The prepaid room was not only not comped but it was double billed with an extra $ 50 incidentals charge .
Hilton promises to resolve the situation but i did not need the stress of finding $ 350 in unexpected charges in my bill and not finding my refund .
The refund still is not showing .
I will not be staying there again .
I will not go back to this place nor do i recommend it .
The people are very nice do not get wrong .
I get suckered into choosing a more expensive pedicure package bc i think i am saving some money but i am not .
It actually never looked good .
I would not recommend this place to anyone .
I am not going to go to the bank just to tip you in cash !!
So many amazing and delicious restaurants in vegas - but this is absolutely not one of them .
Do not make the same mistake as us .
They are not even trying or care .
Even though tables are empty and are not reserved .
Do yourself a favor and do not waste your time or money .
I stay in hampton s a lot . this one is not up to par . the shuttle never arrived after an hour .

No one cared .
It 's in a warehouse area and does not feel very safe .
We have had very bad experiences with our previous property management companies ( most recently renter 's warehouse ... do not ever , ever , ever list your property with them !! ) .
So we were hesitant to dive back into the rental market again , but really had no choice .
I was encouraged to find that they provide you with an actual name of someone to contact about your property once it is rented ( not just a phone number that may or may not have someone working it that day ) .
I know that does not sound like much , but after our ordeal with renter 's warehouse , finding a company that actually does what they say they are going to do was extremely comforting .
Not only did it happen quickly , but i received the rent that i was asking for and made no major changes to the property .
We could not have asked for a better experience thus far .
Perfect amount of spice , not too overpowering .
We always enjoy dinner at the octogon and this visit was no exception .
Not to be missed is the caesar salad made from scratch table side and the steaks ... my filet was cooked perfectly and excellent quality as always .
Excellent wine list with many selections that you will not find at your local lcbo .
When the workers are not very apologetic and friendly it makes it even worse .
When we came in they were not very friendly .
Getting our food did not take very long .
I asked for sour cream but there was a misunderstanding because i was not given any .
They acted like it was not a big deal .
Watched a sporting event on tv that was not live .
You can not help but feel relaxed , sitting in the large massage chair , sipping a glass of wine and looking around the beautifully decorated salon .
My feet have not felt , or looked , this good in a long time !
Other than that , no complaints .
It was not that busy ... a few tables finishing up as we were parkin out butts in the booth .
We only ordered the standard grand slams so it 's not like anything had a long cook time .
Not served in togo containers lol .
You do not have to give your order to a person at the register who has to wait for you to make up your mind as you go back and forth with choosing what ingredients to use while a line of people are waiting for you .
Instead , there are multiple touch pads so no one really has to wait to start ordering .
Instead we were welcomed with burnt out lightbulbs , garage openers that did not work , garbage disposal that did not work , paint debris left all over the house , and filthy uncleaned carpet .
Upon move out it was difficult to get response from the leasing manager ( who " had no idea " of these things from move in ) .
( i am extremely picky and hard to please when it comes to my hair b/c of so many bad experiences ) but i could not stop smiling when i left and have not stopped two weeks later !
It contained an abundance of sweet ingredients , many of which i have never tried before : longan , jackfruit , and pandan jelly .
At first , i could not tell if it was a drink or a dessert eaten from a cup .
The fruit are sliced in generous pieces so getting them through a straw is not an option .
Do not forget to grab a spoon when you order one of these !
I usually feel bloated from drinking dense , creamy boba teas , but this ché did not do that .
I know a couple people have commented on their wait time at the salon , but honestly it does not bother me .
Sometimes timing is not an exact science .
I stay in hampton s a lot . this one is not up to par . the shuttle never arrived after an hour .
I stay in hampton s a lot . this one is not up to par . the shuttle never arrived after an hour .
No one cared .
It 's in a warehouse area and does not feel very safe .
When i went to redeem it , they said it did not count for anything we bought .
Do not use their " free " gift certificates you get in the mail .
I personally have not been here , but my sister and her friend we nt here last night .
As you can see in the attached photos , the salon owner ( she believes his name is denny , but it may be danny ) , either does not know where a cuticle ends and a finger begins or simply does not care - both which make him not only unqualified to own a nail salon , but even more so to do nails .
Obviously , my sister and her friend displayed a level of annoyance , as i am sure many would do in a situation that they were in - where someone providing a service does not take responsibility .
I can only imagine this would have happened because he did not think he would have gotten a tip - which at least he would have been knowledgeable enough to read the room and understand that .
Do your nails at home or go to a reputable business , that stands by the pricing displayed & that does not injure their customers ( and the people who keep them in business ) " sometimes " , and when they do injure or do wrong to their patrons , they promptly fix it .
The food is quite good , but not better than other local places to make me come back to this very cheaply run , price gouging spot .
The lighting was well done so the technicians have light to see , but is not overly bright for customers .
Relaxing music is piped through the salon at an appropriate level to be heard , but not infringe on conversation .
My only criticism is that my technician did not appear to speak english and so her communication with me happened through another employee .
I was also told that if i saw a cheaper price on anything i purchased elsewhere within 30 days to let them know and i would receive the difference back - if i had never been told this i would not be unhappy with my spencer experience right now .
Items are adequate and while i received a " deal " it was in no way a low cost purchase .
I saw the mattress on sale elsewhere for $ 400 less but when i called the store i spoke with someone ( not my original salesperson ) that informed me that the cost of the range and microwave come off as a discount on the mattress so i did not really pay $ 3899.00 for it .
My deal was not a deal but a way to manipulate numbers to make me feel that spencer 's was giving me something i could not get anywhere else .
Guy on the phone was pretty quick with his explanation on the pricing manipulation so i think i am not the 1st customer that has made that call .
Not really sure i would go back update :
Each time store manager , mr. flake ( aptly named ) said it was out of their hands and they could not help us !
Finally , if you are a kfyi listener , contact them and let them know they are advertising for a valley company that does not stand behind their sales !
Company only cares about selling , can not and will not supply customer service !
Again , if you do not believe me go ahead and waste your time and money at this store !
We were clients for 3 years and they never did their job , followed up or returned calls on time , when we decided to end our contract they did not communicate nor explain the process and they tried to force us to use their maintenance company who did not do their job , even after we paid for it .
Heard a lot about this steakhouse and we knew it was not cheap either ... never the less , we decided to go there yesterday to celebrate my birthday .
The service at first was nice , and then as we were about to finish our food , not quite finished , they already started pushing us to finish and started taking all our plates away , we had to literally tell them " we are still working on this ... " so as they stopped taking our plates away , and they immediately handed us the bill ...
We were not even done eating !
After handing us the bill , they came to the table every 30 seconds to see if we are ready to pay ... my wife had to tell the waiter " please do not check on the bill for at least 20 min ... we are not done yet . "
My wife has a fillet of sol and it was ok , but not great .
All in all we will probably never come back here nor will we recommend it to any of our friends .
Some vegetable spring rolls which i liked and she did not because they were deep fried but cold inside .
My wife had these sumo deluxe and it was delicious she said she had all chicken and i thought it was ok but i am not a chicken person you can get chicken all day long ... service was fast restaurant was decorated nicely and clean so
We stayed here 3 nights , and even tough the airport is across the street , we did not hear any planes !
We did not even have to use the free supplied earplugs !
Staff was helpful - always gave us free water when we asked , the free breakfast spread was huge and we had no issues with check in , or out .
Being at a chinese restaurant , you are expected to flag down any servers instead of having someone check on you every once in a while - not really an issue , however the restaurant is a bit on the big side and servers tend to congregate around the cashier area , so people sat at the corners and sides tend to have a hard time flagging down servers for ordering and getting the bill .
Just do not expect anything mind - blowing .
To start off if you need a home to be " managed " by a property management company , you can not find a worst one than this one .
You can call the office 5 times in a row and not get an answer .
I do not think these people do anything but collect fees from their customers and find where they can collect additional funds or deposits from tenants .
We also had a broken ice machine and ro water filtration system that did not work .
After they sent a repair guy out who stated " he could not fix it " those were problems we lived with for the next 11 months .
Onq from there could not even respond to us to try to fix it further .
Not to mention in the pictures i posted , half these items are documented in pictures that onq used to sell us on the house , and are still currently using to sell new renters the house .
... also with four girls in their early 20's living in the home i promise not one of us had any business changing a tire .
I can fight for what 's right but i can not change a tire .
It 's just super assuring working with a company that even the director can not put words to their lack of accountability .
We are being charged for things that the owner had left and did not want removed from the home .
As after we called he came by and took some trash away but very clearly left what he did not consider trash .
In short , do not rent a property managed by this company or let them manage it as an owner .
As they can not even answer their phone to take on any new business that may present itself .
We have been very pleased with our appliances , and have shopped at spencer 's for years ; we 'd never go anywhere else !
From that we confirmed that many people do not look in a mirror before going out in public .
Overall a fine lunch but nothing i could not get at home or applebee 's
The taste of the food is delicious , the tropical burrito i got was fresh and had no fishy smell and the fish taco was crispy and tender at the center .
It 's not really a place for fancy service or what not and i believe consistency would serve them well , based on some negative reviews .
We arrived at 10 am which is opening time and watched the staff sit around for an additional 15 minutes before unlocking the front door upon which the manager welcomed us with " you can come in now " - no apology to the group of people that were waiting outside .
Since it took 45 minutes to hit the table we excepted more .... will not be back .
The carnitas street tacos were dry , hard and so tough i could not chew them .
I said never mind just give me a refund and a lost customer .
I did not care for the enchilada , it was somewhat soggy and lacked taste .
The shells were crispy on the outside but soft enough to not fall apart .
The shredded beef was moist , tender , and seasoned as to not overpower the toppings of lettuce , cheddar cheese , and tomato .
Could not get a hold of anyone at first then when we put in app and paid a fee they gladly took the money and fee but said the house already had an application on it .
This is just a gross place .. do not use them !!!!
Between " meh " sushi , slow , grumpy service , and the fact that you receive about a quarter of the items you order from their all - you - can - eat menu , i do not understand why anyone bothers with this place .
Cozy , quiet and uncrowded at 6 on a saturday , we got the food pretty quickly and i could not be happier .
I felt the portion sizes were small for the price but not unreasonable .
It 's not going to satisfy a purist but that 's not the aim .
You offer a vegan cheese ( server did not know it was vegan but it said so on the menu ) but you do not offer a vegan bun or any alternative form of bread you may have .
$ 5 for the frozen looking peas and carrots that were terrible and i did not even eat .
To the restaurant , find a bun and do not charge $ 21 for the impossible burger that sells at whole foods for $ 6 for a package of 2 with no bun , a few onions , slice of tomato and piece of cheese and oh yeah , a lettuce leaf .
No thank you .
Save your time and money , do not eat here .
Would not recommend !
There is no communication .
I guess our landlord is not willing to fix anything !
Renters have no friends !!!
I work 24 / 7 and there is not a day that ends without a follow up to all my text 's and emails .
Open for lunch too , but not as busy as it is at night - reserve ahead .
We ordered a dozen dishes , here are the ones i remember : - ho fun ( delicious ) - shrimp wonton noodle soup ( all shrimp & noodles were cooked perfectly , a+ in my books ) - sautéed lobster ( good flavor , not the easiest to eat ) - pineapple fried rice ( my mom did not like this , others were content ) - gulu chicken ( did not try , people said good things ) - fried fish ( great flavor & super - crispy , non- greasy breading ) - beef w/ gai lan ( the gai lan tasted amazing , others said beef was good ) - dou miao ( delicious & tender )
The guys were super meticulous bringing the new appliances into the house , carefully removing our front door , and making sure they did not damage anything as they wheeled them into the kitchen .
Not returning phone calls or e mails for days and weeks .
Just a matter of time before they are no longer in business with this type of poor customer service .
There is no communication .
I guess our landlord is not willing to fix anything !
I have never had such a bad experience dining in a restaurant as i have with this steakhouse .
At the end of the meal they put the cheque as a single one , which was not really an issue since we expected that , but we also noticed a $ 300 surcharge on top of an already $ 1000 bill !!
We asked why they put that there and they said that because some of the party members did not show up they had to " make up for the lost profit for the scheduled staff and the room we put aside for the party .
Their reasoning is also a load of bs because they put their business expectations on the customer rather than anticipating that maybe some people do not show up when there is a party like other normal and decent restaurants do .
Now , they put this on the bill and did not mention this the first time when we called them to reserve for the party , nor the second time we called to tell them that there would be less people coming .
They did not have this policy on their website either and the bill had the number 15 printed on the bottom for the number of people .
Had this not happened i would have rated the restaurant much higher because the food was actually decent ( though really not worth the price in my opinion ) .
However , the trick with the $ 300 was such an underhanded and disgusting practice that i do not recommend this place to anyone , nor will i ever , and will find a way to let the business bureau know so that they can not do this to other people .
My final advice : stay away from this place and go to a mcdonald 's instead if you can because at least at mcdonald 's they do not try to pull this mess with you .
Seeing as they are brand new , there will be kinks they need to work out and i am sure the place is not completely finished , but that do not bother me none .
The youngest had breastmilk , but that was not on the menu .
We loved it and can not wait to try out the other flavors !!!
I had a gut feeling i should just leave , i mean a first time client and you are late and give me no update .
I mean who is not a bit nervous the first time a new person cuts your hair .
She revealing to me at the end and i was about to cry but i could not tell her .
I mean what is the point , you can not put the hair back on !
Not only that , she barely put any effort into styling it .
The plane noise is not a major issue , the ac drowned it out .
Do not take staffs advice on take out .
This one not so much .
I did not even get to taste the food because the service was so bad .
I will not be giving them any more money .
There were kids and families hanging out - no prob for me being from a large family myself , the weather was 90 degrees that day , who would not want to spend it in the warm , but cooling , water !
If you are in town for business , if you want to be near to the strip , but not stay on the strip , or if you are local and want to staycation for an affordable cost , i would keep this place in mind ! :)
They only get 1 star because i can not give them zero .
I had a water leak in a wall , no ones fault , it happens .
Plumber showed up later that day , still not a single phone call from on q. restoration showed up 5 days later , still not a single phone call .
I have left 3 messages at this worthless company and not a single return call .
I have no access to the bathroom or bedroom as the walls are torn out and taped up .
I guarantee they expect a full rent payment even though i do not have access to half my house and they have not done a single thing to get this moving .
Do not rent from them .
Do not do it .
Not the place to visit if you are hoping for hawaiian bbq .
Not too big of a deal .
I left upset at myself for paying $ 40 + on that meal and we will not be returning or recommending .
I do not love threading , but i like it more than paying $ 20 + tip to get my brows waxed .
And was greeted by no line ... score .
The tv in the living room is not hd ...
Word from the wise ... do not rent from this " management " company .
I went months without work orders completed , calls never answered , messages never responded too and now i am out my entire security deposit plus some .
Though i am very said that john 's country kitchen has been replaced , i guess having another eating place ( that is not just open for breakfast / brunch ) is okay .
I was not that hungry but the appetizer wings and a side of street corn casserole was more than enough to satisfy .
The result : roots somewhat match the previously grown out portion , however , the overall color is not anywhere close to the light blonde pictures i showed him .
Hmm , why was not i informed of this prior to my highlights and hundreds of dollars ?
Is it possible that : a. he did not listen and miscalculated the amount of time necessary to let the color process ?
All my years in hawaii i do not remember ever seeing catfish tacos .
She rudely states that she is " not even opening the reservation book yet as there are no tables open " but says it will be no more than 15 minutes until we are seated .
We patiently wait and at 6:30 we have still not been seated but we do see a group that arrived a significant time after us get seated before us .
We try to go up and ask about when it will be our turn and get cut off by the same manager who brushes us off and says " yep , we are working on it . " we do not get seated until 6:45 without even an acknowledgement or apology for the lengthy wait .
The manager , who was dressed in a way - too casual grey sweatshirt , had glasses and her hair in a bun , seemed to have no sense of customer service skills or how to respectfully speak to people .
The guy who answered the phone took my information and said it would be no problem to get the shelf ordered and to my house within a few days .
He could not find an order for the shelf but said he would take care of it .
I was frustrated , but i was not rude .
It did not .
I would not go back to this store because i know if there was an issue , i could not count on them to put their best foot forward and help me solve it .
When i ask about it , they did not do anything to make things right .
The chargers for some inspections / work performed by mammoth are somewhat overpriced in comparison to hiring a contractor on yelp , and they do not make an effort to check with other contractors besides their own company .
Unfortunately i did not catch his name .
We tried it and it 's not our cup of tea " her pizza was cold and no flavor .
I would stay here again , i was really bum that we could not stay at tahiti village this trip and had a sour attitude about staying at the tahiti but over all it was a nice place .
The pool was nice , refreshing and not crowded at all .
I felt that was a nice treat considering other hotels do not offer it .
They have a small putting green , not miniature golf ...
Love denny 's but this one is not that great !
They always miss bringing me something i ordered and most the time my sons food is cold smh tonight i ordered a side of gravy more than 3 times and still did not get it !!!
Under staffed and they do not pay attention !
My mom & i both visited her for spur - of - the - moment eyebrow waxes and tints and our eyebrows have seriously never looked better .
And i was not in a hurry so was patient .
I usually go there for their lunch all you can eat - and i am never disappointed with the taste .
I m surprised people say they do nt have ice cream / desserts with the ayce - as they do have , it s just not on the menu , u have to ask for it .
If you want a " resort " that pampers you and makes you feel like you are on a honeymoon or something , this probably is not the place for you .
Carb fest , not very impressive ) - room decoration ( comfy , but not very " tahiti " ) - no maid service during our 3 night stay ( it really did not bother me , but it might turn some people off ) - no bar or restaurant ( but there are a number of good places within walking distance , so again , this was not a huge deal for me ) - overall , not really a " resort " ( the pool area is nice , but there 's no service or pampering that make it feel like you are on a resort vacation .
Extended warranty not worth the money .
Six to eight weeks for washer parts is b.s. we have bought everything tv's , washers , dryers , dishwashers , and beds , sorry to say never again all do to with the worthless warranty they sell .
Do not get taken for a ride .
Got a full set costing $ 35 not including tip .
I went in to see if i could get them fixed and was told they did not have time to fix them .
I will not be returning here .
Noodle dishes were fine , have not tried the pho , and i would not suggest banh mi if you wanted something close to the real deal .
Then again , you would not be here if you wanted the real deal =d for an easy lunch that 's different from the everyday sandwich or hamburger , wok box has my endorsement .
Today is the 10th of the month and i was just told that my rent money is not going to be in my account for another 4 - 5 days .
I do not eat 90 % fat steaks .
They did not even apologize .
They said " i am sorry you did not like the steak " .
This is the second incarnation , this new one deserves to die , and not be replaced .
I stop to see what was this place was about , really disappointed , we have a party of 6 wanted to try something different but when i saw the menu was like a copy of viva chicken , we order the chicken with green beans , chicken was overcooked green beans from a can , i work in the business so i know when something is from a can , the rest of the party order the chicken sandwich , chicken was cold and hard , for sure we are will not be back
He apologized for the leak and said we did not purchase a warranty but he wanted to be sure we had the lg service phone number .
There was no need but it was refreshing to be handled with care .
The proximity to downtown scottsdale , my company , the waterfront and the " diamond in the rough " rent was not worth the headaches nor the proposed legal action i had to take against on q property management .
They try to con tenants out of their security deposits and lie about how the money is used ( it 's not , the company pockets it ) .
They say services are provided but can not provide proof of these services , they say invoices are " lost " when in reality they could call said " company " and have said " invoices " reprinted .
Thankfully , i was able to recover the money that they wrongfully kept from me , however it was not without headaches and proposed legal action .
The unit was not cleaned nor move in ready at the start of the lease and i was not given keys to the home nor allowed access to the home for approximately 1 work week . * this is illegal and against arizona state law + arizona tenants rights and responsibilities *. documented and certified demand letters were sent before i could receive keys to unlock my front door .
She did not comply with my request for 15 days .
I am 99.9 % positive there were no services provided and on q / the owner was trying to pull the wool over my eyes ... as a property management company , they are only loyal to themselves .
Conclusion : this company can not defend themselves against tenants like myself and others whom i have read similar reviews from who have documented e-mails , photographs , text messages and certified demand letters .
The fact that they could not provide a simple document and in turn refunded the remaining $ 200 of my security deposit , speaks * volumes * about their role in the situation .
Greeted by friendly staff , ordered pulled chicken as platter not sandwich with green beans as side .
Have not had anything i did not like .
I do not know how this place has so many good reviews every time i have been here with my family the always take forever they have brought out other people 's food before our food and we got in , seated , and ordered first and the other people came sometime after .
Dennys is just a horrible place to eat they have been going downhill for 20 years they have had so many problems and it still seems like they can not get there s*** together .
Updating my review to a 2 star because the guy who originally did my 5 - star manicure has not been there since .
I never leave 100 % satisfied .
I have gone back due to location convenience , but definitely not my go - to place .
It is not so brightly lit , and is quieter - conspicuously absent are the same 10 muzak tracks playing on repeat .
A la carte , you have more choices , and the rolls are more carefully crafted ( the ayce ones can be somewhat rice heavy , although not as much as other locations and restaurants ) .
You will not be disappointed .
Not happy .
First , i read the previous reviews for this place and i am very shocked the ladies did not have a great experience with their eyebrows .
The room i was in was nice and cozy , dim lighting , soft music & you hear no noise from the front reception area .
Should not call them a team because the implies they work together .
Had a conflict from 11 - 1 asked if it would be ok to request they do not deliver during those hours and they said no problem .
Told him of the request but he said it could not be changed so i ended up changing my appt to later than he did not show til later when my new appt my husband had to run home from work to find out they only had the washer they are stacked so not worth doing to redo when dryer arrived so he sent them away asking them to come back with both .
Problem is the drivers did not have the tools to change the doors so they worked properly for stacked so had to wait on friday for another driver to come out who had the right tools .
I prefer this location because even if i have to wait , it usually is not for long .
I do not write bad reviews unless i am extremely disappointed .
If you are going for the food do not bother .
These guys will not stay in business long .
Did not even taste it yet , i only stirred the crushed ice up and this is the amount of goods in the reg size cup that i paid $ 7 for .
Not satisfying at all .
I can not wait to go back again and try the rest of their menu !
I was not greeted or acknowledged the entire 20 minutes i was looking on the sales floor .
There were at least 5 / 6 salesmen that did not even make eye contact .
Did not taste too great .
They did that thing where they make you leave a tip while they wait for you to see how much tip you will leave .. will not visit here again .
I think just had bad luck and got a bad server and cook , or maybe their burgers are not that good .
There are so many out there so you never know what you are going to get .
My request went unanswered for about two weeks i tried again at least four different times my request was never answered .
When i told the guy on the phone what the address of the home i was interested in was he replied " ok well can you meet someone there tomorrow around 10 am ? " he said " it will either be me or someone else showing you the home " ( he did not even know who is going to be showing me the home !!! ) .
I said yes that would work out perfectly not wanting to lose this amazing rental and i hung up the phone .
I realized after i hung up i did not get a direct phone number from the guy on the phone considering i only had the main office line .
So the next day i am on my way there and i do not get a call from anyone saying that they are on their way or to confirm that i even have an appointment to view this home today .
When i got there and i punched in the gate code it did not work ( of course ) so i waited for a car to come out the exit gate and i went through there then proceeded to the house .
To my discomfort no one was there to greet me .
I waited for about an hour , never got a call , never saw anyone pull up to the home , nothing .
I did get one reply back from a girl about the home i originally wanted asking me what time could i meet her , i replied to the email and then never heard back again .
I can not believe that a property management company that is in charge of this many homes is this unprofessional and just plain awful !
Needless to say i never got my dream rental that i wanted because of their flaky business techniques .
I have read at least five other reviews saying that this shady company does not reply to your emails , phone calls , or even make an effort to respond to possible tenants .
Bottom line , this company should not be in business !!!
Between the annoying surrounding customers and the standard food experience i maintain my 3 / 5 stars and will probably not be back to have sushi but instead to try the hibachi .
But anyways , presentation was top notch but flavor not so much .
I was really disappointed by one of my rolls , primarily because it was not what i ordered .
Service was excellent but pricing is an issue and i unfortunately will not be returning .
Prices are listed " and up " which i admittedly did not notice when reviewing the menu but my total was very far from beginning menu prices for a very simple cut & color .
We were visiting in the winter , so we did not use the pool , but it looked like it would be quite the summer treat .
" look , you are going to have to wait , okay ? " keep in mind , there 's about six other people in the restaurant and no one else is anywhere near the bar .
This is odd because i was standing there for some time with no greeting , no acknowledgement and no signage telling or showing me they were closed .
I 'd be happy to leave it at that but her attitude for no reason at all was really a surprise .
I definitely will not be going back here ever again .
I know , i am not a vegan since i inhaled the mug with all it s fixings , but it 's a quality bite .
At one point , when he waitress came by with our drinks , she did not make a single sound to notify to us that she was close by .
I thought it was just me exaggerating but my fiance saw it from his side of the table and was furious but did not want to ruin the night .
No garnishing on mine or anything .
I asked for gravy and was told this establishment does not give out gravy so to just enjoy it as it is .
Ambience was beautiful but i wish they did not seat us in a shitty area knowing that they are not full ( we got there around 10 ) .
But definitely never coming back here again .
This is a wonderful go to that will never steer you wrong .
The concierge ( two different ones , actually ) were extremely helpful and never once strong - armed us for any time share crap .
With a menu that has a little bit of everything ( as long as it is not fried or unhealthy ) , even the most the discriminating foodies on a budget will feel right at home .
Delivery was a joke , only had one of the items and would not switch the door handles , spent more time taking off work waiting for delivery .
Then wine fridge has not worked since , spencers said it was out of their hands , the manufacturer sent an appliance person to fix it , still has not worked .
Have called spencers numerous times and gone in person to no avail .
Months later , i still can not use it unless i like frozen wine .
Do not deal with these people .
They get their money and do not care and are insulting to women .
It 's got everything you would need in an all - you - can - eat sushi resto : - fast , reliable service even during peak lunch time ( 12 pm ) - solid selection of sushi , rolls , and the usual sides - rice is not mushy , done well enough - great price ( $ 11 + tax ) overall , if you are in the area and hankering for some sushi this is a great place to go .
Really enjoyed the cold lemon tea , while my gf was not a fan of the hk milk tea .
Was not that busy around that time , half the restaurant was closed off ( empty ) while our half only 3 tables including us .
Not to mention i am taking maternity photos tomorrow .
Never again .
If you have not been - stop in !
The food is not very good at all anymore , most of the wines are gone and the prices seem to have increased .
By the way there were hardly any people in the bar or restaurant so they were not at all overly busy !!
I asked what was on the cheese plate and the bartender had to go find a sheet , when he came back he litter just read the sheet and had no idea what he was riding to us .
I then asked if i could get just plain french bread or something besides the cranberry toast that cake with it , he replied we do not have any other bread really .
It was dry and over seasoned , i do not recommend ordering it .
It is gooey and cheesy this was not at all !
Then the chicken comes out , mind you i still did not get the cheese plate which involves no cooking what so ever !!
Then they bring out bread drenched in butter / oil , i asked if i could get it dry , i had ordered it with no oil or butter .
Still no cheese plate anywhere on site they take the bread back .
He comes back with the cheese plate which was not at all what i was expecting and one of the cheeses definitely had some type of truffle oil or spread on it .
At this point i am over it and just say i do not care for it and he takes it away .
Street corn casserole - do not ask questions , just order it .
