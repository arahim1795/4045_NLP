I ordered my go-to the Bambu Special which consists of pandan jelly, chia seeds, coconut juice, coconut and longan topped with shaved ice. The jelly was chewy, had good flavor but was mostly stuck together and the coconut flesh was a bit hard (mature coconut?) other than that it was okay. Pricing was a bit steeper than usual, about a dollar more than I am used to. The portion was kind of lacking and wow factor was not there. They may be working out the kinks still, but it's good to see something familiar as it's hard to find places such as Bambu out here. Also, I think it would be better if they used an unscented table cleaner instead of the Chlorox-smelling kind they used.

Most of their drinks have coconut in it. If you are not a fan of the coconut flavor, they also have other smoothies and drinks to choose from. At this point, they do not serve any food or snacks (which is fine by me). They have photos of their signature drinks posted on the wall. It took me a long time to decide which one to get. When my bestie, Karen W, arrived, I decided to order drink #6. Oh boy was it good. It has plenty of coconut juice, huge chuck of coconut meat, 3 different types of jello, lychee and red Boba. I feel like I was having a party in my mouth. After drinking the whole thing, I was pretty much full at that point. I cannot be any happier to see that Chandler, Arizona is slowly becoming like my town Rowland heights in CA. With Boba place around the corner, Glazier snow across the street and now this delicious store for drinks, I am so happy that they are all in here.
