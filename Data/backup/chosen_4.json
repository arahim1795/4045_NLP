We had the Baby Spinach Salad with Strawberries and caramelized pecans in a house poppy seed dressing (excellent) in nice presentation bowls.

My husband and I each had a $25 off coupon from playing slots so we figured at worst it would be a mediocre meal for a reasonable price, but I am happy to say this place exceeded my expectations. Service was exceptional and prompt. We made a lot of different requests and they were able to accommodate almost everything. All of the food was good, even the bread basket, but here's a breakdown of what we ordered: Veal Oscar Roll - Very tasty, and pretty unique too. Served kinda like sushi (although it tastes nothing like it). They also sell this as a larger entr\u00e9e but if you want to just try it out without spending too money, this is a great. It only came in 4 bites though, so it was gone pretty fast. Definitely not something to \"share\" with the table. Portabello Frites - Husband LOVES portabello mushrooms, so he was a big fan of these. I am just so-so on mushrooms, so I was just so-so on these. They are VERY mushroomy. If you love that then go for it. If not, you can pass on this. Chopped Salad - Decent size and in a rather large bowl. It got the job done as far as a salad was concerned, and they were very accommodating when I wanted to switch out ingredients. She-Crab Soup - For the price, this was a little disappointing. We were hoping it would be a little meatier, but it's really just more of a crab bisque. We did ask for some Old Bay and while they did not have that, they were able to bring out some sort of substitute that perked this soup up. I'd pass on this unless you are in the mood for a bisque. Ribeye - VERY good. My husband likes his steak medium-rare and I like it medium. We asked if they could cut the steak in half and cook it differently and they were happy to do so - no plate sharing charge. Honestly we ordered so many appetizers we did not really need two steaks at this point anyway. The steak tasted great and comes with a variety of sauces. If you can not decide (like me) they will just bring you out all three. Mashed potatoes on the side were just all right, but I was pretty stuffed at this point anyway. Chocolate Decadence - It was my birthday so they brought me out a chocolate dessert. We were already pretty full but we can make a little room for chocolate cake. This was a hearty portion and it was a little too rich for me, but it was nice to finish it off with a sweet!  Sadly there is no piano player anymore, at least not when I went. When I asked management about it, they said he still plays occasionally. Overall this was a fantastic steak restaurant for a reasonable price.", "date": "2018-02-11 18:55:28"}, "8": {"review_id": "1Je4jhTYnIO2NzOOum06Mw", "user_id": "1zssDk1vmO6dbhDwOY2fzw", "business_id": "7e3PZzUpG5FYOTGt3O3ePA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Had a wonderful dinner with impeccable service start to finish last night.

Dinner offerings were limited to what appeared on a special New Year's Eve menu, so what was served was a bit atypical from what Waverly's normally presents. But the food was not that far removed from this restaurant's normal everyday fare, which consists of fancy steakhouse offerings and fairly high-end Continental cuisine. An immediate hit this night was great fruit bread in a bread basket, which tasted like raisin bread but better. Lobster Bisque was smooth and delicious, served in a bowl that contained a couple of big hunks of lobster which were tasty although lukewarm. Unfortunately, the same was true of a generous helping of Roasted New York Strip Loin which was well-seasoned and tasty but not very hot. But a warm Cabernet Wild Mushroom Demi-glace helped add some heat to the entree. Immediately preceding the main course were deliberately cold crab cake and good shrimp served with greens, carrot pieces, cut cucumbers, a bottle-shaped red tomato, almonds, and bacon in an interesting array called Waverly's Chopped Salad with Shrimp. Bacon Cheddar Au Gratin Potatoes were hot and cheesy, and good glistening green beans sufficed as a second fine side. Service was good, with very fast Iced Tea refills. Dessert was another unusual treat, which I will call \"The Dessert With No Name,\" since even the restaurant acknowledged upon being asked that it was a concoction Waverly's chef threw together, and did not name. With pieces of apples and a creamy cannoli-like filling in a pastry shell resting on a plate that was drizzled with chocolate and caramel loops, it looked like apple crisp, and had \"2012\" artfully emblazoned on its top. The dish fell apart quickly with a spoon, and tasted very good. Overall, this was a fine meal that would have gleaned five stars if only the lobster chunks in the bisque, and my strip loin entree had been served hot. I had never encountered this type of problem here before when meals were individually cooked to order rather than en masse on a holiday. So, I still regard Waverly's as the pride of North Las Vegas for upscale cuisine.", "date": "2012-01-06 04:09:37"}, "21": {"review_id": "HiKBFIvusoLinjMXgrxhhw", "user_id": "V4D4x4QtDB-tmXkwdxgwDA", "business_id": "7e3PZzUpG5FYOTGt3O3ePA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Wow, has this place gone downhill.

It has a single double door at the casino and it looks like it would be small & lowbrow. Waverly's is nothing of the sort. When you walk in you can see it stretch to the side and back. There are trees on the outside that mask the size from the outside. The decor is very upscale. If you come in in jeans they treat you as well as if you came in in your tux and fine dress. Waverly's is a fine upscale restaurant. Visit the link below to get a look at the menu. I decided to go with the Rib Eye on this visit. I started it off with a Caesar Salad which was delicious. I was surprised by it's size. Much larger than I would have thought. There was just the right amount of dressing & cheese, and the croutons were crunchy and had a lot of flavor to them. My steak was prepared just as I had ordered it. Medium rare all the way through. That taste was wonderful. Some times I have ordered steak and had to add some salt to give it some flavor. That was not the case with this Rib Eye. It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor the way a good steak should be. I choose a Potatoes Au Gratin as my side dish. The potatoes were about an eight of an inch cubed. I am not used to potatoes being served that way. Especially an Au Gratin. I tell you though, this was one of the best Potatoes Au Gratin I have ever tasted. The cheese in the potatoes let you know it was there, but did not mask the taste of the perfectly cooked potato. The seasonings were just right. I did not have to add any extra seasonings. I do have to say, if the order were doubled, it still would not have been enough. And the order that came was not small. My wife had the lamb and a side of mashed potatoes. My steak was so much I did not taste the lamb. I had a few bites of the mashed potatoes though. The potatoes were so fluffy and light. Whenever I have had potatoes that fluffy in the past, they were also watery. These were not like that at all. They were so light, fluffy and tasty they seemed as if they could just float away. My wife tells me me lamb was very tasty and cooked to a perfect medium rare. This evening my wife and I choose just to have water to drink. So, no info about the wines they have. Sorry. The service was pretty good. It started off excellent, but at some point they might have gotten overwhelmed. There was a period of over ten minutes that no one came by our table to give me a refill on my water. I had to stop eating my steak while I waited. I needed a drink. A bus person finally walked by the table and I flagged him down. He did promptly get me a refill on my water. He was also very apologetic. That is what has saved them from a very low service score. I do have to add, that a lot of people came in at that time and all the servers were very busy seating and arranging tables. Maybe that is what happened this time.

This feels like a really fancy restaurant that you'd be paying 50+ a plate to eat at even if the food is not that fantastic.

Based on the reviews of a few other people we decided to get the Portobello Frites which were absolutely amazing, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone. I got a steak and it was not any better or worse than most other restaurants so I can not really say come here for the steak but it was exactly what I ordered.

You get to pick an appetizer, a side, a main course, and you get a house salad included. First came the table bread. It was the most common, cheap, and cold bread you could amagine. 25 minutes later came a tiny house salad composed of diced iceberg. The appetizer; a cold half potato with what was supposed to be chicken inside. If there wad I did not see or taste it. The main course was surprisingly very tasty and the portion size was healthy. For the side you get 4 choices. 3 of them are corn. We are both not fans of corn so we chose the baked potato with sour cream and chives. When we recieved our main course there was a piece of a dry potato and an ear of corn. I was confused. I asked the gentleman who brought the food out who was not our waiter why we got corn when we asked for a potato with sour cream and chives. All he could say was ' hot plate' over and over. Since it seemed English was not his first language he had our waiter come over. Without apologizing he told us that he would bring over the sour cream. The other man showed up with one small portion for the both of us. When we had finished and needed a togo box I tried to waive the waiter down with no luck. On the fourth time of him being in sight he was forced to acknowledge me because both my husband and myself had our hands in the air waiving around like we were drowning. I had half my food in the box when I had to reach for my phone in my purse. The waiter came to our table reached over my open container and grabbed my half full plate and took it and all the silverware away like we were going to steal it. He never said a word. We were in such shock that he cleared my plate of food that we felt like that was the final straw to our horrific dinning experience and had to leave.

Every aspect of our experience was 5 star from the moment we walked in. The service was impeccable. I am a stickler for good service and everyone from our bus boys to our waiter was fantastic. I read the reviews before going to the restaurant and to my delight we had Frederick as our waiter. He received a lot of kudos from viewers and must say, when he introduced himself it made my day. Frederick was on top of everything. Our glasses were always full, finished dishes removed IMMEDIATELY and our dishes came out timely. He never missed a beat. Trust me, the food can be great, but when the service is not up to standards it can ruin the experience. Now for the food. I started off with the escargot. It's not often I find this on menus nowadays and it being one of my favorite appetizers I was pleased to see it on the menu..The escargot was not prepared in the usual butter-garlic-wince sauce. Instead, they added their own twist and the sauce was delicious. It had enough sauce for me to moyo (dip in bread) which I enjoy. Next, I had the She-Clam soup. It was nothing I'd imagine it to be. In fact, it was even better. Not your typical soup you'd find on a menu. This soup was top of the line. I ordered it for myself and know next time to order this for my boyfriend as well as he kept dipping into my bowl. Not that I mind, but this is the sort of soup you want to enjoy for yourself. I was coveting this like a hawk. Finally, the ribeye steak. It was cooked perfect. I like my steak medium rare and arrived just as ordered. It was tender to the touch and in my mouth it melted like butter. The chef knows what he/she is doing. I topped the steak off with scallops. Talk about sexy. Yes, sexy. Coupled with the steak, the scallops was a nice sidekick. Overall, I give Waverly Steakhouse a shaka from a Hawaiian gal who loves to eat and enjoys eating. I will definitely go back. I live on the North Side of Vegas and wanted to avoid the strip. Boy, am I glad we found this place. We are going to make it a regular stop.

Officially 3 1/2 stars, but since I can not do that, I am trending downwards.", "date": "2017-07-08 16:25:31"}, "89": {"review_id": "HkPE5GINyAsnED_a2J9wUQ", "user_id": "xsYrWuRf3zbRipSKqHL9QQ", "business_id": "7e3PZzUpG5FYOTGt3O3ePA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This Place is Awesome for its Location, Excellent Food, Great Staff - Our Server Nils was Outstanding, Once you are Inside you will forget there's a Casino Outside lol - Warm Plates for you to share, Smart Thing to do so your food can stay Hot.

All his suggestions were well advised. He new the menu & product well. Started with the chopped salad and added house vinaigrette which was very fresh and flavorful. Had the Portobello Frittes with pesto aioli sauce appetizer - all was fantastic!!! Service was outstanding - manager came by to ask about our meal. All staff was attentive. Had the shrimp & crab type of spicy gumbo over Jasmine Rice and the Macadamia Nut Crusted chicken. We'd recommend both!!!

My date's prime rib (end cut) was also outstanding. For sides, we really enjoyed their creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The only thing I did not love was the sauvignon potatoes, which were slightly undercooked.

I ordered their 10 oz Sirloin Special expecting to get the same quality of meat and thickness that I had received in the past. When i received my steak this time, it looked like a very \"thinly\" cut piece of breakfast steak. I have eaten better looking steaks at a cheap buffet. It looked as if they were running out of the special so they had to compensate with a cheaper cut. If I would have known this to begin with I would have ordered something else. I happen to like sirloins and believe me, you can get a much better steak from OUTBACK. When I brought this to the attention of the waiter and manager, they offhandedly said that I had received an end cut. I I had a center cut of the sirloin like I did before, it would have been a thicker cut of meat. Where is the quality control here? One day you get a center cut and the next time you might get a breakfast steak???????????? For a self-proclaimed upscale restaurant, this should be inexcusable. I was not offered an apology or compensated for an inferior and smaller cut of meat.

For an entree I paired a very good medium-rare Petite Filet enhanced by good house-made Bearnaise Sauce, with a fairly sweet Lobster Tail and Au Gratin Potatoes that were quite yummy. This time there were no temperature problems with the food; everything was served hot. Service was fine and friendly, and seating was comfortable in wooden armchairs with uphostered seats.
