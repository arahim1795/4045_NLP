Both sandwiches were MOIST, but not drenched with sauce. The pastrami meat was soft and not stringy like how it can be elsewhere. The cheese steak meat was also soft and gawd so yummy. HOW DOES THE SANDWICH STAY WARM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME I AM EATING IT??? That's what I distinctly remember. The sandwich is ~$10... and like 20 inches long or something. I may be over-exaggerating that part but alls I remember is that it was a LARGE SANDWICH and I DEVOURED THAT THING, no problem. And I am a petite female if I may add that. 2) Dining & Take out: Plenty of tables to sit at and eat the sandwich. No qualms about the to-go sandwich. Tasted just as warm and fresh as if I were eating it there, but then again I only had to drive a few blocks to get home. 3) Parking: Went here for lunch - no problem finding parking. More trouble finding parking at night when I ordered it to go. Bottom line: If you are looking for a DELICIOUS, mouth-watering, WARM, MOIST sandwich, then I most-def RECOMMEND this place.

We looked around to see what Pops wanted, and knowing him, he had to have his rice fix, so he ducked out and went to nearby Panda Express. Mom was surprised to see the size of the sandwiches, so I guess it was a good thing I did not order footlongs! Pops had a little taste and he liked both sandwiches and Mom was enjoying it as well. They both liked the fact that there was real turkey in the Bobbie and the great taste of the Capistrami as well. Now they have another food option for their next visit besides In-N-Out or a buffet!

First, I made a credit card purchase and one of their employees used my card and charged $140.00. The owner called me and told me how did I know it was his store and I told him that I had not used my card before then or after then. He told me that someone could have written my number down months ago and used it the same day that I came into his store. He then told me why was I upset since I did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money. I told him it was the principle and then he called me \"sweetheart\" and I told him not to call me that. Then he said what did I want him to do? I told him nothing. I wanted him to know and now that he knew and since he got nasty he could do absolutely nothing and I told him to have a nice day and I hung up. I do not know why people think you are always out to get something. Maybe owners need to understand that if their employees take peoples credit card numbers and charge $140.00 worth of merchandise on someone else maybe they need to call you with sincerity in their voice versus attitude and disgust.

This place sells cold, hot, and cap special sandwiches. I ordered one of their specials--Capastrami (cold slaw, hot pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, with Russian dressing.) REVIEW FOR THE CAPASTRAMI: i thought it was ok. The bread was soft--like slightly microwaved-soft (not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing.) The proportion was half cold slaw and half hot pastrami (with melted cheese and dressing in between). I was expecting the proportion to be more like 2/3 pastrami and 1/3 cold slaw, with the pastrami over-flowing and hanging over the sandwich--but it was not. Because of the proportion, the sandwich did not scream out \"pastrami\" in my mouth. In addition, i felt like the meat was way under-seasoned, which made it seemed like i was eating any other sandwiches with lunch meat inside. In conclusion, the sandwich did not lived up to its name.The only aspect i liked about the sandwich was the hot and cold textures. I probably would not come back for their Capastrami. If i want a good pastrami sandwich, I would go over to Towers Deli (@ Venetian) and get their \"New York Sky High.\" Boombb!!! **overall, the sandwich did not impress me, but it was not bad either.

The one thing I dislike about this specific location is that they only offer two sizes, while most other Capriottis offers three different sizes. The Red Rock location, for some reason, does not offer large sandwiches. Other than that, go and enjoy.

You have a choice of small or large but to be honest I thought the small was pretty darn big, so if you order a large it better be for 2 people or because you just helped a friend move into his third floor apartment without an elevator.  The first time I went in there, I grabbed a Capicola sandwich which is always one of my favorite. They were generous with the meat and the veggies that accompanie it were fresh.  The second time decided to throw caution into the wind and I got one of their signature sandwiches, The Capistrammi. Talk about a heart attack in wrapping! Thats not to say it was not good, because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm, buttery pastrami, coleslaw, mayo and russian dressing, you better not be on Cholesterol meds when you try it! Next time I go there I want to try their other famous signature sandwich, the Bobby. It looks like a full thanksgiving meal in sandwich form. I should start clearing room in my stomach now and I will probably be ready for it sometime early next month! Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing outrageous. You are getting a higher quality sandwich than at a lot of other joints, so its totally reasonable.
