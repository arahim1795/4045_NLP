The barg kabab was also not cooked all the way through that we only found out when we got home and ate some. There was another lady behind us who complained about the portion sizes and the salad. The salad we got was less then half the box and consisted of 1 cucumber slice and the end of a tomato that you would normally throw out. Was given another box of equal quantity of salad after complaining about it. Their orange sauce was doused in hot sauce and completely undigestsble unless you are into super spicy throat burning sauce. The lady returned the food and got her money back and I am thinking I should have done the same. Definitely will not be going back. The cooks have definitely changed because it used to be good.

It even has a similar style of ordering food and they call out your number when it is ready. You can choose to sit in or take out. There is a lot of space to sit inside. We grabbed our food to go. We ordered one of the chicken breast dinner and the veggie kabab dinner. They both came with A LOT of rice, salad, naan, as well as a creamy fill sauce and hot sauce. The chicken was in a sauce that was absolutely delicious. It reminded me a bit of piri piri sauce. Very flavourful. The rice is very similar to bamiyan as well. Brown long grain basmati. The salad was a nice way to balance all the carbs and protein. I used the creamy doll sauce on both the salad as a dressing and on the food. It was DELICIOUS. I would go there just for the sauce. The hot sauce was also really tasty. It had so much flavour and it was actually spicy, unlike Bamiyan's hot sauce (which is not even what I would consider mild anymore). I was impressed. The naan was also good but nothing special. The veggie kabab was nice. It held together very well. It reminded me of a veggie patty. There were quite a few spices in it and it is a great option for any vegetarians out there. I personally would not order it again, but only because there is one spice in there that I cannot stand, but it is present in quite a few Indian dishes as well. I forget the name. Overall the portions were massive for the price and quality of the food was very good. I could not even finish it all the 2nd day. I did feel like they give too much rice. It was a little disproportionate. We did wait quite a while for the food, but I did not mind, as long as the food was being prepared fresh. I would definitely go back, maybe order one dinner with rice and the other without and just split the amount between two people.

The ordering is also similar to Bamiyan, where you place your order at the cashier and then they will announce when your order is ready over a microphone. The wait was a bit long, but the food made up for it. Our chicken combo came with salad, rice, and naan with hot sauce and a white yogurt-like sauce.

Then, grab your own seat. The cashier will call-out your order number on the PA system when your food is ready. Unfortunately, the system does not work very well on a busy Saturday night.

[ORDER] - Sardari Kabab - $13.00: comes with chicken breast and a kofta kabab: chicken breast meat was a little dry, but paired well with the seasoning and sauces on the side. Kofta kabab was seasoned very well, soft, and juicy. Also came with a huge quantity of rice & salad. - Herati Kabab - $12.50: comes with a chicken kabab & kofta: chicken meat had the same consistency as the chicken breast meat. They used the same kofta in this platter and the Sardari Kabab. This dish also came with lots of rice and salad. I would just order this platter because it is less expensive than the one above, but the chicken meat is pretty much the same in both of them.

Kandahar Kabab is quite large but can become very crowded during peak hours (recommend making a reservation if you go with larger crowds). You order food at the front and they call you once it is ready, after which you can take a seat. The food does not typically take too long to cook and the portions are very generous. They also provide you free naan while you wait. I ordered the lamb chops and chicken kebabs which also came with salad and rice. The food was very delicious and I would likely take my family the next time I go.

It's usually very busy in the evenings & around 'desi' dinner time. Although the restaurant is big, seating can be a nightmare! The few times I have visited in the day, we found seating easily. However, at night you may have to wait for a long time standing around, eyeing diners who are almost finished to 'conquer' their table after. Finding a table along with other families also 'hunting' is like a flock of birds scavenging - 1st to fly over & sit has won. Sometimes families that are almost done are nice enough to let you know ahead of time. There is no reservation system from what I have experienced, no hostess to seat you either. You walk in, order, find a table or vice versa if you are dining in. I wish they would have a reservation system or hostess at least, it'd make it less chaotic. This chaos really brings out how polite fellow diners can be or show their lack of manners i.e. glaring looks, body shuffles to move you out of path to a table, dirty tables. I do not advise going their for dinner during special Islamic holidays or Ramadan, it's war people! It can be very noisy, with large families, young children & sometimes crying babies. I have seen young kids running around, tripping & bumping their heads, crying when it's busy - the parents do nothing & the staff do not say anything. Parking can be a similar nightmare. The cleanliness of customers versus the staff are different. The decor is nice compared to other Halal restaurants. The entrance & cash area have a nice glass water fall thing & some chandeliers. The benches & chairs are a leather look with marble like tables. The place is spacious - with the few staff that are at the front (usually 4-5), they do their best to clean the tables after customers have left their dirty trays or demolished an area with rice scattered everywhere & on the seats. When it's busy, tables do not get cleaned right away, so you might have to find a staff to clean it, once you have asked a member of your party to hold the table. Some customers, including myself, do take our empty plate & trays to the drop-off station. The staff can be friendly sometimes & sometimes like zombies. There is Afghani music playing in the background. There is a separate Wudu/Prayer area. To order food, line up at the cash & order off the menu. We usually order the chicken kofta kabobs with rice or the chapli kabobs. I preferred how they cut their salad when they first opened in Scarborough, I do not like the new style, it's cut very small & hard to fork. The salad is an average salad consisting of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers & onions. The meat is very flavourful & tender. Sometimes, on busy days, they run out of a specific meat by the end of the evening - so they will say no chicken, etc. Their rice is long grain & non-sticky. Their sauces are a big hit, I love the hot sauce especially. They serve Afghani bread with a white sauce to start. I usually skip the bread as it fills you up already & I can not finish my main meal. Prices are usually in the $11 mark per main dish. I like their mango drinks & yogurt drinks. Once you pay, your receipt has the order number & they call your number once your food is ready.

The food was good but not worth being treated like shit.", "date": "2017-05-21 22:17:53"}, "93": {"review_id": "IVnGdkdDH6OTJSe7N3yJPw", "user_id": "c2y6BT6X3XEnoOaxcFeSdA", "business_id": "Jcyu0ml7rxizEA8giSH-8A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Authentic Afghan food.

I find the portions and price the same as the more popular Bamiyan Kabob, but the flavours and taste at Kandahar are far superior. I always order the Kandahar Kofta Kabob platter that comes with filet mignon and ground beef skewered and grilled. The platter comes with salad, rice and naan. This platter is more food than an average person can eat and I always bring home leftovers. There is so much fragrant rice on the platter that is spills over onto the tray. The salad is a bit plain but tastes great with the tangy white sauce. The hot sauce that they serve is not too hot but tastes very good. The naan is crispy and tasty and does not taste like a brick like the ones at Bamiyan. The best part are the meats which always come out juicy, so flavourful and extremely tender.", "date": "2018-01-20 22:01:32"}, "95": {"review_id": "nbi7PTf9j9jgSPzJH5ImPQ", "user_id": "EFddU8cj_WTKTBFgdatFBA", "business_id": "Jcyu0ml7rxizEA8giSH-8A", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Food is tasty. Service is beyond hopeless. Cashiers are friendly but counter staff is pretty un-aware of wait times or what is or is not currently available. They are not familiar with service industries standards. Arrogant and obnoxious counter staff.  Cashiers are polite but the manager behind the counter does not belong there.  Restaurant is nicely made, they need a host/hostess out front to manage the incoming guests as it does get busy as any halal restaurant in the area.

Lots of seating. Went on a Sunday evening yand was really busy yet only had one cash open which was weird. Got the herati Kebob with one chicken Kebob and one beef kofta Kebob. Took about 30 minutes to be ready. As a regular bamiyan customer I will compare the two. Bamiyan wins hands down. The chicken was over cooked and te rice was too dry. Even the bread was not as fresh. Overall good experience but with bamiyan only a 10 min drive north I'd rather drive over for far superior food.", "date": "2015-06-08 16:08:12"}, "97": {"review_id": "AW9O-Mr_uVUKMy8ucOV2YQ", "user_id": "2_J91lZzqXOYyYeNcVd2YQ", "business_id": "Jcyu0ml7rxizEA8giSH-8A", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "The food here is amazing and comes in huge portions. I personally do not enjoy the pita and salad (especially the salad) that comes with the meal so I ask for extra rice as a replacement instead. One meal is good enough for two people. Definitely ask for extra sauce, tastes better with it. This place is kind of food court style where you order your food, get it and sit down and eat. There are no servers so you do not have to tip if you do not want to. All in all, great place for kabobs and rice!
