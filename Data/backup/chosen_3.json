The office seems also to run very efficiently. The surgery itself was a breeze, 1 hr of prep, and a 10 minute surgery. i did one eye per visit, and could see immediately afte, albeit sensitive to light. Dr Wellish is truly terrific. The follow-up vists were very accomodating to my schedule, and I am very pleased with my vision now - no glasses and i can see fantastic! One word of caution: with the choices in lenses, there is a great variance of costs. Some, my insurance would have paid 100%, others only 50%.

Next I went in to talk to Taylor, she sat down with me and explained to me in detail how the procedure works and what I can be expecting as we moved forward. She gave me some instructions to follow preparing me for my next appointment. I was instructed not to wear my contact lenses for 2 weeks, and to take some hydro eye pills to keep my eyes moisturized. The 2 weeks past by and it was time to get a few test done on my eyes. My pupils were dilated so they could see deep in my eye. Gabby was the lady that was running the exams, she did an amazing job and made me feel comfortable as she was guiding me through the exams. The next day was surgery day. I was a bit nervous because this is all new to me but I knew I was in good hands. Dr McCandless sat down with me and introduced himself with me, sat me down and told me what to expect. Prior to the surgery they gave me some pills to relax me and they did help me to keep calm and at ease. Once I sat down on the chair I knew that was going to walk out of the operation room a new man, with 20/15 vision.

But as I said, the staff are so great and the equipment seems fine so that's all that really matters. I have not been to the doctor since I got lasik a few years ago, and I mainly just went to get occasional glasses since I am still pretty nearsighted. This visit was prompted by the fact that I went to see a show Priscilla Queen of the Desert. From my sh*tty seat in the back, I honestly could not tell if some of the background dancers were dudes in drag, or just bigger ladies. That was a wake-up call about how bad my far sight really was..... Anyway, the techs were nice and personable both times I was there. Dr Langford was awesome too (very nice and cute), and I was surprised by the fact that he wanted to do a topography map of the surface of my eye just for his peace of mind to make sure everything was ok. He made the point to say that he was not billing for it, he just wanted to be thorough. I told him that I have insurance so it does not matter to me, but I was impressed that he was that honest and caring. I say this way too often lately, but my dumb@ss happened to get the date of my appointment wrong, so I showed up a day early. I was pretty shocked when they took me anyway. It did mean a longer wait time, but it was so nice of them to squeeze me into the schedule. I would have been fine coming back the next day. The only negative is that they do not do glasses on site, so I still have to find a place to pick out frames and do the lenses, but that's only a minor inconvenience.

I researched for about 5 years and finally found a doctor I trusted. The thing about lasik is that (unless this has changed) ANY doctor can certify to do the surgery. You do not even have to be an eye doctor. From what I read even dentists could certify. That's all fine and dandy (since the machine does the entire procedure) until something goes wrong and you are blind for the rest of your life. I am an over-researcher and found this guy who is one of, if not, *the* best in the entire country/region. One of our pilots at work recommended him after he told me about the stricter standards for air force pilots and that Dr. Wellish did his lasik. People travel from all over the world to have him correct their botched jobs.  I have large pupils and thin corneas so I only qualified for the all laser- lasik (where they use a laser to create the flap) which is a more expensive procedure. I think I paid around $3800 in 2009. They give you Valium before to keep your eye from moving. A suction device is used to keep your eye still (creates \"bruising\" on the whites of your eyes that lasts 7-10 days) It's like a hickey on your eye and it LOOKS awful and painful but it does not hurt at all. You have to wear these protective glasses 24/7 for a number of days (even in the shower) and you cannot wear eye makeup- I believe for at least a week. At that point you are instructed to only use brand new cosmetics to keep the chances of infection down. Mine went smoothly and while I now have better than perfect vision I do have minimal ghosting (which I also had with glasses) around street lights at night and dry eyes (but not as bad as when I tried to wear contacts on the plane!) I currently take 4 fish oil pills a day and that has completely resolved my dry eye issue but if I forget to take them I definitely notice!!  I am 110% satisfied with my lasik and would recommend it to anyone willing to do the research and find a doctor they trust with their vision. While I would do it again in a heartbeat I wanted to give you a better picture of the possible outcome. Many people experience visual distortions after the surgery and while I do still have a TINY bit of ghosting/halo effect around bright objects at night it was much worse for the first few months and I did experience some difficulty driving at night. I do not even notice it at all anymore, I am not sure if it has gone away COMPLETELY, or I have just become used to it. The only thing that continues to bother me is it's difficult/not enjoyable to read subtitles of white letters on a black background now so if you are REALLY into foreign movies, it might not be for you. Also, since you are probably not accustomed to wearing your glasses naked, you may be surprised that your butt is not as cute as you remember it now that you have 20/15 vision :0) Here are some links to check out: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/SurgeryandLifeSupport/LASIK/ucm061354.htm http://www.doctoroz.com/article/hard-look-lasik-surgery", "date": "2014-09-13 01:07:52"}, "24": {"review_id": "F2HuXkwuBYscVRjux_wD9A", "user_id": "Wamin4k5s07vLbx_jq4qcQ", "business_id": "a4GRh1TlOVhPD401mSPLZg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Dr. Sabouri is a great dr. and person.

He went first, and I went 2 months later... First off, I live in Summerlin, and the Wellish main office is a 45 minute drive each way. So add an hour and a half to each appointment time. Here is a quick run down of all of your appointments: 1) 1 hour consultation to see if you are even a candidate for the surgery.  2) 3 hour pre-op testing 3) 1 hour LASIK surgery 4) 1 hour day-after post-op 5) 1 hour week-after post-op 6) 1 hour month-after post-op So as you can see, if you do not have a flexible schedule this will be very annoying to the other people in your life that have to adjust to your 6 appointment times all within a month. My husband was lucky and these affected no one, however I have 25 clients and a 2 year old that all depend on me being at a certain place at a certain time. Secondly, my scheduled surgery day was canceled on me the-day-of and moved to the following day. Annoying, yes, but what can I do? Nothing. Did this happen to my husband? No, of course not. Finally, operation day!!! When you check in to the office they make it very clear that you must power off your cell phones. That's fine, after all, who do I think I am, Alec Baldwin? So while waiting for my 2 Valium to kick in, they send me to the \"quiet\" room to try and relax. I am in there no more than a minute when a cell phone alarm of church bells starts ringing for 5 consecutive minutes. My anxiety is now through the roof as I blindly (because I am not wearing my glasses) feel my way out of the room and into an employee break room to shut the darn thing off. I later found out this was Dr. Welish's phone which he chooses to keep on. I guess his cell phone frequency goes off his own special waves. What was my husbands experience like while waiting for his Valium to kick in? \"Zen-like\" were his exact word. Good for him. Finally, operation time!!! As I stumble in like a drunk lady with lead feet, I quickly remind the staff that my husband would like to watch the surgery through the glass from the waiting room (as I did 2 months prior for his). They assured me that they were aware of my request. The surgery was uncomfortable and felt like it took forever. I got bubbles under my flaps which had to be smoothed out, which was not at all fun. Did my husband have bubbles under his flaps? Nope, why would he? So I am now ushered back into the waiting room where my husband is eagerly awaiting me and the first thing I ask is what he thought of watching the surgery? Oh, they forgot to open the blinds until it was over half way over. Seriously? Just fabulous. I was beyond upset that they could not be bothered to meet my very simple request. Because of course they remembered to do it for him! A full week later, I have 20/25 vision, which is not yet perfect. But they say it can take up to a month. I required tear duct plugs to keep my eyes more moist. It's an uncomfortable process. Did he? No. And in case you are wondering, my husbands vision was 20/15 the very next day. That's better than perfect. I write this review as a combination of both of our experiences. Obviously his would have been 5-stars. I do think the staff there is extremely friendly and knowledgable. As for Dr. Wellish himself, he seems a little like The Great and Powerful Oz. You never meet him until moments before he slices your cornea open and shoots beams of lasers into your retina. He's ok with last minute schedule changes, not abiding by his own cell phone policy, and disregarding patients simple requests. But he will happily take your hard earned $4,000. He would not know who I was if I passed him on the street tomorrow, and he did my surgery a week ago.

Weeks prior to the procedure, he required that I stay out of my contacts, used artificial tears aggressively each day, and even added a unique Bio Tears oral supplement to my regime to ensure that the health of my corneas was optimal for surgery.

My eye sight is pretty bad, and when Taylor broke the news to me about not being able to go through with LASIK, I was not surprised. She was totally tactful and informative about my other options though, which was PRK (another form of laser eye surgery) or ICL (contact implants), and the different packages available. She was also honest about the pricing and what financing options were available, which is pretty much Care Credit with their promotions. She walked me through the process as well... When to start taking Fish Oil/Omega-3s, what to get in preparation for the eye surgery, length of recovery for the PRK, etc. Taylor also had her business card inserted just in case I needed to contact her for other concerns/questions.

The day of the procedure that was in July, we arrived about 15 minutes prior. It was a good thing too 'cause I missed out on some paperwork. So... Do not forget to double-check your packets/folders and fill that stuff out! Taylor had me complete everything before going down though X_x Once me and about 3 other patients went down to the 1st floor where we had our procedures, Taylor gave us post-op information before Louis prepped us one by one. Got to also meet Dr. Wellish before he proceeded with the surgery. Nice guy by the way - he talks to you during the procedure. The procedure itself only took about 15 minutes, so I was only there for about 1 hour max with all the paperwork, prep, surgery, post-op conversation, and waiting for the fiance to pick me up. Recovery for me, personally, took about 3 weeks to really recover. It was not a painful recovery. Just really uncomfortable, which is a nice way of me telling everyone that it was irritating. LOL. Had to wear goggles to bed for about 1 week straight, my eyes were totally sensitive to everything that lit up, had to time all my 3 eye drops out on a regular basis. I am currently down to 2 eye drops though, which consists of 1 prescription and 1 store-bought. Anyway... For every follow-up appointment that I have gone to, everyone is always courteous and extremely friendly.

As for wait time, I am going to admit that it can take a while sometimes, but I have got no gripe 'cause of how nice and informative the staff is. Okay, so let's talk money... PRK (alternative laser eye surgery) cost me about $4300, and I got to finance it through Care Credit. At the time, the establishment also had this promotion: 0% interest if you pay it off within 24 months, but would start charging contracted interest if you miss or late with one payment. I'd also like to point out that without insurance, the eye drops add up to the expense. With my insurance for one prescription adds up to around $64 for every bottle I refill, and I usually spend $18 for the store-bought lubricating eye drops (2 in 1 pack). There's also Vitamin C and Omega 3-Fish Oil (or other dry eye vitamin) you have to take on regular basis.

A few days after surgery I could officially see 20/20 and a week later I can tell that everything is healing bit by bit every day. Based on my experience so far, I will highly recommend Wellish Vision Institute to anyone looking to have laser eye surgery.", "date": "2012-10-05 05:39:25"}, "90": {"review_id": "EEzDTJ9HYb7hMHTwoDrVfQ", "user_id": "n21bnVqYVY6g1W9ca90jRg", "business_id": "a4GRh1TlOVhPD401mSPLZg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My optometrist recommended Dr. Wellish and his team. There's a reason why I'd been going to my optometrist for 12 years. I just recently got my LASIK surgery done on both eyes and am extremely happy. Dr Wellish and his staff were courteous. Beginning from my first consultation appointment, I was given all the information I needed and was made aware of what was to follow. I have already recommended Dr. Wellish to my friends thinking about LASIK, as with his experience and the detail to making sure your questions are answered all through the process is amazing.

My first experience with them was with my LASIK Consult; several optometrists in Las Vegas referred me to Dr. Wellish. It has taken me six years to finally get LASIK because I wanted to make sure that I found a surgeon that would not take any risks with my vision. I also researched the technology to make sure it is safe. The Wellish Vision Institute has the latest technology to give me the safest surgery possible and the clearest vision I could have. During my pre-operation procedure that staff was very friendly and professional. They were very approachable and were more than glad to answer all my questions. They took their time to explaining the procedure and made me feel comfortable. On the day of my surgery, I was very nervous but I knew I was in good hands because Dr. Wellish performed the surgery.  The surgery was fast, painless and best of all-I immediately saw an improvement in my vision. The day after surgery the doctor checked my vision and I was already at 20/15! I see even better than I ever did with glasses or contact lenses! The vision gets better as my eyes heal and I was back to work right away and enjoying the benefits of having great vision. I strongly recommend the Wellish Vision Institute.", "date": "2012-10-03 15:30:35"}, "92": {"review_id": "VFNkTRkGYvDKRX2VWNhhBA", "user_id": "4bWYsP6vLlAAbrqq1qhkMQ", "business_id": "a4GRh1TlOVhPD401mSPLZg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This office is such a pain in the ass.

This review is not on the quality of work performed by Dr Wellish. He did an excellent job caring for my Dad, who had cataract surgery, on each eye, 4 weeks apart. My father is very happy with the results, and the follow-up care was exemplary, particularly Dr Ortiz, who we both really liked. He was thorough and answered all our questions clearly. Again, this review has nothing to do with the doctors themselves. What ticks me off is the total lack of respect, this office has towards patients, when an appointment is scheduled for 1:15 pm, and after being moved from the front waiting room, to another, large. rear waiting room, it was not until 3:20 pm that we were called in to see the doctor. Another epic scheduling fail, was arriving for a 9:10 am appointment and not being seen until 10:45 am. To me, this is really an unacceptable practice, on their part, and it is a shame because I will not recommend this physician to others, based on their poor scheduling efficiency. Here's one more example... My Dad's first surgery was scheduled for 2 o'clock and he was not wheeled off until 3:40 pm. The shortest wait time we ever had was about 40 minutes. Whoever is responsible for scheduling this office's appointments really does their whole practice a gross injustice. My Dad has 2 more follow-up appointments, already scheduled, and I will update this review, as appropriate.", "date": "2018-05-04 02:43:57"}, "97": {"review_id": "I2Ttpnva6qcOke9VIoh9Gw", "user_id": "MyMCYKMcQfH2jz2jJxNbAg", "business_id": "a4GRh1TlOVhPD401mSPLZg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 7, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I went to the Wellish Institute for nearly two years.

They were not good at it, and had great difficulty with the process, causing more than one technician to try each time. The process was very difficult, and the lenses never stayed in.
