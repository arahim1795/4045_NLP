coup
de
coeur
oui
tu
bien
entendu
un
gros
coup
de
coeur
même
nostalgique
de
la
cuisine
vietnamienne
de
mère
j'avais
vraiment
envie
de
goûter
au
fameux
banh
mi
comme
je
les
aime
j'avais
entendu
parlé
de
vua
sandwich
sorte
de
fast-food
vietnamien
il
fallait
donc
que
j
fasse
un
tour
pour
avoir
mon
premier
avis
là-dessus
près
du
métro
berri-uqam
sur
la
rue
saint-denis
le
restaurant
est
foi
un
peu
caché
il
faut
bien
apercevoir
le

le
truc
c'est
que
vous
avez
le
choix
mais
vraiment
banh
mi
donc
d'autres
variantes
des
entrées
variées
rouleaux
impériaux/printaniers
sushis
et
des
desserts
typiques
vietnamiens
gourmands
sans
oublier
les
boissons
quand
tu
croques
dans
ton
banh
mi
c'est
un
bouleversement
pour
tes
papilles
gustatives
tu
distingues
bien
chaque
ingrédient
concocté
soigneusement
dans
ton
sandwich
j'ai
été
vraiment
bluffé
il
faut
bien
prendre
son
temps
pour
savourer
et
apprécier
ton
plat
et
la
cerise
sur
le
gâteau
des
prix
vraiment
attractifs
et
défiant
toute
concurrence
pour
des

comme
